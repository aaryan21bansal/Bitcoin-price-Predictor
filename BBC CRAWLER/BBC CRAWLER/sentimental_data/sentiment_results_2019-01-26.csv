"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains European powers have warned Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro that he must call elections within eight days or they will officially recognise the opposition's claim of leadership. Mr Maduro is under pressure after his rival Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday. Several countries, including the US, already back Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. Venezuela later rejected the ultimatum at a UN meeting, where divisions between world powers were laid bare. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told members of the UN Security Council in New York that Mr Maduro's presidency was legitimate, and the country would not be pressured into calling elections. ""Nobody is going to give us deadlines or tell us if there are elections or not,"" he said. President Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, leading to large anti-Maduro protests. He accuses Mr GuaidÃ³, the head of the National Assembly, of mounting a coup. What is happening in Venezuela? What might happen next? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Are you in Venezuela? Email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk On Saturday, permanent Security Council members France and the UK joined Germany, Spain and other European nations in what looked like a co-ordinated demand that elections be called in Venezuela within eight days. An EU statement was more cautious, seeking fresh elections or the bloc would take ""further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country's leadership"". Speaking on behalf of the EU, UK Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan said Venezuela needed a government ""that truly represents the will of the Venezuelan people"". Allow Twitter content?

Russia, a UN Security Council member, has said foreign support for Mr GuaidÃ³ violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"". China, Mexico and Turkey have also publicly backed Mr Maduro. Also on Saturday, Venezuela's defence attache in Washington, Col JosÃ© Luis Silva, said he now recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader and that fresh elections were needed. Discussions at the UN on Saturday were tense as nations clashed on how to resolve the crisis in Venezuela. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Russia and China of ""propping up a failed regime"" and said it was time to ""support the Venezuelan people immediately"". ""No more delays, no more games. Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you're in league with Maduro and his mayhem,"" he said. Nations clashed over a way forward in Venezuela's political crisis But Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, accused Washington of plotting a coup against Mr Maduro. He said the council was not established to ""support regime change"" and called for further dialogue to ""find a way forward"". China's representative to the UN, Ma Zhaoxu, said that while his country was committed to the ""purposes and principles"" of the council, the situation in Venezuela ""does not constitute a threat to national security"" and China ""does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs"". Analysis by James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent So, it's the US versus Russia again at the UN - this time over Venezuela. The old Cold War adversaries are sparring once more. New subject. Predictable game.  It's more or less ""my enemy's enemy must be my friend"". Washington says Venezuela represents a threat to peace and security in the region. Moscow says it is Washington which represents the threat, risking a descent into uncontrolled violence. For all the war of words at the UN, this does look increasingly like a crunch moment for Venezuela and its profoundly polarised society. He was re-elected to a second term last year - but the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed. The National Assembly argues that the presidential position is actually vacant because the election was unfair - and that under the constitution this means that Mr GuaidÃ³, as head of the National Assembly, should take over as acting president instead. This video can not be played Thousands attended a rally in Caracas on Wednesday against President Maduro Tens of thousands have held protests over Venezuela's economic crisis - including an annual inflation rate that the opposition says reached 1,300,000% last year. Mr Maduro has so far retained the support of the country's military, but Mr GuaidÃ³ has asked them to ""put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people"" and back him instead.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wants healthy people to become ""genomic volunteers"" to help scientists better understand diseases and human genetics People in England will be able to pay the NHS to sequence their genes on condition they share their data. Those taking part in the planned scheme will be given a health report which can predict the risk of developing conditions like cancer or Alzheimer's. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it will help develop treatments ""that will benefit everyone in the future"". But concerns have been raised over the plans by the chairwoman of the British Society for Genetic Medicine. It is possible DNA tests could alert patients to issues in need of further investigation. All data would be shared with scientists anonymously. Mr Hancock said: ""While healthy people should not have this service free on the NHS, there are huge benefits to sequencing as many genomes as we can. ""Every genome sequenced moves us a step closer to unlocking life-saving treatments."" The Department of Health said the project - which will be led by Genomic England, a company set up and owned by the NHS - is still in the development phase. No detail has been provided on a launch date or how much the service would cost. It follows the successful completion of the 100,000 Genomes Project in December 2018. Launched in 2012, the project reached its goal in December 2018 About 85,000 people had their entire genetic code (genome) sequenced. But because cancer patients also had their tumour DNA mapped, the number of genomes totalled 100,000 One in four participants with rare diseases received a diagnosis for the first time But Dr Anneke Lucassen, the chairwoman of the British Society for Genetic Medicine, said: ""The NHS has always been free at the point of delivery. ""It has the potential to create a two-tier system."" And she warned: ""You can use genetic code to confirm a clinical picture, but you can't use it to predict what will happen in the future very accurately."" Dr Lucassen said the government otherwise had good and sensible plans for genetic medicine, lauding its commitment to collecting research data. Genomics needs large data sets, ideally shared internationally. The government has now announced plans to sequence at least one million whole genomes within five years. In addition to the paid-for DNA sequencing, the NHS routinely offers seriously ill children and adults with genetic conditions and cancer DNA analysis. By Michelle Roberts, BBC health correspondent This isn't about looking for rare genetic diseases in people at very high risk. Those types of checks are already being offered for free to NHS patients. The idea behind Matt Hancock's latest announcement is getting data from the general population to help scientists better understand diseases and human genetics. He wants healthy people to become ""genomic volunteers"" to help research. From a sample of blood, experts can look for small changes or errors in our DNA - the genetic code of life. The anonymised data will help them build a picture of the nation's health and design life-saving new treatments. Genomic volunteers would be able to pay to receive a personalised report into their own unique DNA profile. But there are a few things people should realise before they consent: DNA tests will not necessarily give a clear prediction or definitive result Healthy people are unlikely to benefit directly from the testing And tests can turn up findings that may need investigating Volunteers may also be asked to take part in other research projects, depending on their test results And there are still many unknowns: How much it will cost? Where will the testing be done? How long will people have to wait for their results? Could it affect my health insurance policy?

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide At least 34 people have been killed and about 300 others remain missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. Rescue teams have been scouring the site near the town of Brumadinho, following Friday's collapse. It is not clear what caused the failure of the dam, owned by Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Vale has had 6bn reais ($1.6bn; Â£1.2bn) frozen from its accounts to help fund recovery works and handle damages. The rupture of the dam caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria, where workers were eating lunch, and at least one bus that carried employees. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, emergency services used helicopters and earth-moving machinery in the search for survivors. Some 366 people have been rescued, Minas Gerais state fire department says. Of those, 23 have been taken to hospital. Vale said it could not reach 252 of its employees and contractors. Residents and guests at a local inn were also reported missing. Eight of the victims have been identified. Relatives of those who remain missing await news of their loved ones Search efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to the area, the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Brumadinho reports. Even retrieving the bodies will be complicated because they are thought to be under a thick layer of mud, our correspondent adds. A bus that was carrying workers had been found but it was unclear how many people were inside. But three people who were stranded in a pick-up truck were rescued alive. President Jair Bolsonaro, who flew over the disaster area in a helicopter on Saturday, tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Relatives of the missing gathered at a warehouse set up by Vale criticised the lack of information. ""I want to know the truth. There's a disregard for everyone here,"" 43-year-old Sirlene do Carmo JanuÃ¡rio told the BBC - her missing 23-year-old son, Rangel, worked at a company's building that was hit by the sludge. The sea of muddy sludge swept over roads and destroyed buildings Earlier, state Governor Romeu Zema said the chances of finding more survivors were slim. ""We're likely to just be recovering bodies."" The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers lived, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed. Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the collapse may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had a capacity of 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area. After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government.

"Police are searching for the suspect, identified as Dakota Theriot Police in the US state of Louisiana are searching for a gunman suspected of killing five people, including his parents, in two separate but related shootings. The shootings happened in the parishes of Ascension and Livingston, south of the state capital of Baton Rouge. Authorities say 21-year-old Dakota Theriot fled in a stolen grey and silver Dodge Ram pick-up truck. Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said the man was ""armed and dangerous"". America's gun culture in 10 charts On Saturday morning local time, police were called to a trailer park in the city of Gonzales, 25 miles (40km) south of Baton Rouge, for a ""domestic incident"", Sheriff Webre said. When they arrived, they found two people - Elizabeth and Keith Theriot, both 51 years old -who had been shot but were still alive. They told the officers that their son, who had recently been told to leave their house and not return, was the shooter. The couple were taken to a hospital but later died. ""This is probably one of the worst domestic violence incidents I've seen in quite a while,"" Sheriff Webre said. The gunman first killed three other people in neighbouring Livingston Parish, according to reports. The victims - who were not relatives of the suspect but knew him - have been named as Billy Ernest, 43; Summer Ernest, 20; and Tanner Ernest, 17. Reports suggest Dakota Theriot was in a relationship with Summer. ""My family met him last weekend at a birthday party and didn't get good vibes from him,"",externalCrystal DeYoung, Billy Ernest's sister, told the Associated Press news agency. She said Summer and Tanner were two of Billy's three children. It is suspected that the alleged gunman stole the vehicle from the family and was headed to the neighbouring state of Mississippi. In a Facebook page that appeared to belong to him, there was a repost made in June saying ""wish i could clear my mind jus for one day"" (sic) with a sad emoji. In May, he reposted a message which said ""If you have a problem with me, tell me. Not everyone else."" The suspect is wanted for first-degree murder, illegal use of weapons and home invasion.

"Michael Jackson gave a young boy jewellery in exchange for sexual acts, according to new documentary Leaving Neverland. The ""devasting and disturbing"" film has been shown at The Sundance Film festival in Utah, America. It focuses on two men who claim Michael Jackson had abused them as children. His estate deny the claims saying it's ""an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in"" on the singer, who died in 2009. USA Today reporter Patrick Ryan was at the world premiere on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wade Robson and James Safechuck say they were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families. Now in their 30s, they claim they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson. He always denied the allegations when he was alive. Police raided his Neverland Ranch in California in 2003 while investigating claims he had molested a 13-year-old boy. The case went to trial and Wade Robson was a main witness for him. He said under oath that the singer never abused him and Michael Jackson was acquitted of all charges in 2005. Wade Robson used to perform alongside Michael Jackson when he was a child Since then Wade Robson has become a father and in an interview he said after two nervous breakdowns he finally revealed to his therapist the dark secret he'd been hiding. ""It was just pain and disgust and anger, the idea something like that could happen to my son."" In 2013 he filed a lawsuit against Michael Jackson's estate claiming he had been sexually abused by the singer, but a judge ruled he'd waited too long to seek legal action. The two-part film is directed by Dan Reed and the synopsis reads: ""Through gut-wrenching interviews with the now-adult men and their families, Leaving Neverland crafts a portrait of sustained exploitation and deception."" British filmmaker Dan Reed also made Terror in Mumbai and The Paedophile Hunter Reporter Adam B Vary watched it and posted afterwards: ""A deeply emotional Wade Robson and James Safechuck receive a standing ovation after the screening of Leaving Neverland. There will be a lot to say later, but I can say this: This is a thorough, devastating, deeply credible piece of filmmaking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is one intense film."" And film critic for US Weekly Mara Reinstein put: ""Shaking. Wow. We were all wrong when we cheered for Michael Jackson."" Fans turned the entrance to Neverland into a shrine after the singer died Because of Wade Robson and James Safechuck's previous support of Michael Jackson and claims that he never molested them, his fans have asked the festival to pull it, while his own estate has hit back at the project in a statement: ""The film takes uncorroborated allegations that supposedly happened 20 years ago and treats them as fact. ""The two accusers testified under oath that these events never occurred. They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations, which means the entire film hinges solely on the word of two perjurers."" They go on to say that because the filmmaker purposefully decided not to interview anyone else other than the two men and their families he ""neglected fact checking so he could craft a narrative so blatantly one-sided that viewers never get anything close to a balanced portrait."" The documentary will be shown on Channel 4 in Spring 2019. Michael Jackson always denied any abuse allegations while he was alive. He died on 25 June 2009 aged 50 after receiving a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"President Trump says a wall or fence along the Mexican border is vital for US security US President Donald Trump insists the US will still build a wall along its border with Mexico, despite ending the longest-ever US government shutdown without securing funds for the project. On Twitter, Mr Trump said the deal to temporarily reopen government was ""in no way a concession"" on the wall. The bipartisan agreement announced on Friday covers just three weeks. Mr Trump indicated he might trigger another shutdown or declare a national emergency if his demands are not met. The Republican president has vowed to reject any budget unless Congress includes $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) to fund his signature campaign pledge. The Democratic Party, which controls the House of Representatives, has flatly refused. US shutdown: Reasons why Trump blinked Trump official mocked over shutdown remark US flight delays amid federal shutdown In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said negotiations between Democrats and Republicans would start immediately but would not be easy because both sides were ""very dug in"". In recent weeks Mr Trump has taken a hard line against thousands of migrants arriving at the US southern border. ""The case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border and through dialogue. We will build the Wall!"" he tweeted. On Friday, the Senate and House unanimously passed a bill to temporarily end the shutdown, after which President Trump signed the bill into law. Following the votes in Congress Mr Trump tweeted that his decision was not a concession but was ""taking care of the millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown"". Unpaid federal workers used food banks and emergency kitchens to survive the shutdown Most US media saw President Trump's move as yielding to political pressure after the unprecedented 35-day shutdown. 'A stinging defeat': US media on shutdown Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump said federal workers affected by the political standoff, whom he called ""incredible patriots"", would receive full back-pay. Mr Trump also said he would not yet resort to ""a very powerful alternative"" - an apparent reference to declaring a national emergency. This video can not be played We have reached a deal - Trump Analysts say this could divert military funding towards building the border wall but would provoke constitutional uproar and legal challenges. On Friday, about 800,000 civil servants missed another payday amid the five-week closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Earlier, hundreds of flights were grounded or delayed at US airports because of unpaid air traffic controllers calling in sick. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted arrivals for about an hour at New York's LaGuardia Airport. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? Flights were also delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport because of staff shortages, the FAA said. Meanwhile, thousands of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees failed to show up after they were ordered to return to work unpaid,the Washington Post reported,external. The Trump administration recalled 26,000 IRS workers this week to handle the looming tax filing season. Trump's border wall - in seven charts How the US shutdown is biting But about 14,000 of them did not come back as of Tuesday, IRS officials told members of Congress. In a video message to agents on Friday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said: ""I'm about as angry as I've been in a long, long time."" Of the shutdown's effects on his agency, he said: ""It's mind-boggling, it's short-sighted, and it's unfair.""

"Mr Salmond has hosted a weekly show on RT since November 2017 Alex Salmond will continue to host his own television programme despite being charged with attempted rape and sexual assault, BBC Scotland has learned. Russian broadcaster RT said it would continue to air The Alex Salmond Show. The former first minister faced 14 charges at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, also including breach of the peace and indecent assault. He made no plea during the hearing and outside court he said he was ""innocent of any criminality"". The 64-year-old added that he would defend himself ""to the utmost"". Alex Salmond case: What's going on? Mr Salmond has hosted a weekly show on RT since November 2017. In a statement, the controversial state-funded broadcaster said it was unable to comment on Mr Salmond's court hearing. But it added: ""This matter does not concern anything related to the Alex Salmond Show or RT, and The Alex Salmond Show will continue on-air, as usual, at this time. ""It is important to note, irrespective of the findings on this matter in court, that we believe firmly in the principles of a fair trial, including both the right to justice for victims and the presumption of innocence, and that we utterly condemn sexual misconduct in any form."" Alex Salmond arrived at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday to hear the charges made against him Police had been investigating following a Scottish government inquiry into complaints of sexual harassment against Mr Salmond. At court on Thursday, he was accused of two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one breach of the peace. Speaking outside the court following the hearing, the former MP and MSP said: ""Now that these proceedings, criminal proceedings, are live it is important to respect the court. ""And therefore, the only thing I can say is I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I'll defend myself to the utmost in court.""

"The artwork was painted on a door at the Bataclan venue in the French capital An artwork by the British artist Banksy painted as a tribute to the victims of the 2015 terror attack at the Bataclan music hall in Paris has been stolen. The work, which depicted a young female figure with a mournful expression, was cut out and removed from one of the emergency doors at the venue. ""We are today filled with a deep sense of indignation,"" the Bataclan tweeted. In November 2015, 90 people were killed when armed militants targeted the venue during a rock concert. What happened at the Bataclan? ""Banksy's work, a symbol of recollection and belonging to all: locals, Parisians, citizens of the world, has been taken from us,external,"" the Bataclan wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. The theft, which occurred overnight on Friday, involved ""a group of hooded individuals armed with angle grinders"", AFP news agency reports, citing a source close to the investigation. The suspects then reportedly drove away with the artwork in a truck. Banksy's art has become extremely popular and sought-after. A piece of his work which appeared on a garage in the UK was recently sold privately for a ""six-figure sum"". What has happened to other Banksy works? Banksy's Dismaland pinwheel to go on show Banksy artwork sold for 'six-figure sum' Last October,Banksy made headlines after one of his paintings was sold for more than Â£1m at auctionby Sotheby's in London - and then immediately shredded itself. Banksy is a famous - but anonymous - British graffiti artist. He keeps his identity a secret. He produces pieces of work which pop up in public places, such as on the walls of buildings. A lot of his art is done in a particular style which people can easily recognise. He began spray-painting trains and walls in his home city of Bristol in the early 1990s. But in the 2000s, he expanded his work beyond Bristol and was soon leaving his artistic mark all over the world. Earlier this month,a piece of graffiti discovered at a monorail station in Tokyo, Japan, caused a stirfor bearing resemblance to the famous Banksy painting ""Umbrella rat"".

"A spokeswoman for Mrs Trump decried 'opportunists out to advance themselves' at her cost The Daily Telegraph has apologised ""unreservedly"" to Melania Trump and agreed to pay her ""substantial damages"" for an article it published last week. The paper said its Saturday Magazine cover story ""The Mystery of Melania"" contained a number of false statements. These included claims the US first lady was struggling in her modelling career before she met her husband and that she cried on election night, it said. A spokeswoman for Mrs Trump said she would not ignore lies told about her. The paper accepted the statements should not have been published and said it would also pay Mrs Trump's legal costs. Melania: I'm world's most bullied person Behind the scenes in the first lady's White House In an apology,externalprinted on Saturday, the paper accepted Mrs Trump was ""a successful professional model in her own right before she met her husband and obtained her own modelling work without his assistance"". It said the article also wrongly claimed that Mrs Trump's mother, father and sister relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Donald Trump. The paper added that Mrs Trump's father was not ""a fearsome presence"" and ""did not control the family"", as alleged in the article. It also accepted that Mrs Trump did not leave her design and architecture course at university for reasons relating to the completion of an exam but because she wanted to pursue a successful career as a professional model. A spokeswoman for the First Lady said she often encountered ""opportunists out to advance themselves by disparaging her name and image"". The spokeswoman continued: ""She will not sit by as people and media outlets make up lies and false assertions in a race for ratings or to sell tabloid headlines.""

"George Bell was Bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death in 1958 A statue of the late Bishop of Chichester George Bell will be installed at Canterbury Cathedral after further allegations of abuse were ruled ""unfounded"". In 2015, the Church of England (CofE) settled over claims the bishop, who died in 1958, had sexually abused a girl. A review of ""fresh information"" found""no safeguarding issues"". The Archbishop of Canterbury said he ""warmly welcomed"" news of the statue. The Most Rev Justin Welby said it would serve as a ""permanent reminder of [Bishop Bell's] unique contribution to international peace and to the Church of England"". Bishop Bell helped to organise the rescue of Jewish children fleeing Nazi Germany. The Church has apologised for its handling of the original abuse claim, after it was criticised by supporters of Bishop Bell who said there was a""strong case for his defence"". Archbishop of Canterbury said Bishop Bell's legacy was ""undoubted and must be upheld"" Senior ecclesiastical lawyer Timothy Briden was appointed by the Church to review separate allegations that were made after 2017. In a statement published on Thursday, the Church's National Safeguarding Team said: ""There were no safeguarding issues arising out of the fresh information and Mr Briden concluded that the allegations presented to him were unfounded."" He did not investigate the allegations from the original complainant. The woman, known as ""Carol"", first made allegations in 1995 that she had been abused by Bishop Bell in the 1940s and 1950s when she was a child. It was not investigated at the time. In 2013, she wrote to Archbishop Welby with allegations she had been abused by Bishop Bell. The allegations were referred to the police. In 2015, the Church paid Â£16,800 in an out-of-court settlement and apologised to the complainant. However, supporters of the bishop sought a review into how the Church arrived at that decision. In 2017, that review, by Lord Carlile QC, concluded the Church's response had been ""deficient"" and failed to follow a process that was ""fair and equitable to both sides"", adding the reputations of the dead were not without value. The latest review, published on Thursday, looked at allegations made by a ""range of people"" after the publication of Lord Carlile's report. The current Bishop of Chichester, the Right Reverend Martin Warner, said: ""The judgement from Tim Briden... brings to an end a lengthy examination that has drawn on the recommendations by Lord Carlile. ""The Diocese of Chichester has rightly been called to account for its safeguarding failures of the past, shocking and shaming as they were. We hope that the culture of the diocese has changed. ""Bishop Bell cannot be proven guilty, nor can it be safely claimed that the original complainant has been discredited. There is an uncertainty which cannot be resolved."" Archbishop Welby apologised ""unreservedly"" for mistakes made after the original allegation. He said: ""Bishop George Bell is one of the most important figures in the history of the Church of England in the 20th Century, and his legacy is undoubted and must be upheld. ""However, it is still the case that there is a woman who came forward with a serious allegation... and this cannot be ignored or swept under the carpet.""

"The US has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan and is part of a Nato mission there The US and the Afghan Taliban have made ""significant progress"" in talks aimed at ending the 17-year-old conflict in Afghanistan, the US envoy has said. In a series of tweets, Zalmay Khalilzad did not give details but said the unprecedented six days of talks in Qatar were ""more productive than they have been in the past"". He said he was on his way to Kabul to consult Afghan government officials. The Taliban also said progress had been made in the negotiations. However, a spokesman added that talks about ""unsolved matters"" would continue. Mr Khalilzad also emphasised that talks with the Taliban would continue and that nothing had been finalised.

The Taliban have so far refused to hold direct talks with Afghan officials, whom they dismiss as ""puppets"". They say they will only begin negotiations with the government once a firm date for the withdrawal of US troops has been agreed. Earlier on Saturday, Taliban sources quoted by Reuters said the two sides had finalised clauses to be included in a draft agreement. They envisaged foreign forces withdrawing within 18 months of the deal being signed in return for assurances that al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group would not be allowed to use Afghanistan as a base to attack the US. Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan Viewpoint: Why the US should withdraw from Afghanistan Who are the Taliban? The two sides have also found agreement on other sticking points including the exchange of prisoners and the lifting of travel bans on some Taliban leaders, Reuters reported. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. On Friday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani saidmore than 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killedsince he became leader in 2014. It is estimated that about 15 million people - half the Afghan population - are living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the militants are openly present and regularly mount attacks. Analysis by Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan correspondent The simple fact that there have been six days of talks between the two sides is significant - and shows how serious both are about trying to find a peaceful solution to this conflict. It seems there has been progress in discussions about the Taliban's key demand - American troop withdrawal - though no timetable has yet been given. In return, the Taliban appear to be willing to give guarantees about not allowing Afghanistan to become a base for international jihadists. However, this is a position the group has articulated for some time now, and it remains to be seen what other concessions they might be willing to make. The key question for many ordinary Afghans is whether a ceasefire might be on the horizon? That would provide much needed relief to a war weary population. At the moment the focus is on ending the violence - and getting the Taliban face-to-face with the Afghan government. But it's after that that even more delicate negotiations may have to take place - about the role of women's rights, freedom of the press and democracy in Afghanistan. Mr Ghani has previously said that the Taliban could be recognised as a political party if they accepted a ceasefire and recognised the country's constitution. Zalmay Khalilzad is the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation In December, reports emerged thatthe US was planning to withdraw about 7,000 troops- roughly half the remaining US military presence in the country. Analysts warned that such a withdrawal could offer the Taliban a propaganda victory. The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, shortly before the demise of the Soviet Union. Afghan security forces escorting alleged Taliban fighters The militants ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, imposing a brutal version of Sharia law that included public executions and amputations, and the banning of women from public life. They were driven from power by US-led troops following the 9/11 attacks which Washington blamed on al-Qaeda militants sheltered by the Taliban.

"Justin Trudeau (R) appointed John McCallum ambassador to China in 2017 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum. It follows controversial comments Mr McCallum made about an extradition case involving a senior executive from the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Mr Trudeau said in a statement he had asked John McCallum to step down, but did not offer a reason. The detention of Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, angered China and soured Canada's relations with Beijing. Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, is accused by the US of evading sanctions on Iran. Both she and Huawei deny those allegations. Canada 'alone' in China and Huawei dispute No politics behind Huawei arrest - Trudeau Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage In a statement, the Canadian prime minister said: ""Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China."" The veteran diplomat, Mr Trudeau added, had served Canadians honourably and with distinction with many positions in cabinet. He also thanked the diplomat and his family for their service. Mr McCallum caused controversy on Tuesday when he publicly argued that the US extradition request for Ms Meng was seriously flawed. The next day he issued a statement saying that he ""misspoke"" and regretted that his comments had created ""confusion"". But on Friday he was quoted as saying it would be ""great for Canada"" if the US dropped the request. Mr McCallum was appointed Canada's ambassador to China in 2017, stepping down as the immigration minister. Canadian media say he was eager to take over the posting because of his strong personal connection to China. Mr McCallum's wife is ethnically Chinese, and he had a large Chinese-Canadian population in his former constituency in Ontario. Mr McCallum also served as Canada's defence minister in 2002-03. She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (Â£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Meng Wanzhou denies all the allegations against her Earlier this month, US officials confirmed they planned to pursue the extradition of Ms Wanzhou. Washington has 60 days to file a formal demand for extradition, a deadline that will be reached 30 January. US to 'move ahead with Huawei executive extradition' The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Why Huawei matters in five charts China's foreign ministry has urged US officials to withdraw the arrest order and refrain from moving ahead with the extradition request. Ms Meng's case has led to rising diplomatic tensions between Canada and China. Canadian nationals Michael Spavor (left) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" Earlier this month,a Canadian man was sentenced to death in Chinaafter a court said a jail term of 15 years was too lenient. Two other Canadians - businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrg - were arrested following the detention of Ms Meng. Some China analysts believe that the arrests were a tit-for-tat response to her detention, a claim Chinese officials have denied.

"Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself acting president on 23 January 2019 On 23 January 2019, a little-known Venezuelan lawmaker took the oath of office declaring himself interim president in front of a crowd of cheering supporters in central Caracas. It was a bold move by the youngest person to have been elected to lead the National Assembly. Thirty-five years old at the time, Juan GuaidÃ³ was chosen for the post after better-known candidates were arrested or had gone into political exile. In a rousing speech, he argued that the 2018 re-election of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro was illegitimate and that the presidency was vacant. With the constitution in hand, he said it was now up to him as the Speaker of the National Assembly, the only institution controlled by the opposition, to lead the country out of the economic and political crisis it was mired in. He promised an ""end to the usurpation [of President Nicolas Maduro], [to create] a transitional government and have free elections"". Mr GuaidÃ³ gave Venezuelans opposed to the government hope that he would bring about change swiftly He was quickly recognised as the legitimate leader by the US, Venezuela's neighbours Brazil and Colombia and many other Latin American countries. The list of nations siding with the young lawmaker soon grew to more than 50. Many Venezuelans cheered him and his prediction that he would be governing from the presidential palace ""within months"". They also applauded his promise to bring in humanitarian aid to alleviate widespread shortages of basic goods. His attempt to get lorries full of aid into Venezuela failed But a plan to deliver US-backed aid in trucks from Colombia into Venezuela on 23 February 2019 turned out to be one of his first major setbacks. The government of President Maduro blocked the border crossing and chaotic scenes ensued during which a truck caught fire. The Venezuelan opposition and the US said President Maduro's security forces had set the truck alight on purpose buta New York Times investigation later revealed that it had caught fire when a petrol bomb thrown by a supporter of Mr GuaidÃ³ landed on the lorry,external. What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Venezuela crisis in 300 words Many supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ were disappointed when the promised aid did not reach them and attendance at rallies he called dwindled. A little over two months later, on 30 April 2019, Mr GuaidÃ³ appeared in a video surrounded by men in uniform and declared that members of the ""military family"" had joined him to bring about ""the definitive cessation of the usurpation"". But his attempt at getting the armed forces to switch sides failed as only a few dozen soldiers joined him. The government of NicolÃ¡s Maduro labelled it an attempted coup and cracked down even harder on the opposition. Mr GuaidÃ³ came under further criticism from parts of the opposition for sending representatives to exploratory talks with the Venezuelan government held in Norway. The talks quickly stalled with Mr GuaidÃ³'s detractors saying it was further proof that he lacked the decisiveness necessary to oust Mr Maduro. A year on from his election as Speaker, the limits of Mr GuaidÃ³'s powers were brought into sharp focus when the National Guard barred him from entering the National Assembly building. This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³ tried to climb over a fence to enter the National Assembly building Government supporters ridiculed Mr GuaidÃ³ for failing to clamber over the metal railings surrounding the building as police pushed him back. They said the scene was ""ridiculous"" and that he had been ""humiliated"". But the scenes of police in riot gear surrounding the legislative palace and denying entry to an elected parliamentarian had a very different effect outside of Venezuela. Mr GuaidÃ³ was pushed back by members of the National Guard in riot gear It thrust Mr GuaidÃ³ back into the limelight and governments which had not come out in his support previously, such as Mexico, did and condemned the harassment he had suffered. Following his re-election as Speaker, Mr GuaidÃ³ defied a travel ban against him to slip across the border to Colombia, where he was received with full presidential honours. He also embarked on a tour of Europe to drum up support for ""concrete measures"" to remove Mr Maduro from office. But with Mr Maduroboasting to the Washington Post,externalthat he has ""outfoxed"" his opponents it is hard to see how Mr GuaidÃ³ can make good on his promise to remove the socialist leader from office in the short term.

"A demonstrator holds a sign reading 'We have a free Venezuela' during anti-Maduro protests in Colombian capital BogotÃ¡ The political crisis in Venezuela has taken a dramatic new turn with the decision by US President Donald Trump and several Latin American countries to recognise the opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as the country's interim president. Their decision has inevitably inflamed tensions, bolstering critics of socialist President NicolÃ¡s Maduro who, in response, has cut ties with Washington. So what happens next? Our diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus and Latin America online editor Vanessa Buschschluter look at what could change - both inside and outside Venezuela. NicolÃ¡s Maduro has served as president of Venezuela since 2013 Jonathan Marcus:In a sense, the declarations from the US, Canada and a number of other Latin American countries, including Venezuela's neighbours Brazil and Colombia, change everything and nothing. Juan GuaidÃ³: US backs opposition leader as Venezuela president Venezuela crisis: How the political situation escalated Who is parliament leader Juan GuaidÃ³? President Maduro retains the levers of power. His opponents, of course, will be emboldened, but this could simply be a recipe for civil strife and repression. Two parallel governments recognised by different countries abroad means little if President Maduro retains the support of the forces of law and order, and especially the military. In such a situation, Venezuela's economic chaos is only likely to get worse. Vanessa Buschschluter:Events in Venezuela are notoriously hard to predict because neither the government nor the opposition are monolithic groups. Instead they are made up of factions that often disagree, and the faction that holds power can shift quickly. Mr GuaidÃ³ has energised Venezuela's opposition since he became head of the National Assembly The last mass protests in Venezuela were in 2017. The government's response was quick. The National Guard fired tear gas and rubber bullets and - in some cases - live rounds. The deaths quickly mounted and were well over 100 on both sides of the political divide. The UN said,externalthe security forces had used disproportionate force and arbitrary detentions to instil fear. This video can not be played Thousands gather for rally against Venezuela's Maduro In August 2017, after more than four months, the protests died down with many of those who had formerly taken to the streets saying they did not want to risk their lives or face arrest. Whether there will be unrest in the wake of Mr GuaidÃ³'s move to declare himself acting president will depend largely on the reaction of Venezuela's security forces to the renewed protest marches. Jonathan Marcus:The Trump administration has a variety of tools at its disposal. It could step up economic sanctions; it could reinforce asset freezes targeted against individuals or entities associated with the Maduro government. It could also put the government and its military commanders on notice that any attacks on civilians or stepped-up repression will be closely monitored and documented, with the possibility of some form of international judicial involvement in the future. But economic sanctions are a blunt instrument and, in an impoverished society, are only likely to make things even worse for ordinary people. Jonathan Marcus:Despite his rhetoric, President Trump is remarkably risk-averse in terms of military deployments. After all, this is the president who is pulling US troops out of Syria and reportedly wants to slash US forces in Afghanistan by half. It is unlikely that he will want to send the marines into Venezuela in current circumstances. However, if the country descended into total chaos, there might be calls from some quarters for intervention. That would require significant international support - especially from within Latin America - and probably backing at the UN Security Council, too. Members of Venezuela's military leadership have expressed their support for Maduro It is hard to see this being forthcoming, given Russia's support for President Maduro and China's traditional opposition to what it sees as meddling in individual countries' affairs. At the moment, there is only one military that matters and that is in Venezuela itself. In past upsurges of protest, the armed forces have stood by President Maduro. Will this remain the case? It is their loyalty which will determine the fate of the current regime. But if the military or wider security forces split, then this again could simply lead to greater violence. Vanessa Buschschluter:The security forces have so far been loyal to President Maduro and his government. Mr Maduro has kept them on his side by regularly raising their wages and rewarding them for their loyalty. He has also put senior military officials in key posts in the government. But with Venezuela's economy further deteriorating, the lower ranks are reportedly getting increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which they blame for the shortages of medicines and food and frequent power and water cuts. A video widely shared on social media after an aborted rebellion by a small group of National Guardsmen on 14 January shows one of them complaining about the fact his mother cannot get cancer drugs. Footage uploaded to social media after Wednesday's protests also appeared to show a group of National Guardsmen blocking a road but walking away as protesters approached, to the applause of those marching. However, the higher ranks still appear to be loyal to Mr Maduro. On Thursday, Defence Minister Gen Vladimir Padrino read out a statement condemning what he called an attempted coup d'etat, which he said was backed by the extreme right and ""criminal agents"". Jonathan Marcus:Russia - one of Venezuela's few backers  - has taken exception to President Trump's decision. It has warned the US not to intervene militarily. A Kremlin spokesman has said that outside interference in the country is ""unacceptable"". Russia has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry. It has close military ties with the country. Last December, for example, two Russian long-range bombers flew to Venezuela as a gesture of support for President Maduro, angering Washington, which has sought to isolate him. The European Union has called for a political process leading to free and fair elections. Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country still recognises NicolÃ¡s Maduro as Venezuela's leader It is almost like a throw-back to the Cold War days, though with a new twist. The Turkish government too has backed President Maduro - a move which, for some, will place Turkey into an emerging axis of more authoritarian-leaning governments. Latin America, too, is dividing along political lines with Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Paraguay and Costa Rica all backing the US move. Bolivia's President Evo Morales - a strong critic of Mr Trump - has attacked what he has called an imperialist assault on South America's right to democracy and self-determination. This traditional resort to the cry of ""Yankee imperialism"" may resonate less today than it once did in Latin America. But the Venezuela crisis will not be helped if it becomes subsumed into the wider tensions between Washington and Moscow. Still, the real political battle is on the ground in Venezuela itself. The opposition may have the bulk of the external political support. But it is Venezuela's military and its own people who have to determine their destiny. This week may mark a turning point but the choice could still be between a resolution or worsening chaos. Vanessa Buschschluter:For the first time in years, the opposition appears to be uniting around a single leader. Juan GuaidÃ³ may be relatively new to politics but he appears to have inspired those critical of President Maduro in a way other opposition leaders before him did not. He also appealed to those who have so far supported the government to join the protest movement. Referring to anti-government protests which broke out in government strongholds earlier this week, he wrote: ""The protests in the west of Caracas show that there's no barrier to jump. Here we're all in the same shoes: without electricity, without medicines, without gas and with an uncertain future. We're all in mired in the same crisis,""he wrote on Twitter,external. Venezuelan police have clashed with thousands of protestors since Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" The protests in the poorer areas of Caracas are also a key signal that anti-government sentiment is no longer confined to the middle and upper classes. In the past, the poorest sectors of society tended to be the staunchest supporters of the government as they were the recipients of government-funded aid programmes such as social housing. But footage of people banging pots and shouting ""Maduro go"" in some of these areas would suggest that their loyalty can no longer be taken for granted.

"Many Venezuelans want to see President Maduro gone from power but he remains in the presidential palace In Venezuela, the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and the opposition are engaged in a bitter power struggle. The South American country has been caught in a downward spiral for years with growing political discontent further fuelled by skyrocketing hyperinflation, power cuts, and shortages of food and medicine. More than 5.6 million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years. So what exactly is behind the crisis rocking Venezuela? This would be an unusual question to ask in most countries, but in Venezuela many want to know exactly that after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself acting president on 23 January 2019. Some countries say NicolÃ¡s Maduro (L) is the legitimate president while others are backing Juan GuaidÃ³ The move was a direct challenge to the power of President Maduro, who had been sworn in to a second six-year term in office just two weeks previously. Not surprisingly, President Maduro did not take kindly to his rival's move, which he condemned as a ploy by the US to oust him. He also said that he was the constitutional president and would remain so. Despite attempts by Mr GuaidÃ³ to get the military to switch their allegiance to him, the armed forces have remained largely loyal to President Maduro, whose socialist party has also got a firm grip on the electoral body and the supreme court. NicolÃ¡s Maduro was first elected in April 2013after the death of his socialist mentor and predecessor in office, Hugo ChÃ¡vez. At the time, he won by just 1.6 percentage points. During his first term, the economy went into freefall and many Venezuelans blame him and his socialist government for the country's decline. NicolÃ¡s Maduro was elected in 2013, after his mentor Hugo ChÃ¡vez died Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second six-year term in May 2018in highly controversial polls, which most opposition parties boycotted. Many candidates had been barred from running while others had been jailed or fled the country for fear of being imprisoned, and the opposition parties argued that the poll was neither free nor fair. Mr Maduro's re-election was not recognised by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which labelled Mr Maduro a ""usurper"" and argued that the presidency was vacant. Citing articles in the constitution which in such cases call for the leader of the National Assembly to step in, Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself acting president. More than 50 countries recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as the legitimate president, among them the US and many nations in Latin America. But Russia and China, among others, stood by President Maduro. Despite his broad international support, Mr GuaidÃ³ does not wield much power in practical terms. Juan GuaidÃ³ has been trying to dislodge Mr Maduro from power but the latter remains in the presidential palace The security forces have so far remained loyal to Mr Maduro, who has rewarded them with frequent pay rises and put high-ranking military men in control of key posts and industries. Mr Maduro remains in the presidential palace and some Venezuelans have become disillusioned by the failure of Mr GuaidÃ³ to dislodge his rival from power. Mr Maduro has the military on his side and has also got the support of the Bolivarian militia Talks between the government and the opposition held in 2019 made no progress. The US has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela and on Mr Maduro and his inner circle but they have failed to weaken Mr Maduro enough to drive him from office. Some analysts argue that they offer the Maduro government a convenient scapegoat to blame for the dire state of the economy. Some of the problems go back a long time. However, it is President Maduro and his predecessor Hugo ChÃ¡vez who are the target of much of the current anger. Before the coronavirus pandemic, there were large anti-Maduro protests When Mr ChÃ¡vez became president in 1999, he promised, among other things, to drive down Venezuela's huge levels of inequality. While he managed to reduce inequality during his time in power, some of the socialist polices he brought in backfired. Take price controls, for example, which were aimed at making basic goods more affordable to the poor by capping the price of flour, cooking oil and toiletries. The controls meant that many Venezuelan businesses stopped production because they no longer made a profit, eventually resulting in shortages. A loosening of foreign currency controls originally brought in by President ChÃ¡vez in 2003 has eased those shortages as traders can sell goods in dollars but that means they have again become largely unaffordable to the poor or those without access to the US currency. Even street vendors have resorted to using US dollars Years of lack of investment in infrastructure further exacerbated by the more recent US sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector have crippled this key industry, which provides almost all of Venezuela's government revenue. Venezuela has been in the grip of an economic crisis for years now with hyperinflation one of the main problems. Business news website Bloomberg has been tracking the price of a cup of coffee in the Venezuelan capital,external, Caracas, to show how prices have increased. It has measured an increase of 2,597% in the 12 months to 1 August 2021 with a cup of coffee costing 7.8 million bolivares. According to figures compiled by the United Nations, more than 5.6 million Venezuelans have left the country since the crisis started to bite in 2014. The 'brutal' migrant route made tougher by pandemic The government has disputed the figures, saying they are inflated by ""enemy countries"". This video can not be played What drives someone to cross South America on foot? The majority of those leaving have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, from where some move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil.

"Electricity supplies to Our Power customers are ""secure"" Edinburgh-based Our Power, which has 38,000 customers, has gone out of business. Its website said the interests of customers would be protected and power supplies were ""secure"". The jobs of 70 members of staff at the not-for-profit company are at risk. An administrator is expected to be appointed on 31 January. The Scottish government is thought to have lost nearly Â£10m in loans to the failed energy supplier. The firm was set up four years ago with thehigh-profile support of Scottish ministers. By buying energy at wholesale rates for housing association tenants, it was expected to save them money and reduce fuel poverty. The government agreed to three commercial rate loans, totalling Â£9.5m, alongside social investors and after making checks into the business plans. In a letter to customers, the company's CEO, Dawn Muspratt, blamed the company's collapse on several factors. The firm was forced to implement a new billing system in 2018 after their system was withdrawn from the market. This resulted in bills being issued late and cashflow issues. Volatile wholesale gas and electricity markets meant a lot of cash was taken out of the business. And changes to the energy industry, including regulated price caps, made it difficult to grow the customer base. Our Power joins a long list of small providers that have gone bust recently, includingEconomy Energy,Spark Energy,Extra Energy,Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select and Usio Energy. The regulator Ofgem said it would choose a new supplier to take on the customers ""as quickly as possible"". It said repayment meters can be topped up as normal and the outstanding credit balances of domestic customers would be honoured. A statement to customers has been posted on the company's website Ofgem director for future retail markets Philippa Pickford said: ""Our message to energy customers with Our Power is there is no need to worry, as under our safety net we will make sure your energy supplies are secure and your credit balance is protected. ""Ofgem will now choose a new supplier for you, ensuring you get the best deal possible. ""Whilst we're doing this, our advice is to 'sit tight' and don't switch. You can rely on your energy supply as normal."" She added: ""We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff."" The Scottish government said it was disappointed to learn the company had ceased trading. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ""The Scottish government has supported Our Power in its aim of tackling fuel poverty since 2015. ""This will be a worrying time for all the employees"" She added that support for staff would be available through the government's Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace) scheme.

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Nearly 300 people are missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. The break caused a sea of muddy sludge that buried the dam's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch on Friday. Rescue teams used earth-moving machinery at the site near the town of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state. State governor Romeu Zema said there was little chance of finding people alive. So far 11 people have been confirmed dead. It is not clear what caused the collapse of the dam, owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, President Jair Bolsonaro flew over the disaster area in a helicopter. He tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. Also on Saturday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama) issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Meanwhile a sum of 5bn reais has been frozen from Vale's accounts by a court to help fund recovery works and handle damage claims. The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what is consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers live, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed at the time of the accident. But Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the accident may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. The Globo website later reported that rescue officials provided the following breakdown on the number of the missing: Between 100 and 150 people in the administrative area close to the burst dam About 30 people in the Vila VÃ©rtico area About 35 people at Nova Estancia Inn Between 100 and 140 people in the Parque das Cachoeiras Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed. Many other residents have been evacuated as a safety measure. ""I'm anxious, I want news,"" 28-year-old Helton Pereira told the BBC as he waited outside a hospital in nearby Belo Horizonte - his 28-year-old wife and 35-year-old sister worked at the dam's cafeteria and were both missing. ""From now, the odds are minimal and it's most likely we'll recover only bodies,"" Governor Zema said. The dam is owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale Hopes are fading for survivors The powerful current swept everything in its way Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had capacity for 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. Mr Schvartsman called it a ""human tragedy"" and said a German company, hired to assess the dam, indicated in the most recent report last September that it was stable. The firm said it was monitoring all its other dams. A report by Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said therisk of collapse of the dam had been mentioned in a ""tense meeting"" that approved its licence,externallast month (in Portuguese). Roads have been destroyed by the sludge, complicating rescue efforts The environmental activist group Greenpeace said the dam break was ""a sad consequence of the lessons not learned by the Brazilian government and the mining companies."" It said the incidents ""are not accidents but environmental crimes that must be investigated, punished and repaired"". On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area. After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais with the Brazilian government.

"This video can not be played Samantha Smith said she was trying to remain positive A mum's lifesaving Â£250,000 neuro-surgery was put on hold after her bank generated a fraud alert when she tried to pay doctors. Samantha Smith had travelled from Rochdale to Arizona for the operation to rebuild her neck, which has been weakened by Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Ms Smith said Barclays blocked the transfer of funds despite being told in advance, causing the postponement. The bank said it had a duty of care to check unusual transactions. Ms Smith said she hoped the operation would be rescheduled shortly. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome has left tissue in Ms Smith's neck too weak to support her skull, putting pressure on her brain stem The 32-year-old was diagnosed with the rare connective tissue disorder in 2017. It has left mother-of-two Ms Smith's neck muscles too weak to hold her head upright without the use of a neck brace and caused pressure on her brain stem. The procedure to fuse the bones in her spine is not offered or funded by the NHS and Ms Smith had raised Â£250,000 through crowdfunding and events to travel to The Mayo Clinic for surgery. Barclays halted a transaction as she was attempting to pay pre-surgery costs for an operation on Friday. Ms Smith said she spent two and half hours on the phone to the bank Ms Smith said she hoped surgery at The Mayo Clinic in Arizona would be rescheduled soon Ms Smith spent two-and-a-half hours on the phone to the bank but the lifting of restrictions on her account came too late for the clinic, which had by then cancelled the operation. She said it had been ""rough"" to have the surgery ""taken away over money that we've got"" but was trying to stay positive for her children.

"Justice Secretary David Gauke has become the second cabinet minister to suggest Parliament could be given free votes on some Brexit-related issues. He told the BBC MPs should be able to vote according to their personal views when the next Brexit motion is debated on Tuesday, ""to resolve things"". Mr Gauke also reiterated he would consider his position if the government opted for a no deal EU withdrawal. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has adopted a similar stance. Shetold the BBC this week that she is ""committed to making sure we avoid""a no deal Brexit and would not rule out resigning over it. But she said allowing a free vote could help establish what Brexit solution could command a majority among MPs. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Mr Gauke - who like Ms Rudd backed Remain in the referendum - warned that the way the UK leaves the EU should not be ""railroaded through"" without Parliament giving consent. Asked whether he backed MPs being given a free vote - even if it potentially led to an extension of Article 50 - Mr Gauke said: ""I think there is a case for free votes in this area to resolve things. ""As far as Tuesday is concerned... we need to see what all the amendments are going to be, to see whether Tuesday is a crunch point or not."" On Tuesday, the House of Commons will see MPs vote on Mrs May's next steps for Brexit. Some groups of MPs have also tabled amendments to her motion to try and change the course of Brexit -including attemptsto stop a no-deal Brexit and to extend the deadline for leaving the EU. Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? EU may move on Brexit deal - Hammond A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Brexit: A really simple guide Meanwhile, Ireland's minister for European affairs Helen McEntee has said Ireland is not ""trying to be awkward"" in the row over the controversial backstop in the Brexit deal. The backstop is a last resort measure to ensure an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It would only be used if the UK and EU cannot agree a permanent trade deal by the time the Brexit transition period finishes at the end of 2020. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms McEntee said Mrs May's red lines on Brexit have made a backstop ""absolutely necessary"". She explained: ""The UK have said we're leaving the single market, we're leaving the customs union, and for us that makes it more difficult to avoid a border."" Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? The minister added: ""The onus by the UK has been shifted back on Ireland that we should compromise, that we are the ones that are trying to be awkward or difficult. ""We did not vote for Brexit. We don't believe in it. ""But we are protecting a peace process. There is an obligation on the UK to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is protected."" The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal if no agreement can be reached.

On 15 January, the withdrawal deal she negotiated with the EU was rejected by MPs by a historic margin - 432 votes to 202. Tuesday's vote will see MPs debate and vote on her next steps for Brexit. Opposition and backbench MPs have been tabling amendmentsto her motion in a bid to force the government to change direction. Theseinclude attemptsto stop a no deal Brexit and to extend the deadline for leaving the EU. On Friday, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said cabinet ministers should back the prime minister's stance of leaving the option of a no deal on the table. She alsosuggested the EU may be prepared to grant the UK a ""couple of extra weeks""beyond the 29 March deadline to finalise preparations for Brexit. However, Ms Leadsom said she had ""grave concerns"" about a bill, proposed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which could extend Article 50 - which triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU - by nine months. Ms Leadsom has ""grave concerns"" about a bill which could extend Article 50 Mr Gauke agreed with a suggestion that leaving without a deal could be ""pretty disastrous"" for the UK, saying it would have a ""significant impact"" on jobs. He said: ""If there is a conscious choice, 'Right, that's it, we're going no deal', that would be something I would find extremely difficult."" Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'?

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Nearly 300 people are missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. The break caused a sea of muddy sludge that buried the dam's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch on Friday. Rescue teams used earth-moving machinery at the site near the town of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state. State governor Romeu Zema said there was little chance of finding people alive. So far 11 people have been confirmed dead. It is not clear what caused the collapse of the dam, owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, President Jair Bolsonaro flew over the disaster area in a helicopter. He tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. Also on Saturday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama) issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Meanwhile a sum of 5bn reais has been frozen from Vale's accounts by a court to help fund recovery works and handle damage claims. The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what is consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers live, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed at the time of the accident. But Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the accident may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. The Globo website later reported that rescue officials provided the following breakdown on the number of the missing: Between 100 and 150 people in the administrative area close to the burst dam About 30 people in the Vila VÃ©rtico area About 35 people at Nova Estancia Inn Between 100 and 140 people in the Parque das Cachoeiras Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed. Many other residents have been evacuated as a safety measure. ""I'm anxious, I want news,"" 28-year-old Helton Pereira told the BBC as he waited outside a hospital in nearby Belo Horizonte - his 28-year-old wife and 35-year-old sister worked at the dam's cafeteria and were both missing. ""From now, the odds are minimal and it's most likely we'll recover only bodies,"" Governor Zema said. The dam is owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale Hopes are fading for survivors The powerful current swept everything in its way Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had capacity for 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. Mr Schvartsman called it a ""human tragedy"" and said a German company, hired to assess the dam, indicated in the most recent report last September that it was stable. The firm said it was monitoring all its other dams. A report by Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said therisk of collapse of the dam had been mentioned in a ""tense meeting"" that approved its licence,externallast month (in Portuguese). Roads have been destroyed by the sludge, complicating rescue efforts The environmental activist group Greenpeace said the dam break was ""a sad consequence of the lessons not learned by the Brazilian government and the mining companies."" It said the incidents ""are not accidents but environmental crimes that must be investigated, punished and repaired"". On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area. After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais with the Brazilian government.

"This video can not be played We have reached a deal - Trump President Donald Trump has yielded to political pressure to end the longest US government shutdown in history. After 35 days, he backed a deal to fund federal agencies for three weeks, but it includes none of the money he has demanded for a US-Mexico border wall. The Republican president previously vowed to reject any budget unless it included $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) to fund his signature campaign pledge. But Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, flatly refused. US shutdown: Reasons why Trump blinked Trump official mocked over shutdown remark US flight delays amid federal shutdown Later on Friday, the Senate and House unanimously passed a bill to temporarily end the shutdown, after which President Trump signed the bill into law. Following the votes in Congress, Mr Trump tweeted that his decision had been ""in no way a concession"", but was ""taking care of the millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown"".

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump said he was ""very proud to announce"" the agreement, which will fund the government until 15 February. He said federal workers affected by the political imbroglio, whom he called ""incredible patriots"", would receive full back-pay. 'A stinging defeat': US media on shutdown Mr Trump also said he would not yet resort to ""a very powerful alternative"" - an apparent reference to declaring a national emergency. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? This could divert military funding towards building a southern border wall, but such a proclamation would provoke constitutional uproar and legal challenges. However, the president added: ""We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. ""If we don't get a fair deal from Congress the government will either shut down on February 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the constitution of the United States to address this emergency."" Trump's border wall - in seven charts How the US shutdown is biting Mr Trump accepted the deal after hearing of the shutdown's strain on law enforcement agencies, an administration official told Reuters news agency. The president is prepared to haggle on the $5.7bn he has been demanding for the border barrier, the same official said. This video can not be played Boy sells art to help mother through shutdown For more than a month, Donald Trump insisted he would not support reopening the federal government without funding for his border wall. On Friday, as the fallout from the partial shutdown sent tremors through the US aviation system, the president backed down. Before all this began, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned the president that there was no clear way to win a shutdown standoff with Democrats, who - flush off their November election victories - wouldn't relent. The wily Kentucky senator, with more than a few legislative victories under his belt, was vindicated. That must be cold comfort for congressional Republicans, who have watched their party - and the president - take the brunt of the blame for the impasse. And it now sets up a three-week period of frenetic negotiations to reach a border security agreement. If the federal employees have been drowning because of the shutdown, this temporary funding agreement gives them a chance for a desperate gulp of air. In three weeks, another shutdown looms, however. Or, the president warned, he could declare a national emergency and take the border battle to the courts. Either way, the president has retreated - but the fight is far from over. Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi With opinion polls showing most Americans blamed Mr Trump for the shutdown, he opted for a way out that had been pushed for weeks by the Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The outcome was widely seen as a resounding victory for her. Lawmakers in her party lavished praise on the California congresswoman's refusal to give ground.

Some 800,000 civil servants missed another payday on Friday amid the five-week closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Earlier on Friday, hundreds of flights were grounded or delayed at US airports because of unpaid air traffic controllers calling in sick. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted arrivals for about an hour at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Flights were also delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport because of staff shortages, the FAA said. Meanwhile, thousands of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees failed to show up after they were ordered to return to work unpaid,the Washington Post reported,external. The Trump administration recalled 26,000 IRS workers this week to handle the looming tax filing season. But about 14,000 of them did not come back as of Tuesday, IRS officials told members of Congress. FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a video message to agents on Friday: ""I'm about as angry as I've been in a long, long time."" He said of the shutdown's effects on his agency: ""It's mind-boggling, it's short-sighted, and it's unfair.""

But the cash, raised via a GoFundMe page, has allowed the footballer's family to fund two boats, which started looking on Saturday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. A former Guernsey harbourmaster said the search was ""like looking for a needle in a haystack, when you don't even know where the haystack is"". Argentina's presidentMauricio Macri has joined calls by Sala's family for the search to resume. Footballers including Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan are among 2,448 people who have contributed to donations for the private search on a GoFundMe page.

""We're asking please don't stop with this effort,"" she said, during a visit to Cardiff. Among those joining calls for the search to continue areBarcelona forward Lionel Messi. Three planes and five helicopters racked up 80 hours combined flying time looking for the plane, working alongside two lifeboats and other passing ships. Cardiff City fans have been leaving floral tributes outside the team's stadium Guernsey's harbourmaster Captain David Barker has said the decision to call off the search was a ""difficult"" one, but the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"" and he was ""absolutely confident"" no more could have been done. Peter Gill, the island's former harbour master, said: ""It's like looking for a needle in a haystack when you don't even know where the haystack is. ""You don't know which road it's in, you don't know which parish it's in, you don't even know which county it's in."" He added that the sea off Alderney, where the plane lost contact, was anywhere between 50m (164ft) to 140m (460ft) deep, with currents measuring up to five knots (6mph). The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board ""It's very cold and it's also quite challenging in terms of currents and they are very, very seldom slack. The actual chance of getting down and finding something is very, very difficult indeed,"" he said. But diver Richard Keen, who often looks for shipwrecks in the Channel Islands said he thought there was a ""fairly good chance of finding the aircraft"". ""All other aircraft which have ditched around Guernsey were found very quickly by crab pot fishermen. When they're lifting their pots, they drag their pots across the seabed, they tangle in the aircraft,"" he said. ""There's about a 50% chance of finding it in the next three months."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans. The Piper PA-46 Malibu disappeared over the English Channel with Cardiff City's new signing and Mr Ibbotson on board.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) More than Â£220,000 has been raised to fund a private search for missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala. The official search for the Argentine striker, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59,was called off on Thursday. But the cash, raised via a GoFundMe page, has allowed the footballer's family to fund two boats, which started looking on Saturday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. A former Guernsey harbourmaster said the search was ""like looking for a needle in a haystack, when you don't even know where the haystack is"".

"Michel Legrand was known for his often jazz-tinged music French Oscar-winning composer and jazz pianist Michel Legrand has died in Paris aged 86, his spokesman has said. During a career spanning more than 50 years, Legrand wrote over 200 film and TV scores, as well as songs. In 1968, he won his first Oscar for the song The Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair film. Two more Oscars followed in 1971 and 1983 for the best original scores in Summer of '42 and Yentl films respectively. In the 1960s, he collaborated with French new wave director Jacques Demy on The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - the work which opened the door for Legrand to Hollywood. Michel Legrand was an accomplished jazz pianist The hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind was later covered by a number of artists including Dusty Springfield. Legrand - who was known for his often jazz-tinged music - collaborated with such stars as Miles Davies, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Edith Piaf among others. He had planned to give concerts in Paris in April, the AFP news agency reports. Legrand was born in Paris in 1932.

"This video can not be played Samantha Smith said she was trying to remain positive A mum's lifesaving Â£250,000 neuro-surgery was put on hold after her bank generated a fraud alert when she tried to pay doctors. Samantha Smith had travelled from Rochdale to Arizona for the operation to rebuild her neck, which has been weakened by Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Ms Smith said Barclays blocked the transfer of funds despite being told in advance, causing the postponement. The bank said it had a duty of care to check unusual transactions. Ms Smith said she hoped the operation would be rescheduled shortly. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome has left tissue in Ms Smith's neck too weak to support her skull, putting pressure on her brain stem The 32-year-old was diagnosed with the rare connective tissue disorder in 2017. It has left mother-of-two Ms Smith's neck muscles too weak to hold her head upright without the use of a neck brace and caused pressure on her brain stem. The procedure to fuse the bones in her spine is not offered or funded by the NHS and Ms Smith had raised Â£250,000 through crowdfunding and events to travel to The Mayo Clinic for surgery. Barclays halted a transaction as she was attempting to pay pre-surgery costs for an operation on Friday. Ms Smith said she spent two and half hours on the phone to the bank Ms Smith said she hoped surgery at The Mayo Clinic in Arizona would be rescheduled soon Ms Smith spent two-and-a-half hours on the phone to the bank but the lifting of restrictions on her account came too late for the clinic, which had by then cancelled the operation. She said it had been ""rough"" to have the surgery ""taken away over money that we've got"" but was trying to stay positive for her children. A bank spokesman said it had a duty of care to check unusual transactions with its customers. ""We have now established contact with the customer and are helping to resolve the matter so the payment can be processed as swiftly as possible,"" added the spokesman.

"Julen's parents JosÃ© and Victoria have experienced tragedy before Rescuers in Spain have found the body of a two-year-old boy who fell into a borehole near the southern city of MÃ¡laga, officials say. The boy, named Julen, disappeared into a narrow well more than 100m (330ft) deep during a family outing on 13 January. Specialist teams worked day and night in a tunnel that had been dug parallel to the narrow borehole. The body was found in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""At 01:25 (00:25 GMT), the rescue teams reached the area of the well where they were looking for Julen and they found the lifeless body of the little one,"" said Alfonso Rodriguez Gomez de Celis, the central government representative in the region of Andalusia. The accident happened during a Sunday afternoon excursion in a hilly plantation near the village of TotalÃ¡n. The borehole - only 25cm (10in) in diameter -  had apparently been left uncovered, although the businessman who had originally had it dug a month earlier insisted that he had sealed it. Such shafts are dug in the hope of extracting water. Rescuers had found hair among debris removed from the well and compared it with DNA samples from the boy's drinking bottle as well as from his family, confirming his identity. A camera sent down the hole found a snack bag believed to be the one Julen was holding when he fell. At 73m (240ft) the camera encountered an earth blockage in the shaft. Rescuers had not picked up any hopeful sign from the boy during the whole operation. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""All of Spain feels the infinite sadness of Julen's family."" ""We will always appreciate the tireless effort of those who searched for him during all these days."" By James Badcock, Madrid For almost two weeks a flicker of hope kept Spaniards and the country's media glued to the mountainside which had swallowed two-year-old Julen during a family picnic. Once rescue workers realised there was no safe way to break downwards through the plug of earth under which the toddler lay, meaning that another shaft would have to be made, logic dictated that the operation was more about recovering Julen's body than saving his life. But an unspoken pact banished any such statements while the combined team of Guardia Civil, firemen, mine rescue workers and others worked round the clock. Now a court in MÃ¡laga will attempt to determine the circumstances that saw Julen buried by rubble in a borehole that, according to local authorities, lacked the necessary permit - as do many thousands of others like it around the country. Julen's parents JosÃ© and Victoria have experienced tragedy before. Residents of El Palo, a nearby district, say the couple's three-year-old son, Oliver, died suddenly less than two years ago because of a heart problem. The borehole into which Julen fell is only 25cm (10in) in diameter Hair found in search for boy in well Desperate search for toddler in borehole New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"These cigarettes were seized in Durham Millions of fake cigarettes are entering the UK and undermining efforts to cut smoking, councils have warned. Herefordshire, Lincolnshire and Durham county councils in 2018 found illegal stashes of cigarettes behind shop walls, in sweet boxes and toilets. Fake or ""bootlegged"" tobacco products are sold on the black market to avoid paying duty, the Local Government Association (LGA) said. The illegal trade diverts Â£2.1bn a year in tax from HM Revenue and Customs. In one case, Peterborough man Karwan Salim Ahamed was sentenced last month after using fake Facebook profiles to sell illegal cigarettes on the social media site's ""Lincolnshire + Boston + Spalding + Skegness + Sleaford + Kirton + Heckington etc"" group. Mr Ahamed was ordered to do 200 hours community service and pay Â£5,000 in costs. The LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, is calling on the government to increase fines and penalties for those found guilty of trading in fake or tax-free cigarettes and tobacco. In another sentencing in Durham Crown Court last week, a 72-year-old man was ordered to pay a Â£35,000 fine after he tried to sell one box of 20 Brass cigarettes for Â£3.50 in a sting operation. He was caught with more than 100,000 illegal cigarettes. Stashes of illegal and fake cigarettes were found hidden behind shop walls In a separate case in Herefordshire, about 81,000 illegal cigarettes were seized from three shops in December. Officers uncovered remote controlled hydraulic hiding places, full of illegal tobacco, in the walls and floors of the shops. Trading standards officers have previously found illegal hauls hidden in toilet cisterns, in boxes of sweets, behind extractor fans and in ceiling lights. Fake or counterfeit cigarettes are made to look like well-known UK brands, but typically have foreign health advisories without picture warnings on the packaging. ""Non-duty paid"" or bootlegged cigarettes are UK brands usually brought into the country from abroad and sold illegally. Cigarettes and tobacco bought at duty-free shops are for personal use only. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: ""The sale of cheap, illegal tobacco by rogue traders in shops, private homes and through social media is funding organised criminal gangs and damaging legitimate traders, as well as making it easier for young people to get hooked on smoking, which undermines councils' efforts to help people quit. ""No cigarette is good for you, but fake cigarettes contain even higher levels of cancer-causing toxins than standard cigarettes, so people should think twice about buying them.""

"The coal tit has become a more regular sight across the UK Which birds do you see in your garden - and which no longer visit? For 40 years amateur birdwatchers have charted the dramatic changes in the Big Garden Birdwatch, run by conservation charity the RSPB. The wildlife survey, which began in 1979, has charted how birds such as the song thrush and greenfinch have been overtaken by the woodpigeon and long-tailed tit. As it returns this weekend, the RSPB has revealed the winners and the losers of the UK's changing bird population. Woodpigeon Change since 1979 = 950% The UK's largest and commonest pigeon can be shy in the countryside but is often tame and approachable in towns and cities. Woodpigeons are mostly grey with a white neck patch and white wing patches, which can be clearly seen when they are in flight. Its cooing call and the loud clatter of its wings when it flies away are familiar sounds in woodlands. What they eat: Crops like cabbages, sprouts, peas and grain. Also buds, shoots, seeds, nuts and berries. Collared dove Change since 1979 = 307% Collared doves only came to the UK in the 1950s, after a rapid spread across Europe from the Middle East. They are common visitors to gardens with the survey suggesting sightings have increased by more than 300% since 1979. Pinky-brown and grey in colour, these birds have a distinctive black neck collar and deep red eyes, while their monotonous cooing will be a sound familiar to many. What they eat: Seeds, grains, buds and shoots. Coal tit Change since 1979 = 263% Coal tits have a black cap and throat and white cheeks. They can often be found in parks, gardens and woodland, where a slim bill allows them to feed from conifers better than blue or great tits. A regular visitor to most feeders, they will take and store food for eating later. What they eat: Insects, seeds and nuts. Record figures in island bird-watch survey Lochaber osprey killed by power line Brotherly squawks help recapture parrot Magpie Change since 1979 = 173% ""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, Five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told,"" the saying goes. Known for their noisy chattering, distinctive black-and-white plumage and their scavenging. What they eat: Wild fruit, berries, grains, household scraps, carrion, small mammals and birds. Wren Change since 1979 = 88% A tiny, rotund brown bird with a fine bill and a narrow tail and a surprisingly loud voice. It is the most common UK breeding bird, although it suffers declines during prolonged, severely cold winters. Wrens are commonly found in gardens but are less likely to be seen in northern regions of the British Isles. Sightings of the bird dropped between 1999 and 2009 but their numbers have recovered in recent years. What they eat: Insects and spiders. Starling Change since 1979 = -80% Starlings are smaller than blackbirds, with a short tail, pointed head and triangular wings. They spend a lot of the year in flocks and often leave onlookers mesmerised as thousands of the birds move as one in displays known as murmurations. Despite this, starling numbers are a fraction of what they used to be. While huge flocks used to gather over large cities, nowadays they are more likely to be spotted in rural areas. Their decline is thought to be due to the loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farm chemicals and a shortage of food and nesting sites in many areas. What they eat: Invertebrates and fruit. Song thrush Change since 1979 = -75% A song thrush flicking its head to smash a snail against a stone or wall was a common sight in 1979. But their numbers have plummeted in recent decades. By 2009, its numbers were less than half those recorded in 1979, leaving it down at 20th in the rankings. The Big Garden Birdwatch helped alert the RSPB to the declining song thrush numbers. It's smaller and browner than a mistle thrush with smaller spotting. Its habit of repeating song phrases distinguish it from singing blackbirds. What they eat: Worms, snails and fruit. Greenfinch Change since 1979 = -57% A common countryside bird found in woods and hedges and another regular garden visitor. Greenfinch populations declined during the late 1970s and early 1980s but increased dramatically during the 1990s. A recent decline in numbers has been linked to an outbreak of trichomonosis, a parasite-induced disease which prevents the birds from feeding properly. What they eat: Seeds and insects House sparrow Change since 1979 = -57% These noisy birds are common all over the world but here in the UK their population fell continuously in every decade between 1979 and 2009. However, in recent years their numbers appear to have increased with data from the RSPB's Breeding Bird Survey suggesting numbers are on the rise in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. What they eat: Seeds and scraps. Chaffinch Change since 1979 = -55% The chaffinch is one of the most widespread and abundant birds in the British Isles. Its patterned plumage helps it to blend in when feeding on the ground and it becomes most obvious when it flies, revealing a flash of white on the wings and white outer tail feathers. It was the fourth most commonly spotted bird in the 1979 survey but has since slipped to 10th place. It's thought their numbers could also have been affected by finch trichomonosis. What they eat: Insects and seeds. The Big Garden Birdwatch takes place on 26 - 28 January. Choose a good spot. This could be your back garden, a local park, or any green space. The RSPB advises grabbing a hot drink and some snacks and getting ready to count Watch the birds and other wildlife for one hour. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. There's a counting tool on the RSPB website to help keep track of your sightings If you're not sure what you've just seen, you can find out using their identification tool Only count the maximum number of each species you see at any one time. So if you see three blue tits, but later two, and then another one, the number to submit is three. That way, you avoid counting the same bird twice. Go to theBig Garden Birdwatch page,externaland tell the RSPB what you've seen.

"The new host of The Rap Show on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra says she ""won't tolerate disrespectful lyrics towards women at all"" on her show. Tiffany Calver became the first woman to host the Saturday night 9-11pm slot when she took over from Charlie Sloth at the beginning of January. A few weeks in, Tiffany ""still can't believe"" she's landed her dream job - and says she ""understands"" what it means to be The Rap Show's first female host. ""As with any genre - it's not just within hip-hop - there will always be things that you personally can find problematic. ""I definitely have my own beliefs and there are people that I definitely have already blacklisted from my tracklists purely based on how they have treated women in the news and in the press,"" she says. But Tiffany also says it shouldn't just be the job of women to comment on misogynistic lyrics. ""It should be everyone. You know where the line is. I'm just putting my foot down and strongly vocalising that I won't tolerate disrespectful lyrics towards women at all."" Tiffany follows in the footsteps of Tim Westwood and Charlie Sloth in hosting The Rap Show Tiffany's first three shows, which have featured appearances from rising UK rapper Headie One and US titan Future, have been well received by the audience. And a lot of work has gone into them. ""It's what I've always wanted to do - so I'm almost happy about the fact that I'm here all the time preparing for the show."" Around her is a predominantly female production team, as well as a female editor and commissioner, which Tiffany says is important, then decides it isn't, before settling on the decision that it is. ""It's important because I think nobody would think it,"" she says. ""For one, you would never presume the biggest rap show in the country is hosted by a female. ""There's a female producer, I have a gay producer - it's like all of these people that would never necessarily have been tied to a specific genre maybe 10, 20 years ago, are running the biggest show in the country. ""It just shows how far we as people but also as a culture are coming, that this is accepted."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Tiffany has taken over The Rap Show - previously hosted by Tim Westwood and Charlie Sloth - at a good time for UK rap. Top 10 records used to feel out of reach for British rappers but now, as Tiffany says, ""basically anything Dave touches gets in the top 10"". And she thinks the scene can ""only keep building"". ""We never had an infrastructure like we do now, back then. ""People are really buying into black music - rap music, UK rap - the money in it is completely different.

In 1968, he won his first Oscar for the song The Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair film. Two more Oscars followed in 1971 and 1983 for the best original scores in Summer of '42 and Yentl films respectively. In the 1960s, he collaborated with French new wave director Jacques Demy on The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - the work which opened the door for Legrand to Hollywood. Michel Legrand was an accomplished jazz pianist The hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind was later covered by a number of artists including Dusty Springfield. Legrand - who was known for his often jazz-tinged music - collaborated with such stars as Miles Davies, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Edith Piaf among others. He had planned to give concerts in Paris in April, the AFP news agency reports. Legrand was born in Paris in 1932.

"The young actors in a publicity shot for the film A film recreating events around the notorious murder of two-year-old James Bulger will be allowed to compete at the Oscars, the awards' organisers say. James' mother had called for Detainment to be withdrawn, after it was nominated in the best live action short category.

"Electricity supplies to Our Power customers are ""secure"" Edinburgh-based Our Power, which has 38,000 customers, has gone out of business. Its website said the interests of customers would be protected and power supplies were ""secure"". The jobs of 70 members of staff at the not-for-profit company are at risk. An administrator is expected to be appointed on 31 January. The Scottish government is thought to have lost nearly Â£10m in loans to the failed energy supplier. The firm was set up four years ago with thehigh-profile support of Scottish ministers. By buying energy at wholesale rates for housing association tenants, it was expected to save them money and reduce fuel poverty. The government agreed to three commercial rate loans, totalling Â£9.5m, alongside social investors and after making checks into the business plans. In a letter to customers, the company's CEO, Dawn Muspratt, blamed the company's collapse on several factors. The firm was forced to implement a new billing system in 2018 after their system was withdrawn from the market. This resulted in bills being issued late and cashflow issues. Volatile wholesale gas and electricity markets meant a lot of cash was taken out of the business. And changes to the energy industry, including regulated price caps, made it difficult to grow the customer base. Our Power joins a long list of small providers that have gone bust recently, includingEconomy Energy,Spark Energy,Extra Energy,Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select and Usio Energy. The regulator Ofgem said it would choose a new supplier to take on the customers ""as quickly as possible"". It said repayment meters can be topped up as normal and the outstanding credit balances of domestic customers would be honoured. A statement to customers has been posted on the company's website Ofgem director for future retail markets Philippa Pickford said: ""Our message to energy customers with Our Power is there is no need to worry, as under our safety net we will make sure your energy supplies are secure and your credit balance is protected. ""Ofgem will now choose a new supplier for you, ensuring you get the best deal possible. ""Whilst we're doing this, our advice is to 'sit tight' and don't switch. You can rely on your energy supply as normal."" She added: ""We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff."" The Scottish government said it was disappointed to learn the company had ceased trading. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ""The Scottish government has supported Our Power in its aim of tackling fuel poverty since 2015. ""This will be a worrying time for all the employees"" She added that support for staff would be available through the government's Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace) scheme.

"Julen's parents JosÃ© and Victoria have experienced tragedy before Rescuers in Spain have found the body of a two-year-old boy who fell into a borehole near the southern city of MÃ¡laga, officials say. The boy, named Julen, disappeared into a narrow well more than 100m (330ft) deep during a family outing on 13 January. Specialist teams worked day and night in a tunnel that had been dug parallel to the narrow borehole. The body was found in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""At 01:25 (00:25 GMT), the rescue teams reached the area of the well where they were looking for Julen and they found the lifeless body of the little one,"" said Alfonso Rodriguez Gomez de Celis, the central government representative in the region of Andalusia. The accident happened during a Sunday afternoon excursion in a hilly plantation near the village of TotalÃ¡n. The borehole - only 25cm (10in) in diameter -  had apparently been left uncovered, although the businessman who had originally had it dug a month earlier insisted that he had sealed it. Such shafts are dug in the hope of extracting water. Rescuers had found hair among debris removed from the well and compared it with DNA samples from the boy's drinking bottle as well as from his family, confirming his identity. A camera sent down the hole found a snack bag believed to be the one Julen was holding when he fell. At 73m (240ft) the camera encountered an earth blockage in the shaft. Rescuers had not picked up any hopeful sign from the boy during the whole operation. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""All of Spain feels the infinite sadness of Julen's family."" ""We will always appreciate the tireless effort of those who searched for him during all these days."" By James Badcock, Madrid For almost two weeks a flicker of hope kept Spaniards and the country's media glued to the mountainside which had swallowed two-year-old Julen during a family picnic. Once rescue workers realised there was no safe way to break downwards through the plug of earth under which the toddler lay, meaning that another shaft would have to be made, logic dictated that the operation was more about recovering Julen's body than saving his life. But an unspoken pact banished any such statements while the combined team of Guardia Civil, firemen, mine rescue workers and others worked round the clock. Now a court in MÃ¡laga will attempt to determine the circumstances that saw Julen buried by rubble in a borehole that, according to local authorities, lacked the necessary permit - as do many thousands of others like it around the country. Julen's parents JosÃ© and Victoria have experienced tragedy before. Residents of El Palo, a nearby district, say the couple's three-year-old son, Oliver, died suddenly less than two years ago because of a heart problem.

"Jim Sheridan said he was ""humbled"" by the support he has received A former Labour MP suspended from the party over comments made online about the Jewish community has been reinstated following an investigation. Jim Sheridan, who is now a councillor in Renfrewshire, said he was ""delighted"" with the decision. The partylaunched an investigationfollowing a complaint last August. It was reported to relate to a social media post in which he spoke about his loss of ""respect and empathy"" for the community amid the anti-Semitism row. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism row At the timeLabour leader Jeremy Corbynsaid the comments were ""completely unacceptable"". In a statement issued on Friday, Mr Sheridan, a former Paisley and Renfrewshire North MP, reiterated his apology to the Jewish community, while calling his accusers ""misguided"". He said: ""Today I was notified that my suspension from the Labour Party has been lifted with no further action to be taken by the party. ""Whilst I am delighted with this decision, I remain of the view that my accusers were misguided and overreacted to what was intended to highlight my personal frustration and criticism of those intent on undermining our leadership in Scotland and the UK. ""I would also like to reiterate my sincere apologies to the Jewish community whose historic struggle I have supported all my political life."" Mr Sheridan said he had been ""humbled"" by the level of support he received. He added: ""Throughout this unfortunate distraction I have maintained my total commitment to my constituents and will continue to do so. ""Likewise my complete support for the Labour Party and our leaderships at every level continues, and reinforces my determination to return Labour administrations at local, devolved and national level, for the many, not the few."" It is understood Mr Sheridan will be issued with a reminder of party conduct. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.

"This video can not be played We have reached a deal - Trump President Donald Trump has yielded to political pressure to end the longest US government shutdown in history. After 35 days, he backed a deal to fund federal agencies for three weeks, but it includes none of the money he has demanded for a US-Mexico border wall. The Republican president previously vowed to reject any budget unless it included $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) to fund his signature campaign pledge. But Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, flatly refused. US shutdown: Reasons why Trump blinked Trump official mocked over shutdown remark US flight delays amid federal shutdown Later on Friday, the Senate and House unanimously passed a bill to temporarily end the shutdown, after which President Trump signed the bill into law. Following the votes in Congress, Mr Trump tweeted that his decision had been ""in no way a concession"", but was ""taking care of the millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown"".

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump said he was ""very proud to announce"" the agreement, which will fund the government until 15 February. He said federal workers affected by the political imbroglio, whom he called ""incredible patriots"", would receive full back-pay. 'A stinging defeat': US media on shutdown Mr Trump also said he would not yet resort to ""a very powerful alternative"" - an apparent reference to declaring a national emergency. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? This could divert military funding towards building a southern border wall, but such a proclamation would provoke constitutional uproar and legal challenges. However, the president added: ""We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. ""If we don't get a fair deal from Congress the government will either shut down on February 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the constitution of the United States to address this emergency."" Trump's border wall - in seven charts How the US shutdown is biting Mr Trump accepted the deal after hearing of the shutdown's strain on law enforcement agencies, an administration official told Reuters news agency. The president is prepared to haggle on the $5.7bn he has been demanding for the border barrier, the same official said. This video can not be played Boy sells art to help mother through shutdown For more than a month, Donald Trump insisted he would not support reopening the federal government without funding for his border wall. On Friday, as the fallout from the partial shutdown sent tremors through the US aviation system, the president backed down. Before all this began, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned the president that there was no clear way to win a shutdown standoff with Democrats, who - flush off their November election victories - wouldn't relent. The wily Kentucky senator, with more than a few legislative victories under his belt, was vindicated. That must be cold comfort for congressional Republicans, who have watched their party - and the president - take the brunt of the blame for the impasse. And it now sets up a three-week period of frenetic negotiations to reach a border security agreement. If the federal employees have been drowning because of the shutdown, this temporary funding agreement gives them a chance for a desperate gulp of air. In three weeks, another shutdown looms, however. Or, the president warned, he could declare a national emergency and take the border battle to the courts. Either way, the president has retreated - but the fight is far from over. Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi With opinion polls showing most Americans blamed Mr Trump for the shutdown, he opted for a way out that had been pushed for weeks by the Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The outcome was widely seen as a resounding victory for her. Lawmakers in her party lavished praise on the California congresswoman's refusal to give ground.

Some 800,000 civil servants missed another payday on Friday amid the five-week closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Earlier on Friday, hundreds of flights were grounded or delayed at US airports because of unpaid air traffic controllers calling in sick. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted arrivals for about an hour at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Flights were also delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport because of staff shortages, the FAA said. Meanwhile, thousands of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees failed to show up after they were ordered to return to work unpaid,the Washington Post reported,external. The Trump administration recalled 26,000 IRS workers this week to handle the looming tax filing season. But about 14,000 of them did not come back as of Tuesday, IRS officials told members of Congress. FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a video message to agents on Friday: ""I'm about as angry as I've been in a long, long time."" He said of the shutdown's effects on his agency: ""It's mind-boggling, it's short-sighted, and it's unfair.""

"This video can not be played Stunning visuals of the world's tallest statue Indian officials have begun relocating some 300 crocodiles from a reservoir next to the world's tallest statue to allow a seaplane service for visitors. The animals, some around 3m (9ft 9in) long, are being lured into metal cages and sent elsewhere in the western state of Gujarat. But conservationists have criticised the plan. The 182m statue of independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was inaugurated last October. The bronze-clad statue sculpture, located some 200km (125 miles) from the state's main city of Ahmedabad, has become a popular attraction. Indian farmers fume at cost of statue In pictures: Statue's construction But there are no train services and most tourists reach the site, known as ""Statue of Unity"", by bus. The statue is nearly twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty in New York Local forestry official Anuradha Sahu said the instruction had come from the state government ""for safety reasons as the tourist influx has increased"", AFP news agency reports. So far about a dozen crocodiles have been removed and transported on the back of pick-up trucks. Community Science Centre Director Jitendra Gavali said the decision to remove the crocodiles was a violation of the country's wildlife protection legislation. ""The government is disturbing their habitat and putting their lives at risk,"",externalDr Gavali was quoted by the Times of India as saying. ""Also, the government hasn't thought out where it will release the captured crocodiles safely."" Bittu Sahgal, editor of the wildlife magazine Sanctuary Asia, was another critic of the plan.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who, like Patel, was born in Gujarat - commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010. In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy. The statue cost 29.9bn rupees (Â£330m; $430m). Born in Gujarat, Mr Patel was a deputy to India's prime minister after India's independence in 1947 The nationalist was known as the ""Iron Man of India"" after he persuaded feuding states to unite and become part of the Indian state after independence Many Hindu nationalists feel his place in history was overlooked in favour of the Nehru dynasty, which came to dominate Indian politics The statue is nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty and has a viewing gallery some 153m up, near its chest Read more:The battle over the legacy of India's 'Iron Man' World's tallest statue angers Indian farmers The battle over the legacy of India's 'Iron Man' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has rejected an offer of talks from President NicolÃ¡s Maduro amid an ongoing power struggle between the two. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday, a move that has been recognised by several countries, including the US. But Mr Maduro accused him of mounting a coup and cut off diplomatic ties with the US in response. A UN Security Council meeting on the crisis is due to be held on Saturday. President Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after polls marred by an opposition boycott and vote-rigging claims. However, the National Assembly argued that the post of president was vacant because the election was not fair, and that Mr GuaidÃ³, as head of the National Assembly, should take over as acting president. Tens of thousands have taken part in anti-Maduro protests, angry at years of economic freefall. What is happening in Venezuela? What might happen next? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Are you in Venezuela? Email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk The international community is split on whether to recognise Mr Maduro's government. On Friday, Mr Maduro said he was ready to talk to his rival - but Mr GuaidÃ³ said he rejected ""fake dialogue"" and said he would consider offering him amnesty. At a rally in east Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ urged his supporters to keep protesting if, as some fear, he gets arrested. Mr Maduro has so far retained the support of the country's military, but Mr GuaidÃ³ has asked them to ""put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people"" and back him instead. He has also called for major demonstrations demanding Mr Maduro's resignation to be held next week. Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials has hit its population hard and caused millions to flee. Mr Maduro has faced internal opposition and ongoing international criticism for his human rights record and handling of the economy. This video can not be played Thousands attended a rally in Caracas on Wednesday against President Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ said on Wednesday that the country's constitution allows him to take power because Mr Maduro's presidency is illegitimate. He has promised to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, Canada and the UK have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ after he said he was the legitimate president. France, Germany and Spain say they will recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections are not called within eight days. On Saturday, the US is expected to demand a UN Security Council statement recognising Venezuela's National Assembly as the country's ""only democratically elected institution"", Reuters reports. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday However Russia - a UN Security Council member - has condemned foreign support for Mr GuaidÃ³, saying it violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"". On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denounced US policy toward Mr Maduro as ""destructive"". According to Reuters,Russian military contractors have been flown secretly into the country to provide security for the president,external. China, Mexico and Turkey have also publicly backed Mr Maduro. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has appointed a veteran former diplomat as his envoy to deal with the crisis in Venezuela. He said Elliott Abrams would be responsible for all US efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela.

"This video can not be played Roger Stone exited court flashing a Nixonian double-V sign Political strategist Roger Stone, a long-time ally of President Trump, has been arrested in Florida, charged with seven counts in the Mueller probe. Mr Stone, 66, appeared in court in the city of Fort Lauderdale. The indictment includes,externalone count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness-tampering. The charges are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. CNN reports that FBI agents arrested Mr Stone in a pre-dawn raid on Friday. One pounded on the door and said, ""FBI, open the door,"" the US cable network says. After news of his old friend's arrest, President Donald Trump slammed the Russia investigation once again on Twitter, calling it the ""Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!""

Mr Stone appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale The special counsel has accused Mr Stone of attempting to obstruct the investigation into Russian meddling by: Lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what transpired between him and Wikileaks Lying to the committee about records of his interactions with Wikileaks Witness tampering, for trying to keep his Wikileaks intermediary from telling the truth to Congress The indictment does not say Mr Stone committed any criminal activity during the election. He was released on a $250,000 (Â£189,000) bond, but with restrictions allowing him to travel only for court appearances in Florida, Washington DC and New York. After his court appearance, Mr Stone spoke on the phone to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his radio programme Infowars. ""I intend to fight for my life,"" Mr Stone said as he launched a fundraiser for his legal battle. ""There's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges. ""There's no circumstance under which I would bear false witness to the president."" He added: ""Once again, there is no evidence of Russian collusion, Wikileaks collaboration and I'm not charged with doing anything inappropriate or illegal to assist in his [Mr Trump's] election."" Protesters outside chanted ""lock him up"" as Mr Stone exited the courtroom Mr Stone then emerged from court grinning broadly while flashing a Nixonian double V-sign and wearing a blue Ralph Lauren polo shirt. He maintained his innocence though was at times inaudible because of loud boos and chants of ""Lock him up!"" Mr Stone said he would formally plead not guilty to the charges in a Washington DC court next week. He declared himself the target of ""a politically motivated investigation"" and criticised the manner of his arrest. ""At the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with lights flashing. They terrorised my wife [and] my dogs."" This video can not be played Roger Stone was arrested at home in Fort Lauderdale Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who was targeted in the email hack, accused Mr Stone of knowing about it beforehand. More than a month before the emails were made public, Mr Stone tweeted it would soon be Mr Podesta's ""time in a barrel"", which critics say indicates he already knew about the hack. Mr Stone has denied having advance knowledge of the cyber-breach and any knowing contact with Russian agents. On Friday, Mr Podestareferenced the cryptic tweet in a post,externalabout Mr Stone's indictment, noting it was ""Roger's time in the barrel"". Roger Stone is a political lobbyist and an ally of President Donald Trump According to investigators, Mr Stone said he had ""communicated"" with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange before the emails' release and had described the contact as ""perfectly legal"". The indictment accuses the lobbyist of lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what passed between him and Wikileaks, and of falsely claiming not to have records of it. Mr Stone is said to have spoken to senior Trump campaign officials - who are not identified - about ""organization 1"" [believed to be Wikileaks] ""and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign"". Prosecutors say Mr Stone was also contacted by unnamed ""senior Trump campaign officials"" to inquire about future Wikileaks releases. They also allege he made false statements about his communications with conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi regarding the Wikileaks email leak. The indictment points to conversations about the planned Wikileaks release to the public between Mr Stone and ""Person 1"" and ""Person 2"", who are not identified by name. Lawyers for Mr Corsi confirmed he is ""Person 1"" in the indictment on Friday, adding that they believe he is not accused of any wrongdoing in the Mueller investigation. Mr Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s His campaign activities have long been under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had tried to turn the election in Mr Trump's favour through state-sponsored cyber-attacks and fake news stories spread on social media. The Mueller investigation has also focused on Mr Stone's communications with Twitter persona Guccifer 2.0, which US intelligence officials say is a front for Russian military intelligence. Mr Trump has repeatedly assailed the Mueller inquiry. The Kremlin has always denied meddling in the US election. Who is Trump confidant Roger Stone? All you need to know about Trump Russia story The president's counsel, Jay Sekulow, said: ""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress"". Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused the Trump campaign of being ""a willing and active participant in a conspiracy with Russia and Wikileaks"" in a statement. Mr Perez added that ""there are more conspirators yet to be held accountable - and at least one of them is named Donald Trump"". Mr Stone has repeatedly said in interviews that he expected to be indicted. In May he told NBC's Meet the Press: ""It is not inconceivable now that Mr Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business, or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election."" Through past indictments Robert Mueller has been building the case that Russians were behind the hacking of senior Democratic and Hillary Clinton campaign officials. He alleges they then used Wikileaks to inject damaging information they garnered into the US political bloodstream at a time most harmful to Democrats. What the special counsel's office had yet to allege is that there were any ties between Wikileaks and the Donald Trump presidential campaign. On Friday Mr Mueller charged long-time Trump adviser and confidant Roger Stone with being that missing link, citing communications between Mr Stone and ""senior"" Trump campaign officials before and after the Wikileaks documents were released. The move marks a significant development in this nearly two-year legal drama. For the first time a member of Mr Trump's inner circle, albeit an informal one, is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling - the central thrust of the special counsel's investigation. Mr Stone has denied suggestions of criminal misconduct. But the man who has boasted of being a master of the political dark arts, and who seemed to crave the notoriety that went along with such claims, now finds himself directly in the centre of a withering legal spotlight. Mr Stone is the 34th person to be charged as part of the Mueller investigation. Those indicted include 12 Russian military officers and 13 Russian nationals accused of leading a campaign to interfere in the US election. Another three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency ""troll farm"", have also been charged. Mueller disputes Buzzfeed's Trump report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Several people connected directly with Mr Trump have been indicted, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Paul Manafort, the former chairman of his election campaign, who is in jail. Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have also been charged. An old friend of Donald Trump, Roger Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s. A self-proclaimed Republican ""dirty trickster"", he favours three-piece suits and reportedly does not wear socks.

Mr Stone became embroiled in the Watergate scandal after congressional hearings revealed that he hired an operative to infiltrate the campaign of George McGovern, Mr Nixon's Democratic opponent. He went on to work for Ronald Reagan's successful presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984, and advised George HW Bush in his bid for the White House in 1988.

"Ms McPherson said she had been accused of doing something ""not even a dog would do"" A Mexican woman who miscarried in a department store toilet has been freed after three years in prison. Dafne McPherson, 29, was sentenced to 16 years after being found guilty of murdering her newborn baby. Prosecutors accused her of inducing early birth and drowning the baby, but an appeal found the scientific evidence used against her was unreliable. Abortions were decriminalised in Mexico City in 2007 but are still banned in most Mexican states. ""The only thing I can say to other women who are in my situation is never lose hope,"" Ms McPherson told reporters after leaving jail in central Mexico. ""They didn't do a thing,"" she said of the investigation. ""That's why there are people inside who shouldn't be in prison.""

In her latest appeal, Ms McPherson's lawyers provided evidence that the baby's death was caused by inadequate facilities and a lack of medical attention. Security staff had prevented a Red Cross ambulance from accessing the store's parking lot, calling for a private ambulance instead. They also submitted evidence that, a year earlier, Ms McPherson was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The disease causes symptoms similar to pregnancy including weight gain, irregular menstruation and fatigue.

"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala's sister made an emotional plea for the search for her brother to resume Argentina's president has joined calls for the search for missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala to resume. Mauricio Macri told his foreign minister to issue formal requests to Britain and France, according to a statement from his office. The search for the Argentine striker, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59,was called off on Thursday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. In a statement, the president's office said: ""President Mauricio Macri instructed foreign minister Jorge Faurie to make a formal request to the governments of Great Britain and France to ask them to maintain the search efforts."" Mr Faurie is expected to make the request to both nations' embassies. Earlier, Sala's sister Romina said: ""We are convinced Emiliano and the pilot are alive somewhere in the channel."" Speaking through an interpreter, Ms Sala added: ""I'm still in shock. We know Emiliano and the pilot are still alive. We want to go and search for them. ""We're asking please don't stop with this effort. All together, we will find a way to restart the search to find Emiliano."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board the plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper PA-46 Malibu disappeared over the English Channel with Cardiff City's new signing and Mr Ibbotson on board. A ""moment of silent reflection"" for the pair will take place at the next round of Premier League fixtures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Footballers call for Sala search to resume Transfer window extension request over missing player denied Cardiff to honour Sala with daffodils Timeline of Cardiff City signing from Nantes Mr Ibbotson of Crowle, Lincolnshire, held a private pilot's licence and passed a medical exam as recently as November, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. The Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft was registered in the US, so fell under its regulations. US law states private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturdayand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared Guernsey's harbour master explained a ""difficult"" decision was made to call off the search on Thursday, saying the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". Captain David Barker acknowledged the family were ""not content"" with the decision, but was ""absolutely confident"" no more could have been done. He insisted UK coastguard protocols were followed and hoped the families found some comfort in the incident remaining open, despite searches ceasing. A petition launched in Franceto have the search resumed,externalhas gathered more than 67,000 signatures. Sala's former club Nantes, along with many of its players, backed Ms Sala's calls, saying: ""FC Nantes learned searches for the missing plane have been called off. These cannot stop."" Tributes have been left outside the Cardiff City Stadium Barcelona star Lionel Messi - a fellow Argentine -posted a message of support for his compatriot on Instagram,external. Three planes and five helicopters racked up 80 hours combined flying time looking for the plane, working alongside two lifeboats and other passing ships. Ms Sala said she held a meeting with investigators, but could not comment about it, and said the family were grateful for all the support they had received. Cardiff City's owner Vincent Tan said: ""Monday evening's news shook everyone at Cardiff City FC to the core. ""We also thank everyone involved with the search and rescue operation, and continue to pray for Emiliano, David Ibbotson and their families."" Chief executive Ken Choo praised Sala as a ""humble man"", adding: ""He's willing to fight and join us [Cardiff City] and help us, so I view him as a hero."" He said the club would provide information to the family, but added: ""With a missing plane, there is a lot of information to acquire - it could take up to six months to a year."" The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board There were ""alarm bells all around"" the incident, aviation consultant Alastair Rosenchein told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme. He said: ""The one issue is whether a single-engine air craft should be flying at night, in winter, over water and with passengers. This is the real issue - it is a really bad combination."" He said despite only 1,400 of the planes being built, there was a ""quite significant"" number of deaths and injuries from flights involving them.

"The coal tit has become a more regular sight across the UK Which birds do you see in your garden - and which no longer visit? For 40 years amateur birdwatchers have charted the dramatic changes in the Big Garden Birdwatch, run by conservation charity the RSPB. The wildlife survey, which began in 1979, has charted how birds such as the song thrush and greenfinch have been overtaken by the woodpigeon and long-tailed tit. As it returns this weekend, the RSPB has revealed the winners and the losers of the UK's changing bird population. Woodpigeon Change since 1979 = 950% The UK's largest and commonest pigeon can be shy in the countryside but is often tame and approachable in towns and cities. Woodpigeons are mostly grey with a white neck patch and white wing patches, which can be clearly seen when they are in flight. Its cooing call and the loud clatter of its wings when it flies away are familiar sounds in woodlands. What they eat: Crops like cabbages, sprouts, peas and grain. Also buds, shoots, seeds, nuts and berries. Collared dove Change since 1979 = 307% Collared doves only came to the UK in the 1950s, after a rapid spread across Europe from the Middle East. They are common visitors to gardens with the survey suggesting sightings have increased by more than 300% since 1979. Pinky-brown and grey in colour, these birds have a distinctive black neck collar and deep red eyes, while their monotonous cooing will be a sound familiar to many. What they eat: Seeds, grains, buds and shoots. Coal tit Change since 1979 = 263% Coal tits have a black cap and throat and white cheeks. They can often be found in parks, gardens and woodland, where a slim bill allows them to feed from conifers better than blue or great tits. A regular visitor to most feeders, they will take and store food for eating later. What they eat: Insects, seeds and nuts. Record figures in island bird-watch survey Lochaber osprey killed by power line Brotherly squawks help recapture parrot Magpie Change since 1979 = 173% ""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, Five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told,"" the saying goes. Known for their noisy chattering, distinctive black-and-white plumage and their scavenging. What they eat: Wild fruit, berries, grains, household scraps, carrion, small mammals and birds. Wren Change since 1979 = 88% A tiny, rotund brown bird with a fine bill and a narrow tail and a surprisingly loud voice. It is the most common UK breeding bird, although it suffers declines during prolonged, severely cold winters. Wrens are commonly found in gardens but are less likely to be seen in northern regions of the British Isles. Sightings of the bird dropped between 1999 and 2009 but their numbers have recovered in recent years. What they eat: Insects and spiders. Starling Change since 1979 = -80% Starlings are smaller than blackbirds, with a short tail, pointed head and triangular wings. They spend a lot of the year in flocks and often leave onlookers mesmerised as thousands of the birds move as one in displays known as murmurations. Despite this, starling numbers are a fraction of what they used to be. While huge flocks used to gather over large cities, nowadays they are more likely to be spotted in rural areas. Their decline is thought to be due to the loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farm chemicals and a shortage of food and nesting sites in many areas. What they eat: Invertebrates and fruit. Song thrush Change since 1979 = -75% A song thrush flicking its head to smash a snail against a stone or wall was a common sight in 1979. But their numbers have plummeted in recent decades. By 2009, its numbers were less than half those recorded in 1979, leaving it down at 20th in the rankings. The Big Garden Birdwatch helped alert the RSPB to the declining song thrush numbers. It's smaller and browner than a mistle thrush with smaller spotting. Its habit of repeating song phrases distinguish it from singing blackbirds. What they eat: Worms, snails and fruit. Greenfinch Change since 1979 = -57% A common countryside bird found in woods and hedges and another regular garden visitor. Greenfinch populations declined during the late 1970s and early 1980s but increased dramatically during the 1990s. A recent decline in numbers has been linked to an outbreak of trichomonosis, a parasite-induced disease which prevents the birds from feeding properly. What they eat: Seeds and insects House sparrow Change since 1979 = -57% These noisy birds are common all over the world but here in the UK their population fell continuously in every decade between 1979 and 2009. However, in recent years their numbers appear to have increased with data from the RSPB's Breeding Bird Survey suggesting numbers are on the rise in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. What they eat: Seeds and scraps. Chaffinch Change since 1979 = -55% The chaffinch is one of the most widespread and abundant birds in the British Isles. Its patterned plumage helps it to blend in when feeding on the ground and it becomes most obvious when it flies, revealing a flash of white on the wings and white outer tail feathers. It was the fourth most commonly spotted bird in the 1979 survey but has since slipped to 10th place. It's thought their numbers could also have been affected by finch trichomonosis. What they eat: Insects and seeds. The Big Garden Birdwatch takes place on 26 - 28 January. Choose a good spot. This could be your back garden, a local park, or any green space. The RSPB advises grabbing a hot drink and some snacks and getting ready to count Watch the birds and other wildlife for one hour. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. There's a counting tool on the RSPB website to help keep track of your sightings If you're not sure what you've just seen, you can find out using their identification tool Only count the maximum number of each species you see at any one time. So if you see three blue tits, but later two, and then another one, the number to submit is three. That way, you avoid counting the same bird twice. Go to theBig Garden Birdwatch page,externaland tell the RSPB what you've seen.

"In the age of #MeToo, a single woman sitting alone in a restaurant shouldn't be a problem. Especially, you would think, if that restaurant is in the middle of New York, one of the most progressive cities on the planet. So when Clementine Crawford was reportedly told she could no longer sit at the bar of her favourite Manhattan restaurant, she was confused. As she wrote later, she was even more confused when a man, arriving not long after she had been sat at a table, was allowed to take a seat at that very same bar. It was only, she says, when she pushed for a reason, that she was told ""the owner had ordered a crackdown on hookers"". Her years of regular dinners, and her high-flying job, appeared to mean nothing. The implication for all single women was clear. 'He was a butcher': The women fighting abuse in childbirth The 'wary' #MeToo conversation in Australia Is India's film industry having its #MeToo moment? Incensed, Clementine, who divides her time between London and New York for her job with Finch & Partners, pushed for her right to sit at the bar, alongside her single male counterparts. But instead of a grovelling apology, her arguments were met with a shrug. She left the restaurant - a place she had loved, a place where the waiters had known her name, and now a place she no longer felt welcome. Clementine sums it up inan article she wrote about the experience for DrugstoreCulture.com,external. ""All these years we have been battling for a room of one's own,"" she wrote. ""Little did we know it, but we are still fighting for a seat at the table (or bar, to be strictly accurate)."" Clementine Crawford, pictured here with TV personality Colin Cowie, is a senior executive with Finch & Partners Eating alone as a single woman is - for many - a daunting process. The protective barrier of a book or, more recently, a phone, makes it easier. Somehow you feel less exposed, less vulnerable. But ask around, and no one can quite put their finger on why they felt vulnerable in the first place. Certainly experiences like Clementine's - where the assumptions of staff or other diners is articulated quite so blatantly - appear few and far between. But, Clementine tells the BBC, it may be more common than we think. ""Since the article was published a number of women - including women who live in modern-day Manhattan - have declared they experience similar treatment in a number of different settings and are relieved that a voice has been given to the '#smallstuff',"" she told the BBC. ""The restaurant anecdote is just symbolic of the many daily things women still have to endure even in this post #metoo era. ""Some even said they don't feel comfortable dining alone for fear of objectification - that eating unaccompanied is a brave thing to do."" Gloria Atanmo has built a successful career as a travel blogger US travel blogger Gloria Atanmo definitely recognises feeling exposed when dining by herself during five years exploring the world. ""I travel by myself a lot and I have definitely had times where people look at me like I am waiting for a customer,"" she told the BBC. But there have also been the more blatant incidents where there was no mistaking exactly how she - a single woman of Nigerian origin - was seen, even when dressed in jeans and a jumper. ""I think Rome was possibly my worst experience,"" she recalled. ""I'm waiting under a bus stop sign, and every five or 10 minutes a car would slow down as it passed. ""Finally, I got on the bus and maybe about five minutes into the drive I noticed women claiming their 'corner'. And they literally looked like me."" Watch: 'Every day I go to work and pray I'm safe' How a sex pest police officer was exposed What's it like for a woman who's harassed? Gloria also decided to write about her experiences on her blog,external, and, just like Clementine, was inundated with women wanting to share their stories of being single, and being mistaken for sex workers. But it wasn't just one group which found themselves stereotyped. In some places, looking Russian or eastern European meant you were equally likely to be perceived as a prostitute. The assumption a single woman by herself must be a sex worker is also not restricted to just the bars, restaurants and streets. Last year, Sherry Collins - the founder and editor of creative industry bible Pitch - revealed she had been asked ""how much for the night"" by a man during an event at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. This video can not be played Taking a stand against sexism and racism in the advertising industry As a result, she decided to take out a full page advert on the back page of her magazine the next year. It said, in capitals: ""We are black creative women heading to Cannes. Please do not ask us how much for the night #AssumeNothing."" ""I speak out about this because I don't want someone I care about who works with me to experience what I experienced,"" she explained. Clementine had similar motivations when she spoke out: she says the article was her way of lifting the lid on a part of the fight for equality which doesn't often get talked about - the small ways in which women are objectified, or diminished, on a daily basis. ""I am surprised that my essay has received such widespread attention,"" she said. ""But it has struck me that the reason for this is that it has hit a cultural nerve, sparked another layer of debate with respects to equal rights that has not yet been appropriately called out or covered in mainstream debate."" Most importantly, none of these women are willing to go unheard - and they are not willing to back down. Even with everything she has experienced, Gloria refuses to give up on any aspect of the life she choose to live - including eating alone. ""I think there is something empowering about eating and drinking by yourself,"" Gloria said. ""You become an enigma. ""It says, I do not need someone on my arm to exist the way I want.""

"This video can not be played The world-famous tidying wizard visited Woman's Hour in 2017 ""We normally see an increase in donations in January, but this year it's been incredible,"" says Oya Altinbas, who manages Sue Ryder's Camden branch. She says the charity shop is getting 30 large bags a day - double what it would normally expect - with many donors referencing Marie Kondo's Netflix series on de-cluttering your home as their inspiration. The ""KonMari"" method encourages owners to discard items which no longer ""spark joy"", promising a clean mind as well as a clean home. The Japanese tidying guru's 2014 book was a New York Times best-seller but since the launch of her Netflix series at the beginning of January she has taken the UK by storm. Does tidiness really equal a clean mind? Marie Kondo v book hoarders Charities including Age UK, Barnado's and the British Heart Foundation said their shops had reported an increase in donations since the show's launch. All acknowledged the increase could not be put down to a single cause and that charities tend to see a spike in donations in January anyway, with many people having a clear out and donating unwanted gifts after Christmas. However, anecdotal evidence suggests the Marie Kondo de-cluttering trend could be one factor. In her Netflix series Marie Kondo helps people de-clutter their homes Maria Vicencio, who manages disability charity Scope's Cambridge branch, says she knows when someone has watched the show because she recognises Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"". ""I've had some really neat donations dropped off recently - immaculately folded,"" she says. ""I've spoken to a lot of friends and customers who are obsessed with the series."" The shop has seen a sudden influx of donations this month - in line with the charity as a whole, which has seen a year-on-year increase in donations to its shops of 5% over the past six weeks. Maria Vicencio recognised Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"" after watching the show herself Karen Bertram, manager at Salvation Army's Tamworth branch, is equally convinced the trend is having an impact. ""Before we would get about three donations a week,"" she says. ""The last few weeks we are getting six a day."" She says the shop is seeing lots of new donors, including one man who had cleared out his mum's whole house after watching the show. Maria says just because donations may be a result of de-cluttering doesn't mean they aren't high quality. A Prada top and Alexander McQueen shoes were among the donations to her Cambridge shop in the past few weeks. Maria says designer items have been among the donations to her shop in recent weeks Anna Slawinska only discovered Marie Kondo a couple of weeks ago but she has already dropped three bin bags stuffed full of clothes and other unwanted items to her local charity shop and plans to donate more. ""I tend to over buy so the stuff I'm giving away is still in good condition,"" says the 35-year-old, who lives in Morecambe. ""Even though for me it no longer 'sparks joy', hopefully someone else will love it."" Anna has tried out Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"" herself She says the Marie Kondo philosophy has encouraged her to donate more to charity. ""It was very enlightening for me. I struggle with being very messy and I never know what to throw out,"" she says. ""The idea of 'sparking joy' has helped me part with things I don't use anymore."" Sammi George has donated items including clothes, DVDs and books after watching the Netflix series Sammi George, 27, from Surrey, is another Marie Kondo convert and was inspired to donate three bags full of belongings after watching the Netflix series. ""I would consider myself a very sentimental person, however my parents and boyfriend may correct me on that and use the term hoarder,"" she says. ""I have boxes and boxes of things I've kept over the years or bought because it was reduced and 'I'll use that one day.' ""I put everything I owned onto the bed and then one by one, picked each item up and asked myself if I would care whether it went missing or not."" Sammi says charity shops are the perfect destination for unloved belongings. ""The money raised is for a good cause and saves things being buried in a landfill somewhere!""

"Cindi Decker had no idea her painting would attract so much attention on social media It sounds like the beginning of a children's nursery rhyme: ""I painted the woman who painted the guy who painted the lady who painted the swan."" That is howone social media user,externaldescribed her picture, in the latest ""paintception"" phenomenon which is taking Reddit by storm. The craze has produced dozens of mind-bending pictures, depicting paintings within paintings. And it all started with a picture of an egret, painted by Cindi Decker, which was then posted to Reddit by her son. ""I am just a very ordinary mum who has had an extraordinary few days"" Cindi, a 55-year-old teacher from Jacksonville, Florida said. Reddit user Gaddafo posted this picture of his mum on Reddit Cindi, who must now be one of the most popular mothers on Reddit, painted her egret, dubbed a ""swan"" by social media users, at an art class she attended with a friend one evening. She had no idea what her son had in mind. ""I honestly thought he was just showing his friends on Snapchat,"" she admitted. ""I don't even know what an upvote is."" Thepicture of Cindi holding her painting,externalhas now received 75,000 upvotes on Reddit and is proving popular on other social media sites, includingImgur,externalwhere it has been viewed 1.14 million times. ""I am not an artist, simply a regular mum"" she added. While Cindi was the original artist, this latest trend to paint a picture of a picture started with Kristoffer Zetterstrand, a 45-year-old artist from Sweden who said he was browsing Reddit and saw several photos of mothers showing off their paintings. ""I thought it was cute, and had the idea that I would paint one of those photos just for fun,"" he told the BBC. Kristoffer Zetterstrand started this latest craze with his painting of a painting ""It's really weird,"" he said, describing the craze he has instigated. ""Last I counted there were over 40 paintings.  I keep getting smaller and smaller. ""It's been very surprising,"" he added. As a result he's had hundreds of positive comments about his artwork, and 120,000 upvotes in five days for hisReddit post,external. ""I've spoken to the original artist and she's very happy about the whole thing. I'm going to send her my painting."" And then Reddit user lillyofthenight spotted Kristoffer's painting and decided to immortalise him and Cindi - her picture has received 112,000 upvotes in 72 hours. 'Took a while and not perfect, but I painted the guy who painted the other guy's mum' said Reddit user lillyofthenight And so it continues with other artists adding to the mix. 'How could I choose?

"Frazer Mackay may have saved the young thornback ray A young thornback ray has been saved at Macduff Marine Aquarium in Aberdeenshire - after being allowed to grow in a sandwich bag. The ray was trapped in its egg case - known as a mermaid's purse - and would have died. Aquarium employee Frazer Mackay peeled open the case and put the ray, still at the embryo stage, in the bag. The ray is now a month old and the aquarium said it is ""thriving"" in the sandwich bag in a quarantine tank. Mr Mackay said: ""This one's been quite lucky. I actually found it while I was clearing out the tank. ""All the others had hatched and I was removing the empty egg cases. ""I picked up this one and I gave it a bit of a squish to get all the air out, and it didn't squish so I peeled it open and saw there was still a baby ray inside it. The purse was closed so I assumed it was empty."" He added: ""I peeled it out from the egg case and passed it into the poly pocket and it started wriggling and doing its thing - and it was actually alive which was big sigh of relief.""

"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has rejected an offer of talks from President NicolÃ¡s Maduro amid an ongoing power struggle between the two. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday, a move that has been recognised by several countries, including the US. But Mr Maduro accused him of mounting a coup and cut off diplomatic ties with the US in response. A UN Security Council meeting on the crisis is due to be held on Saturday. President Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after polls marred by an opposition boycott and vote-rigging claims. However, the National Assembly argued that the post of president was vacant because the election was not fair, and that Mr GuaidÃ³, as head of the National Assembly, should take over as acting president. Tens of thousands have taken part in anti-Maduro protests, angry at years of economic freefall. What is happening in Venezuela? What might happen next? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Are you in Venezuela? Email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk The international community is split on whether to recognise Mr Maduro's government. On Friday, Mr Maduro said he was ready to talk to his rival - but Mr GuaidÃ³ said he rejected ""fake dialogue"" and said he would consider offering him amnesty. At a rally in east Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ urged his supporters to keep protesting if, as some fear, he gets arrested. Mr Maduro has so far retained the support of the country's military, but Mr GuaidÃ³ has asked them to ""put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people"" and back him instead. He has also called for major demonstrations demanding Mr Maduro's resignation to be held next week. Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials has hit its population hard and caused millions to flee. Mr Maduro has faced internal opposition and ongoing international criticism for his human rights record and handling of the economy. This video can not be played Thousands attended a rally in Caracas on Wednesday against President Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ said on Wednesday that the country's constitution allows him to take power because Mr Maduro's presidency is illegitimate. He has promised to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, Canada and the UK have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ after he said he was the legitimate president. France, Germany and Spain say they will recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections are not called within eight days. On Saturday, the US is expected to demand a UN Security Council statement recognising Venezuela's National Assembly as the country's ""only democratically elected institution"", Reuters reports. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday However Russia - a UN Security Council member - has condemned foreign support for Mr GuaidÃ³, saying it violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"". On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denounced US policy toward Mr Maduro as ""destructive"". According to Reuters,Russian military contractors have been flown secretly into the country to provide security for the president,external. China, Mexico and Turkey have also publicly backed Mr Maduro. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has appointed a veteran former diplomat as his envoy to deal with the crisis in Venezuela. He said Elliott Abrams would be responsible for all US efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela. Mr Abrams is a prominent neo-conservative who has long argued for an activist foreign policy to spread American values around the world. He served as US Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan. What next for Venezuela?

"Stuart Wells pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving A driver who caused a crash in which a mother lost her unborn child has been jailed for more than three years. A court heard Stuart Wells, 29, may have fallen asleep at the wheel when he drove head-on into two cars on the B3151 at Somerton, Somerset, in March. Jackie Luxon, who was pregnant, and her two-year-old daughter were both seriously injured in the crash. Wells, of Sherborne, Dorset, admitted two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed at Taunton Crown Court for three years and seven months and banned from driving for six years and 10 months. Wells had initially tried to blame a sneeze for the crash but later accepted the case against him. Sentencing him, Judge David Ticehurst said: ""Mr and Mrs Luxon were looking forward to the birth of their child in a few weeks and the fact she is not recognised by the law no doubt adds to their sense of loss."" Jackie Luxon's car was hit head-on by Stuart Wells on the B3151 at Somerton last March The court heard other motorists had seen Wells' Ford Fiesta repeatedly drift in and out of the opposite carriageway over a seven-mile period, while also driving in excess of the 40mph speed limit. One driver described him as a ""real nuisance"" and said he was ""driving aggressively"". The court was told Mrs Luxon's husband had just bought a new car and she was following behind when the crash took place. Wells clipped Mr Luxon's car and crashed head-on into Mrs Luxon's car. In victim impact statements, Mr and Mrs Luxon said that in one-split second ""unquantifiable"" pain had been inflicted upon them. They said: ""In the space of a few hours we lost one child and another was placed in a medically-induced coma."" Mrs Luxon added: ""Our unborn daughter is not recognised in English law as she did not experience life outside my body. ""It's heartbreaking that no prosecution was made for the loss of her life and I hope that this is taken into consideration and changes are made in the law.""

"PCSO Holly Burke was off duty when she was hit by a car being pursued by police in Bearwood Each of the deaths of four people during crashes involving police vehicles is being investigated to see whether there should be improvements in policy and procedure, a watchdog said. The crashes were in London, the West Midlands, Warwickshire, and Leicester. Ian Todd of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said each death would be investigated ""based on their own unique sets of circumstances"". The AA said the deaths could indicate a rise in the use of vehicles in crime.

""We will be independently investigating these incidents based on their own unique sets of circumstances. ""Importantly, as well as examining whether the police drivers were suitably trained and followed agreed police policies and procedures we will also look to see if there are changes and improvements which can be made to those procedures to reduce the risks of deaths and serious injuries in the future."" Mr Todd said the IOPC was already working with the National Police Chiefs' Council and College of Policing and had planned to meet road safety organisations to look at concerns from a public perspective. ""We want to focus our work on where we can maximise learning and influence change.

He told the BBC MPs should be able to vote according to their personal views when the next Brexit motion is debated on Tuesday, ""to resolve things"".

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Mr Gauke - who like Ms Rudd backed Remain in the referendum - warned that the way the UK leaves the EU should not be ""railroaded through"" without Parliament giving consent.

"The recumbent stone circle was found to be about 20 years old An Aberdeenshire stone circle initially thought to be thousands of years old has been identified as a modern replica. An investigation into the site at the parish of Leochel-Cushnie found the stones to be about 20 years old. It was originally thought to be the site of a recumbent stone circle - until the man who built it came forward. The findings sparked excitement among experts and were widely reported. They were initially celebrated as an authentic recumbent stone circle by Adam Welfare of Historic Environment Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council's Archaeology Service. Further archaeological analysis of the stones was being conducted when a former owner of the farm contacted Mr Welfare to say he had built the stone circle in the 1990s. Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said the development was ""disappointing"", but hoped the site would still be appreciated. He said: ""I hope the stones continue to be used and enjoyed - while not ancient it is still in a fantastic location and makes for a great feature in the landscape. ""These types of monument are notoriously difficult to date."" Recumbent stone circles were constructed about 3,500 to 4,500 years ago and are unique to the north east of Scotland. Their defining feature is a large horizontal stone flanked by two upright stones, usually situated between the south-east to south-west of the circle.

"This video can not be played The world-famous tidying wizard visited Woman's Hour in 2017 ""We normally see an increase in donations in January, but this year it's been incredible,"" says Oya Altinbas, who manages Sue Ryder's Camden branch. She says the charity shop is getting 30 large bags a day - double what it would normally expect - with many donors referencing Marie Kondo's Netflix series on de-cluttering your home as their inspiration. The ""KonMari"" method encourages owners to discard items which no longer ""spark joy"", promising a clean mind as well as a clean home. The Japanese tidying guru's 2014 book was a New York Times best-seller but since the launch of her Netflix series at the beginning of January she has taken the UK by storm. Does tidiness really equal a clean mind? Marie Kondo v book hoarders Charities including Age UK, Barnado's and the British Heart Foundation said their shops had reported an increase in donations since the show's launch. All acknowledged the increase could not be put down to a single cause and that charities tend to see a spike in donations in January anyway, with many people having a clear out and donating unwanted gifts after Christmas. However, anecdotal evidence suggests the Marie Kondo de-cluttering trend could be one factor. In her Netflix series Marie Kondo helps people de-clutter their homes Maria Vicencio, who manages disability charity Scope's Cambridge branch, says she knows when someone has watched the show because she recognises Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"". ""I've had some really neat donations dropped off recently - immaculately folded,"" she says. ""I've spoken to a lot of friends and customers who are obsessed with the series."" The shop has seen a sudden influx of donations this month - in line with the charity as a whole, which has seen a year-on-year increase in donations to its shops of 5% over the past six weeks. Maria Vicencio recognised Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"" after watching the show herself Karen Bertram, manager at Salvation Army's Tamworth branch, is equally convinced the trend is having an impact. ""Before we would get about three donations a week,"" she says. ""The last few weeks we are getting six a day."" She says the shop is seeing lots of new donors, including one man who had cleared out his mum's whole house after watching the show. Maria says just because donations may be a result of de-cluttering doesn't mean they aren't high quality. A Prada top and Alexander McQueen shoes were among the donations to her Cambridge shop in the past few weeks. Maria says designer items have been among the donations to her shop in recent weeks Anna Slawinska only discovered Marie Kondo a couple of weeks ago but she has already dropped three bin bags stuffed full of clothes and other unwanted items to her local charity shop and plans to donate more. ""I tend to over buy so the stuff I'm giving away is still in good condition,"" says the 35-year-old, who lives in Morecambe. ""Even though for me it no longer 'sparks joy', hopefully someone else will love it."" Anna has tried out Marie Kondo's ""signature fold"" herself She says the Marie Kondo philosophy has encouraged her to donate more to charity. ""It was very enlightening for me. I struggle with being very messy and I never know what to throw out,"" she says. ""The idea of 'sparking joy' has helped me part with things I don't use anymore."" Sammi George has donated items including clothes, DVDs and books after watching the Netflix series Sammi George, 27, from Surrey, is another Marie Kondo convert and was inspired to donate three bags full of belongings after watching the Netflix series. ""I would consider myself a very sentimental person, however my parents and boyfriend may correct me on that and use the term hoarder,"" she says. ""I have boxes and boxes of things I've kept over the years or bought because it was reduced and 'I'll use that one day.' ""I put everything I owned onto the bed and then one by one, picked each item up and asked myself if I would care whether it went missing or not."" Sammi says charity shops are the perfect destination for unloved belongings. ""The money raised is for a good cause and saves things being buried in a landfill somewhere!""

"The Queen visits the Sandringham branch of the WI each year during her winter stay at the nearby Royal estate The Queen has joined members of her local Women's Institute (WI) in a live version of TV quiz show Pointless hosted by Alexander Armstrong. Her Majesty is said to be an avid viewer of the teatime favourite, in which players compete to find the least obvious answers to questions. Armstrong, the show's presenter, described the Queen as ""our most distinguished viewer"". Her team was crowned winner of the contest at the Sandringham WI. She visits the group every year as part of her winter stay at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. West Newton Village Hall was divided into two teams for the live game - one headed by the Queen and the other by Yvonne Browne, vice-president of the WI group. Alexander Armstrong said meeting the Queen was ""a dream come true"" Five matches took place, with the royal's team winning three. Armstrong - who presented Sandringham WI with a trophy - has previously claimed a ""Palace insider"" told him the monarch was a fan of the programme. He said the Queen gave some answers herself and had ""some deft, silky Pointless skills"". ""I think Her Majesty and the team can be very pleased with themselves tonight and go back covered in glory,"" he said. ""I think they can look back over the match and feel rightly proud of what they achieved."" Speaking before the event, Armstrong said meeting the Queen would be ""a dream come true"". He added: ""I think everyone I've ever spoken to has said they've had a dream where they had tea with the Queen - I'm going to get to do that."" The monarch was all smiles as she arrived at the WI meeting The Queen arrived for the event in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover. She posed for a group photograph, unveiled the branch's centenary plaque and was given a celebratory cake. During her speech to the event, the Queen told her fellow members: ""Of course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. ""As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture."" Ms Browne said it had been ""a really lovely afternoon"". ""The Queen very graciously said a few words about the fact it was our centenary and she hoped that the fun and friendship would continue into the next century,"" she said. The Queen has been a member of the Sandringham WI since 1943, when she was still Princess Elizabeth.

"Frazer Mackay may have saved the young thornback ray A young thornback ray has been saved at Macduff Marine Aquarium in Aberdeenshire - after being allowed to grow in a sandwich bag. The ray was trapped in its egg case - known as a mermaid's purse - and would have died. Aquarium employee Frazer Mackay peeled open the case and put the ray, still at the embryo stage, in the bag. The ray is now a month old and the aquarium said it is ""thriving"" in the sandwich bag in a quarantine tank. Mr Mackay said: ""This one's been quite lucky. I actually found it while I was clearing out the tank. ""All the others had hatched and I was removing the empty egg cases. ""I picked up this one and I gave it a bit of a squish to get all the air out, and it didn't squish so I peeled it open and saw there was still a baby ray inside it. The purse was closed so I assumed it was empty."" He added: ""I peeled it out from the egg case and passed it into the poly pocket and it started wriggling and doing its thing - and it was actually alive which was big sigh of relief.""

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Nearly 300 people are missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. The break caused a sea of muddy sludge that buried the dam's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch on Friday. Rescue teams used earth-moving machinery at the site near the town of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state. State governor Romeu Zema said there was little chance of finding people alive. So far 11 people have been confirmed dead. It is not clear what caused the collapse of the dam, owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, President Jair Bolsonaro flew over the disaster area in a helicopter. He tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. Also on Saturday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama) issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Meanwhile a sum of 5bn reais has been frozen from Vale's accounts by a court to help fund recovery works and handle damage claims. The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what is consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers live, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed at the time of the accident. But Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the accident may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. The Globo website later reported that rescue officials provided the following breakdown on the number of the missing: Between 100 and 150 people in the administrative area close to the burst dam About 30 people in the Vila VÃ©rtico area About 35 people at Nova Estancia Inn Between 100 and 140 people in the Parque das Cachoeiras Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed. Many other residents have been evacuated as a safety measure. ""I'm anxious, I want news,"" 28-year-old Helton Pereira told the BBC as he waited outside a hospital in nearby Belo Horizonte - his 28-year-old wife and 35-year-old sister worked at the dam's cafeteria and were both missing. ""From now, the odds are minimal and it's most likely we'll recover only bodies,"" Governor Zema said. The dam is owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale Hopes are fading for survivors The powerful current swept everything in its way Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had capacity for 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. Mr Schvartsman called it a ""human tragedy"" and said a German company, hired to assess the dam, indicated in the most recent report last September that it was stable. The firm said it was monitoring all its other dams. A report by Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said therisk of collapse of the dam had been mentioned in a ""tense meeting"" that approved its licence,externallast month (in Portuguese). Roads have been destroyed by the sludge, complicating rescue efforts The environmental activist group Greenpeace said the dam break was ""a sad consequence of the lessons not learned by the Brazilian government and the mining companies."" It said the incidents ""are not accidents but environmental crimes that must be investigated, punished and repaired"". On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area. After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais with the Brazilian government.
