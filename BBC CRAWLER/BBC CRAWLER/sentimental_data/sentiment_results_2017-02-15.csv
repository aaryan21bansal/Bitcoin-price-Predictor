"Alexis Sanchez scored his 20th goal of the season but it counted for little Arsenal's Champions League hopes lie in tatters at the last-16 stage yet again following a first-leg battering at Bayern Munich. The Gunners, who have been eliminated in the first knockout round of the competition in each of the last six seasons, twice by Bayern, not only conceded five goals but over 75% possession in Germany. Their challenge lasted until the break thanks to Alexis Sanchez, who followed up his own missed penalty to equalise after Arjen Robben's superbly-struck 25-yard opener. But after Arsenal lost Laurent Koscielny to injury early in the second half, Bayern ran riot during a 10-minute period in which Robert Lewandowski headed home before Thiago Alcantara scored twice. Substitute Thomas Muller rubbed salt in the wounds with a late fifth. It leaves Arsenal with a near impossible task in the second leg and heaps more pressure on manager Arsene Wenger, who now only has the FA Cup as a realistic source of silverware in what will go down as another failed season. Relive Arsenal's hammering at Bayern Munich Arsene Wenger: Arsenal 'mentally collapsed' Is it time for Wenger to go? Read the social media fall-out 'Arsenal are a laughing stock' - Henry Winter Arjen Robben (10) finished it with aplomb, but the move for Bayern's opening goal included a touch for nine of the home players on the pitch There must have been a feeling of deflated dread for Arsenal when they were drawn to face Bayern in the first knockout round of this season's Champions League. For the first time in five seasons, the Gunners claimed top spot in their group (ahead of PSG, who made this achievement even more impressive with their demolition of Barcelona on Tuesday) but nonetheless they were drawn against the Germans - their last-16 conquerors in both 2012-13 and 2013-14. Their fears were fully realised on a chastening night in Munich, which further highlighted just how far behind Europe's leading lights they have fallen and how little progress has been made since their visit here last season, which also ended in a 5-1 hammering. Robben gave early warning of the horror to come when he cut inside from the right and fired into the top corner from range following a move that had involved nine of Bayern's 11 players. However, with the gates fully ajar, the flood failed to come as Arsenal were granted an unlikely way back into the game thanks to Lewandowski's clumsy challenge on Koscielny in the box. Sanchez almost spurned it when his spot-kick was saved by Neuer but after fortunately receiving the ball back, he produced a neat finish through a group of players to level. The equaliser prompted Arsenal's best period of the game, during which they remained largely without the ball but produced two clear-cut chances, both of which were wasted as Granit Xhaka and Mesut Ozil struck shots at Neuer after being handed a clear sight of goal.

Four minutes after Gabriel had replaced his captain at the back, Bayern reclaimed the lead as Lewandowski rose high above Shkodran Mustafi to meet Philipp Lahm's excellent cross and head home his 31st goal in 34 games for club and country this season. The Pole then turned provider for Thiago, backheeling the ball into his path for a simple finish before the Spaniard quickly added his second courtesy of a shot that deflected in off Xhaka's boot. Only some lax finishing, the woodwork (from a deflected Lewandowski shot) and a superb David Ospina save to tip over Javi Martinez's header from a corner prevented further goals before late substitute Muller scored with essentially his first contribution, collecting from Thiago before sidefooting home. Muller's late goal surely represented the final nail in the Gunners' coffin and leaves Wenger now facing an uncomfortable, undesirable truth - that his side's season boils down to an FA Cup game on a plastic pitch in Sutton. Two shots, two goals, one assist - in a team full of impressive performances, Spanish midfielder Thiago still stood out, such was the quality of his individual display This video can not be played Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal: Wenger on Gunners 'nightmare' Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BT Sport:""It is difficult to explain. I felt we had two good chances to score just before half-time. ""I felt we were unlucky for the second goal. The referee gave a corner for us at first. Then we concede the second goal and then the most important was that we lost Koscielny. We collapsed. ""Overall I must say they are a better team than us, they played very well in the second half and we dropped our level. We were a bit unlucky we dropped our level and they were better than us."" Bayern Munich have won their last 16 home Champions League games, the longest winning run in the history of the competition. Arsenal conceded five goals in a game for the first time since November 2015 - their last clash with Bayern (1-5). This is the first time that Arsenal have conceded five goals in a first leg of Champions League knockout match. Arsenal have conceded 3+ goals in four of their last six first-leg matches in the last 16 of the Champions League. It's also the first time that Arsenal have conceded four goals in a single half since facing Chelsea in March 2014. Alexis Sanchez has been directly involved in 33 goals in his last 31 games in all comps (20 goals, 13 assists). Robert Lewandowski has scored 15 goals in his last 13 Champions League games at the Allianz Arena. Arjen Robben has now scored in back-to-back Champions League appearances against Arsenal.

"Carli Lloyd celebrates scoring her hat-trick in Vancouver, the first in a Women's World Cup final When Carli Lloyd scored from the halfway line to complete a hat-trick in the first 16 minutes of the 2015 Women's World Cup final, her United States team-mate Hope Solo ran from her goal to scream: ""Are you even human?"" Having already scored winning goals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympic finals, Lloyd was already one of the most celebrated players in the United States. But earning America's first World Cup in 16 years and scoring such a spectacular goal pitched the midfielder's status to almost superhero level, with 2015 and 2016 Fifa World Player of the Year awards following. After spending years training on her own in a sparse field in Delran, New Jersey, and showing a single-mindedness which led to a relationship breakdown with her parents, Lloyd had finally proven her doubters wrong to reach the pinnacle of her sport. Now a new journey begins for the 34-year-old US captain after leaving Houston Dash for a short-term deal with Manchester City, which former England striker Kelly Smith, a former club team-mate of Lloyd's, calls a ""coup"". City will now hope Lloyd's undoubted stardust and renowned dedication rub off on a team who are gunning for the Champions League title in their competition debut. For those unfamiliar with Lloyd's story, her 55-yard lob in the World Cup final victory against Japan was no fluke. It was the product of a feverish commitment to training - which included smashing shots from the halfway line - with her coach and mentor James Galanis. He has been credited with moulding a young player with serious confidence problems and a body not built for an elite midfielder into the world's best player. As detailed in her autobiography, When Nobody Was Watching, it is clear nothing gets in the way of Lloyd's ambition to continually improve. And the good news for Manchester City fans is that, even after her World Cup triumph, she believes she can get even better. ""Her determination exceeds anyone I've ever met,"" Smith, who played with Lloyd for the New Jersey Wildcats in 2004 and spent the majority of her playing career in the US, told BBC Sport. Carli Lloyd facts Born:16 July, 1982, Delran, New Jersey Clubs:New Jersey Wildcats, Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue FC, Atlanta Beat, Western New York Flash, Houston Dash Country:US debut in 2005; 232 appearances and 96 goals Honours:2008 & 2012 Olympic gold medallist, 2015 World Cup winner, 2015 and 2016 Fifa World Player of the Year Fuelling that drive is a quest for perfection and a desire to prove people wrong. It began when she was dropped from the Under-21 national team and was ready to quit football altogether, toying with the idea of becoming an FBI agent. But then she met Australian coach Galanis, a trainee electrician, who offered a turning point in her career and proved a lifelong mentor. In 2004 he concocted a 12-year plan, which included Lloyd becoming World Player of the Year by 2016. While her relationship with Galanis has been the backbone of her success, some of her family have blended into the background. Her golfer husband, Brian Hollins, whom she met in her teens, has learned to stay away from big tournaments to prevent any distractions. And Lloyd's long-running feud with her parents dates back to the beginning of her career when she chose to do things her own way. They disapproved of her aloofness around US team-mates and a choice of agent, and weeks before her triumph at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, asked her to move her possessions out of their home. Lloyd hints in her book they may have been jealous of the part Galanis has played in her career and despite calling the situation ""heartbreaking"", has not spoken to them since 2012. Lloyd says she ""doesn't do fake"" and has had disagreements with former US coaches but current manager Jill Ellis, who has had a long-standing connection with her captain since she managed the under-21 team, has said Lloyd is ""team-orientated"" and ""real"". Washington Spirit midfielder Joanna Lohman, who has known Lloyd since they were 14 and played in the same US youth team, told BBC Sport: ""It's great to have that edge, look where it's taken her. ""When you don't back down on things and you see things as challenges as opposed to failures, it pushes you even harder."" Lloyd won Fifa World Player of the year in 2015 after her World Cup triumph. She will play for Manchester City from April until 3 June As a big Liverpool fan, Lloyd has always looked up to former Red Steven Gerrard as the player she wanted to emulate: a box-to-box midfielder with an eye for goal and a fearsome shot. Smith likens her more to former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard for her ""goalscoring ability, and how she arrives late in the box"" but says it has taken time to develop those skills. ""She wasn't the most technical back when we played, she isn't like Brazilian forward Marta, who beats two or three players at a time,"" Smith adds. ""But she was always very fit, had a fantastic work-rate and was a winner."" That much has been proven in her international career, with three major titles and 96 goals in 232 appearances, making her the national team's all-time highest goal-scoring midfielder. Current US boss Ellis calls Lloyd ""incredible for her consistency in big games"". Club success for Lloyd has been less impressive. She is yet to win a US domestic championship - the closest she came was a runners-up medal with Western New York Flash in 2013, so winning the Champions League or FA Cup with Manchester City would be a glittering addition to her CV. Can she help City achieve that success in the twilight of her career? Lloyd has already proven that age has little effect on her work-rate. ""Carli's a leader on and off the pitch and her winning mentality will help them reach the next level,"" Smith says. Former England captain Casey Stoney says Lloyd will have a massive influence on City and the league. ""She's not past her peak,"" the Liverpool defender said. ""Look at [Manchester United forward] Zlatan Ibrahimovic - he's playing some of the best football of his career and he's 35. ""Experience buys you time on the ball and better decision-making. It wouldn't surprise me if she was playing in the next World Cup in two years' time."" Lloyd is joining a Manchester City side who won the FA WSL in their third season. The league is shifting from a summer schedule to a winter one, culminating in a one-off Spring Series starting in April If Manchester City were looking for a marquee signing to demonstrate their growing status in women's football, then Lloyd is a stunning addition to their squad. Lloyd is one of several US players who have recently left their country to ply their trade in Europe. The best paid player in women's football, Alex Morgan,joined French side Lyon,lightning-fast winger Crystal Dunn signed for Chelsea and midfielder Heather O'Reilly, who recently retired from international football,joined Arsenal. But according to Stoney, Lloyd will be ""the biggest overseas player to have played in England, without a doubt"". It is likely she will have a salary to match. City, who only played their first season in the FA Women's Super League in 2014, won the title last season, and with the club's wealthy owners investing more in players and facilities than any other English side, a period of dominance looks likely. Part of that masterplan is to make inroads in Europe in their debut Champions League season, which continues with a quarter-final tie against Danish side Fortuna Hjorring on 23 March. But as much as Lloyd can benefit City, they can also provide a new chapter for the attacking midfielder. US boss Ellis, who was born in England, has encouraged American players to experience European football in a year when there are no major tournaments. It comes at a time when US players are in a pay dispute with the national federation, but Smith believes it has more to do with the quality of the football on offer in Europe. ""The game in America can often be quite back to front and long ball, but players are more technical in Europe and nowhere more than in the Champions League so players want to sample that,"" she says. ""Lloyd will also experience the best facilities around. Sometimes in the American league you use university pitches and changing rooms, so to be part of a club like Manchester City can be quite precious to Carli.""

"The London Dungeon tourist attraction has apologised for a promotional Twitter campaign that backfired. A graphic joking about a murdered sex worker, and another about infecting a partner with a sexually transmitted disease were posted on the attraction's Twitter feed. Critics said the collection of images was sexist and offensive. Merlin Entertainment said it was ""very sorry"" for the campaign and has deleted the tweets. The group said it had wanted to run a ""dark Valentine campaign"" to promote the London Dungeon, in which visitors are taken on a tour through London's dark history. Other messages in the series joked about sex acts, sex workers and body-shamed women But many Twitter users complained that many of the images tweeted were in poor taste and inappropriate for a family tourist attraction. Rebecca Reid, a columnist for the Telegraph, said: ""The biggest issue here is taking violence against women and turning it into a joke or a cheap marketing ploy."" She told the BBC: ""Just because these rapes and murders happened in the past doesn't mean they are fair game. ""Violence, rape and murder are all still a very brutal reality of life for modern day sex workers and these flippant tweets show no awareness or respect for that.""

"Churchill wrote the first draft in 1939, as Europe headed towards war A newly unearthed essay by Winston Churchill reveals he was open to the possibility of life on other planets. In 1939, the year World War Two broke out, Churchill penned a popular science article in which he mused about the likelihood of extra-terrestrial life. The 11-page typed draft, probably intended for a newspaper, was updated in the 1950s but never published. In the 1980s, the essay was passed to a US museum, where it sat until its rediscovery last year. The document was uncovered in the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, by the institution's new director Timothy Riley. Mr Riley then passed it to the Israeli astrophysicist and author Mario Livio who describes the contents inthe latest issue of Nature journal.,external Churchill's interest in science is well-known: he was the first British prime minister to employ a science adviser, Frederick Lindemann, and met regularly with scientists such as Sir Bernard Lovell, a pioneer of radio astronomy. This documented engagement with the scientific community was partly related to the war effort, but he is credited with funding UK laboratories, telescopes and technology development that spawned post-war discoveries in fields from molecular genetics to X-ray crystallography. The Tizard Mission: Start of a special relationship? In the essay, Churchill outlines the concept of habitable zones - more than 50 years before the discovery of exoplanets Despite this background, Dr Livio described the discovery of the essay as a ""great surprise"". He told the BBC's Inside Science programme: ""[Mr Riley] said, 'I would like you to take a look at something.' He gave me a copy of this essay by Churchill. I saw the title, Are We Alone in the Universe? and I said, 'What? Churchill wrote about something like this?'"" Dr Livio says the wartime leader reasoned like a scientist about the likelihood of life on other planets. Churchill's thinking mirrors many modern arguments in astrobiology - the study of the potential for life on other planets. In his essay, the former prime minister builds on the Copernican Principle - the idea that human life on Earth shouldn't be unique given the vastness of the Universe. Churchill defined life as the ability to ""breed and multiply"" and noted the vital importance of liquid water, explaining: ""all living things of the type we know require [it]."" More than 50 years before the discovery of exoplanets, he considered the likelihood that other stars would host planets, concluding that a large fraction of these distant worlds ""will be the right size to keep on their surface water and possibly an atmosphere of some sort"". He also surmised that some would be ""at the proper distance from their parent sun to maintain a suitable temperature"". Churchill also outlined what scientists now describe as the ""habitable"" or ""Goldilocks"" zone - the narrow region around a star where it is neither too hot nor too cold for life. Churchill supported the development of game-changing technologies such as radar Correctly, the essay predicts great opportunities for exploration of the Solar System. ""One day, possibly even in the not very distant future, it may be possible to travel to the Moon, or even to Venus and Mars,"" Churchill wrote. But the politician concluded that Venus and Earth were the only places in the Solar System capable of hosting life, whereas we now know that icy moons around Jupiter and Saturn are promising targets in the search for extra-terrestrial biology. However, such observations are forgivable given scientific knowledge at the time of writing. In an apparent reference to the troubling events unfolding in Europe, Churchill wrote: ""I for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilisation here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures, or that we are the highest type of mental and physical development which has ever appeared in the vast compass of space and time."" Churchill was a prolific writer: in the 1920s and 30s, he penned popular science essays on topics as diverse as evolution and fusion power. Mr Riley, director of the Churchill Museum, believes the essay on alien life was written at the former prime minister's home in Chartwell in 1939, before World War II broke out. It may have been informed by conversations with the wartime leader's friend, Lindemann, who was a physicist, and might have been intended for publication in the News of the World newspaper. It was also written soon after the 1938 US radio broadcast by Orson Welles dramatising The War of the Worlds by HG Wells. The radio programme sparked a panic when it was mistaken by some listeners for a real news report about the invasion of Earth by Martians. Dr Livio told BBC News that there were no firm plans to publish the article because of issues surrounding the copyright. However, he said the Churchill Museum was working to resolve these so that the historically important essay can eventually see the light of day.

"Alicia Keys and John Legend appear in the new series Apple Music has delayed the launch of the new Carpool Karaoke TV series. It had originally been due to premiere this month but the companytold Reuters,externalit will now be ""later this year"". The delay seems a little odd as we know most of the series has already been filmed. But, let's be honest, judging by thefirst trailer,external, which was released in February, it will probably be worth waiting for. No reasons were given for the delay, which will see two celebrities paired up for a singalong session in each of its 16 episodes. The show was commissioned as a series in its own right after the regular Carpool Karaoke segments on The Late Late Show with James Corden proved hugely popular. Here are eight things we can expect from the show (when it arrives), judging by the trailer. 1. Carpool Karaoke no longer needs to be in a car. Or even on the ground Carpool Karaoke is no longer confined by silly little details like, you know, actually being in a car. ""This is the next level,"" says Will Smith, as he guides James Corden towards a waiting helicopter at one point in the trailer. Gravity schmavity. Appropriately, the first song they sing once they are in said aircraft is, of course, R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Reports that they also belted out a rendition of Westlife's Flying Without Wings could not be immediately confirmed. 2. Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane have zero time for parking restrictions At one point, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and singer and all-round awesome person Ariana Grande are shown standing by the parked car. Earlier in the trailer, they had been seen beautifully singing a song from The Little Shop of Horrors. All sweet and innocent and lovely. But look a little closer - and the plot takes a much darker turn. They appear to have pulled up across TWO disabled parking spaces. Ariana is going to have to give us at least six new masterpieces of Side To Side-level quality to redeem herself. 3. It's strange not having James Corden in the driver's seat Since the dawn of time, James Corden has been a ubiquitous presence in the driver's seat of the Carpool Karaoke automobile. Which is fair enough, since he basically came up with the idea when he firstclimbed into a car with George Michael,externalfor Comic Relief in 2011. But he's now allowed someone else to get behind the wheel, which gives us the extremely exciting prospect of episodes with five-piece bands. Or in this case, four-piece bands, plus a guest. The previous application form was limited to a maximum of four people, which allowed us Carpools featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and One Direction 2.0. But behold, now we have comedian Billy Eichner able to hitch a ride with Metallica (pictured). We're trying not to get our hopes up but this could technically pave the way for Little Mix giving Ozzy Osbourne a lift to Sainsbury's. 4. They may need a bigger car ""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" said someone once in some famous movie or other. In this case, the production team are perhaps going to need a bigger car for two of their more well-built guests. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and wrestler John Cena just about managed to squeeze in. Thank goodness it wasn't a Mini. 5. Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler are keen to get their five a day A slice of orange, a chunk of pineapple, a quarter of lime - it's fair to say country singer Blake Shelton and comic Chelsea Handler are fans of fruit. (Alternatively, it's possible that they're just fans of alcohol, served with fruit.) Of course, they could be hoping to become the faces of a new fruit and veg campaign, judging by this segment in the trailer. Because a slice of lemon in your drink counts towards your five a day. Doesn't it. Doesn't it? 6. A lot of people mistake John Legend for Pharrell Williams John Legend takes Alicia Keys and Hidden Figures actress Taraji P. Henson on a little spin in the new Carpool series, with the two singers seen belting out Alicia's Fallin'. (Tune.) But they also have a nice little chat, during which John Legend reveals that people often mistake him for somebody else. ""Old white women think I'm Pharrell [Williams] sometimes,"" he explains. He even briefly belts out the hook of Happy so as not to disappoint this particular fanbase. Maybe it goes both ways and Pharrell is regularly stopped by members of the public and asked for a quick blast of All of Me. 7. Wait. Go back a sec. Is that... a BRASS BAND? Yep. That's a 90-piece brass band. Being conducted from a sun roof by Will Smith. Who is leading them in a rendition of his 1997 treasure Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. I need to lie down. 8. Heavy metal sounds better in the dairy aisle First Blake and Chelsea hit the pub, and look, there's John Legend and Alicia Keys in a laundrette. Straight in at number one in the Look We Can Be Normal chart, however, is Metallica in a supermarket. If you haven't experienced Enter Sandman being performed next to the free range eggs, you've not heard Mozart the way it was meant to be played.

"For Radio 4's PM programme, the BBC's Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly and assistant political editor Norman Smith, are working with the BBC's Reality Check team to answer your questions about what Brexit means. Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal. So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come. Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to job seeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Norman Smith says: Now, before everyone starts pressing the panic button, for the next two years while we are still in the EU, EU citizens have an absolute right to stay and remain here, no questions asked. It is also true that the government has made absolutely clear they want to guarantee those rights to existing EU citizens who are here and married to Brits after we leave the EU. That is their clear intention. The reason they have not been able to do that, they say, is that they've not yet been able to firm up the position of Brits in the same position in other parts of the EU. So it's clearly the government's ambition to ensure everything stays the same. If it doesn't, then I guess you'll be in the same position as other non-EU spouses of British citizens. And that would mean that your British spouse would have to be able to show that you had a minimum income of between Â£18,600 and Â£27,200 if you were to be allowed to stay. On the plus side, I think there will be clarity on this pretty quickly because it is clear Mrs May wants this sorted out right at the start of the negotiations. I think many other EU countries think the same, that it's unacceptable to have this level of uncertainty, so it will be decided very, very quickly. And even if it's not, the government is going to have to introduce an immigration bill to announce our new immigration criteria ahead of Brexit. So it will be in MPs' hands to decide whether EU spouses have the right to remain. But I think we will get clarity sooner rather than later. Norman Smith says: At the moment, we can be sure that if we feel a little bit peaky in another part of the EU then we're pretty much OK because we can get the same sort of healthcare as citizens already in that country. That applies to prescriptions, GP visits and hospitals stays. What happens when we leave the EU is, like so much of Brexit-land, unknown. However, what we do know is that the government would rather like the current system to continue. How do we know that? We know that because the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said as much. In a recent health select committee meeting, he was asked about this and whether the current card scheme would be scrapped and his answer was: I hope not. So the clear hope of government is that we can pretty much bumble on with the current arrangements. If, however, that were not possible, we could still have deals with individual countries about reciprocal health rights, because we already have that with a number of countries such as Australia, Israel, and Russia. But there are no guarantees we will be able to arrive at these reciprocal deals. So my guess is that it will be in everyone's interest just to carry on with the current coverage. But failing that, my advice would be to keep taking the vitamins, pack some Lemsip and stay away from draughty windows when you're travelling abroad. Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response. But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future. Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate. The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction. The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members. It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here. The 2015 Conservative manifesto talked about curtailing the ECHR's role but not about leaving it altogether. Leaving the court would be another big decision and the government might well decide that it's got enough on its plate at the moment.

"Kim Jong-nam grew up in secret, literally sealed behind palace gates Kim Jong-nam was the eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and the elder half-brother of current leader Kim Jong-un. Jong-nam was born in May 1971 in Pyongyang. His mother was North Korea's film actress Song Hye-rim.  She was the daughter of South Korean communist intellectuals who migrated to the North during the Korean War. She was four or five years older than Kim Jong-il and was still married to another man (with whom she had a child) when they began their romantic relationship. By the conservative standards of North Korean society, this was a fairly sordid relationship, and for many years Kim Jong-il concealed his common law wife and new son from his father, Kim Il-sung. At the time of Kim Jong-nam's birth, Kim Jong-il was the leading candidate to succeed his father, and details of his relationship with Ms Song, if they had become public, could have derailed his ambitions (particularly as his nearest political rival was his despised stepmother). Because of the nature of the relationship, Kim Jong-nam was shuttered away in a large residence in central Pyongyang. As his mother suffered from a variety of physical and mental infirmities requiring treatment outside North Korea, he lived with his maternal grandmother and his maternal aunt, Song Hye-rang. The second Ms Song was an author and widow with two children of her own. When Jong-nam was an infant, his aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, (Kim Jong-il's sister) tried to take the baby away and adopt him as her own child. She was overruled, but she would always support Jong-nam. Instead, he grew up in secret, literally sealed behind palace gates. Kim Jong-il doted on his son - co-sleeping with him, eating dinner and telephoning him when he was too busy to return home. Despite rumours perpetuated by South Korean sources, Jong-nam did eventually meet and forge a relationship with grandfather Kim Il-sung. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has remained tight-lipped on the latest murder claims In 1979, Jong-nam began a 10-year odyssey studying and living outside North Korea. He stayed in Russia and Switzerland and eventually became fluent in French and English, returning to North Korea in the late 1980s. His exposure to the outside world and his impatience living in relative social isolation in Pyongyang and Wonsan led him to question North Korea's political and economic system. At several points, Kim Jong-il became so frustrated with Jong-nam that he threatened to send the young man to a political prison camp to work in a coal mine. According to his aunt, the threat of imprisonment was so real that the family took measures to buy adequate clothing and shoes for the day when they would be sent away. Instead of being incarcerated, Jong-nam spent his 20s contending with his father's demands and unrealistic expectations. Jong-nam would never be a viable candidate as his father's successor, but he still joined the family business. He would be linked to North Korea's internal security apparatus and its foreign exchange-earning operations outside the country. During the Arduous March of the 1990s, as thousands of North Korean citizens starved to death, Jong-nam participated in audits in which central party officials reviewed the finances and business practices of state-owned factories. Kim Il-sung (left) with his son Kim Jong-il at a mass rally in Pyongyang in September 1983 After some of these audits, Jong-nam would witness the public executions of factory managers accused of stealing from the state. All of this would be enough to disillusion Jong-nam about the country in which he was born and the political system his father and grandfather led. He married in the late 1990s and fathered several children. From the early 2000s onward, Jong-nam would begin to reside outside the DPRK, living at the Kim family's houses in Macau and a separate residence in Beijing. He would be tasked with managing some of the family's financial accounts (which total billions of dollars). He also would be involved in some of North Korea's illicit business operations. While Jong-nam was never directly involved in such activities as narcotics trafficking or arms smuggling, he did have an active role in seeing that some of the monies from both legitimate and illicit activities avoided the scrutiny of legal authorities. It was no accident that Jong-nam frequented casinos throughout Asia and maintaining some of these financial interests led to a jet-set lifestyle and cemented his reputation as something of a ""party boy"". Rewind back to 1979, when Jong-nam went overseas. Kim Jong-il got drunk as Jong-nam departed the country and tearfully reproached Song Hye-rang: ""You... you are doing this. You are taking my boy away from me."" By the late 1970s, Kim Jong-il had begun a relationship with a dancer in the prestigious Mansudae Art Troupe, an ethnic Korean repatriated from Japan named Ko Yong-hui. With his son out of the country, Kim Jong-il set up a household with Ko and fathered three children with her, the middle one being the current leader Kim Jong-un. In contrast to his other wives and common law partners, Ko actually took an interest in Pyongyang's palace politics and, what is more, Kim Jong-il fell passionately in love with her. Jong-nam would later tell an outsider that - once he had left North Korea to study - his father used his relationship with Ko and their children to fill the void left by Jong-nam. Ko was ambitious. She befriended the close aides and generals that made up her husband's entourage. When Jong-nam returned from studying abroad in the late 1980s, there were already rumours among Kim family staff that the ""button nose"" (referring to Ko) was positioning her children for succession, even though discussions about hereditary succession were generally prohibited and could get some North Koreans sent to the firing squad. During the late 1990s to early 2000s, Ko acted as a de-facto first lady, accompanying her husband on military inspections and greeting top North Korean leadership. This would lay the groundwork for one of sons, Jong-un or his older brother, Jong-chol, to become hereditary successor. When Jong-nam was arrested at a Tokyo airport with a counterfeit passport in May 2001, it initially served to embarrass the Kim family and other North Korean elites because it exposed the fact that they sometimes travelled using passports with assumed identities. It has been widely misinterpreted and misreported that this incident sidelined Jong-nam as hereditary successor; he never was. But this incident was used internally by Ko to press the claims that one of her sons would succeed Kim Jong-il. And so, unwittingly, the exaggerated rivalry between Jong-un and Jong-nam was born. With numerous pronouncements and analyses that Jong-un is engaged in a ""reign of terror"" targeting North Korean political leaders or that his leadership (not to mention his mental health) are ""unstable"", it doesn't serve Jong-un's public image or political interests to have his half-brother assassinated. It would just feed the rumours, and one doubts that Jong-un would give his South Korean counterpart that kind of satisfaction. Jong-nam was not a threat or a credible rival to Jong-un's leadership. He had no interest in the job itself. Living outside the country as long as he has, Jong-nam could not form a power base among DPRK elites and was largely clueless about how to seize the regime's nodes of control. Jong-nam was also closely tied to Chinese elites and had lived under some protection from Chinese authorities. Within the past few months, Pyongyang has made an attempt to shore up ties with Beijing, a major ally and its largest trading partner. Unless Jong-nam had outlived his usefulness to elements of the Chinese government, it is not in Jong-un's geopolitical interests in the region to have his half-brother killed. Jong-nam didn't possess a significant powerbase in Pyongyang. Publicly and privately, he expressed little interest in taking the reins of power in North Korea. South Korean TV extensively covered the death of Jong-nam However, given his heritage, Jong-nam was viewed by some elderly North Korean elites as a kind of grandson figure. These elites were close comrades of Kim Il-sung. They knew Jong-nam's personal history, his back story, and so he was treated with a special affection by some of the country's top heroes. This affection and relationship could not necessarily form a basis of political support domestically, but it would have been helpful had Jong-nam ever put himself forward as a political rival to his half-brother. Malaysia hunts for Kim death suspects A history of foreign assassinations Meet North Korea's secretive 'first family' Pyongyang's latest missile test explained Since Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011, North Korea's state media have gone out of their way to show these revolutionary elders praising Jong-un. At state events, Jong-un always makes a point of greeting these elders (and being photographed and filmed doing so). This goes above and beyond merely paying respect to his elders and national heroes. Instead, for propaganda purposes, Jong-un needs to be seen as having the blessing of North Korea's founding generation. More importantly, it conveys the message that the ruling elite at least appears unified in its support for the youthful leader. If Jong-nam had been going to mount a power challenge to Jong-un, it would not have helped him that his two possible primary patrons as hereditary successor or would-be challenger to Jong-un's rule - his uncle Chang Song-thaek and his aunt Kim Kyong-hui - are no longer active in Pyongyang's power circles. Madame Kim effectively retired from political life after her husband Chang was executed on Jong-un's orders in December 2013. Jong-nam had been the target and subject of disinformation in the South Korean press for almost 30 years. Because of his business and personal activities (which could possibly have seen him arrested) Jong-nam did very little to push back against the perceptions and rumours about him. He followed his father's suggestion that outsiders should only see ""a fog"" when looking at North Korean leadership. That said, Pyongyang watchers should give the Malaysian authorities some breathing space to do a proper investigation. Already, there are conflicting accounts about Jong-nam's purported demise. For all we know, he may have had a heart attack. Michael Madden is a visiting scholar at the US-Korea Institute at the School for Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University.

"Rumours suggest that Nokia are planning to bring back their iconic 3310 phone. Mobile users of a certain age have been getting very excited on social media about the return of this sturdy, reliable handset. If you were in the market for a new phone in the year 2000, then the 3310 may have been on your wish-list. But when Newsbeat contacted Nokia about the rumours, the company refused to comment. ""Though we're as excited as everyone else to hear their news, as we have often said about such stories, we do not comment on rumour or speculation,"" a spokesperson tells us. If you ever owned one of these phones then the return of the 3310 may be exciting news to you It may seem unlikely in the world of Android and iPhones that anyone would want a 17-year-old handset that was best known for playing Snake, but the experts believe there is a place in the market. ""I'm fairly confident my grandmother could use a 3310, but she wouldn't know where to start with an iPhone or Android,"" Alistair Charlton, deputy technology editor at the IB Times, tells Newsbeat. ""You can take a Â£20 phone to a festival and leave your expensive, glass-fronted iPhone at home. ""Backpackers and the like probably appreciate them too, given their tough build, cheap price and long battery life."" Many smartphone users complain about their handset's battery and this could prove the main selling point for users. ""What an interest in the 3310 does show us though is that battery life is still a major concern for consumers, and one that's not being well-addressed by some smart phones, namely the iPhone,"" Elizabeth Varley, founder and CEO of tech communityTechHub,external, tells Newsbeat. And let's not forget, when Adele revealed the video for Hello back in 2015, she was seen in it making a call on a retro flip phone - not a smart device. Greg James tweeted a picture of the moment.,external Around that time, the media reported a rise in people seeking old phones, as the 1990s were firmly back in fashion and people like Rihanna were walking round chatting on a chunky mobile. So it's not just a phone for drug dealers, as many Twitter users seem to think. Some have joked that non-smart phones are used for illegal business.,external Alistair also backs the author of the original source of the 3310 rumours, VentureBeat writer Evan Blass, as a credible source for technology leaks. He describes the journalist as ""a renowned tech leaker who is often accurate with his predictions."" But Alistair also says that to succeed in the current market, Nokia will need to update the 3310's basic features to be relevant in 2017. ""We don't communicate through calls and SMS as much as we did in the days of the 3310,"" he says. ""If it had an internet connection and access to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, then maybe it has a place."" But Elizabeth Varley doesn't believe Nokia's future can be built on models from the past. ""The best way forward is rarely backwards,"" she says. ""To really compete, innovation is the key.""

"This video can not be played Inside a guinea pig farm Most people see them as fluffy adorable pets, but in Peru guinea pigs - or ""cuy"" as they are known locally - are a delicacy. In the past few years their popularity has really taken off and a boom in guinea pig farming is helping many peasant farmers living below the minimum wage to get out of poverty. You can hear them as soon as you walk into the dusty barn. The open cages are filled with hundreds of squeaking brown and white guinea pigs, waiting for their owner, Maria Camero, to fill up their red water buckets and give them corn. ""In the past it was only people living in the mountains who bred guinea pigs but now we've realised it's a good business,"" says Maria. Guinea pig breeding is ""a good business"", says Maria Camero ""You can start with something like $100 (Â£80) and that money quickly grows because by three months the guinea pigs can start breeding and they will have up to five babies, so the business grows fast."" Maria and her family produce guinea pigs on a much larger scale now thanks to her son-in-law Alessio Cresci. The Italian fell in love with Shelia, Maria's daughter, and decided to move to Peru and build up their business. Maria went from looking after a few guinea pigs to being part of a team breeding hundreds. Previously only farmers in the Andes ate guinea pigs, but they are now popular throughout Peru and Bolivia As well as supplying to local restaurants, they also sell and sometimes donate start-up kits to local farmers who want to get involved, consisting of a breeding pair of guinea pigs and the food and pens that they need. ""I have a daughter who is 13 and I can afford to pay for her to go to a better school, I have also paid for my son to go to university and study to be a graphic designer. This business lets me do that,"" says Maria. Maria's daughter and son-in-law, Shelia and Alessio, have helped build up the business Thirty dollars a month is the average wage for a peasant farmer. Many of them are now earning $130 a month, according to Lionel Vigil, the regional director of World Neighbours, a charity that helps them get started. The key to their success is the restaurant business, which can't get enough of cuy. Farmers can sell them to local restaurants for about $8 and to high-end restaurants in Lima for up to $13. ""The Incas have eaten cuy for centuries, but in the past it was only farmers in the Andes still eating them,"" says Mr Vigil. ""When they migrated to Lima they carried on, and little by little other Peruvians from different backgrounds started to get a taste for it and restaurants started to buy guinea pigs."" Farmers can quadruple their monthly incomes by breeding guinea pigs, says Lionel Vigil of the charity World Neighbours Producers are even looking to the US as a market. Ex-pat Bolivians and Peruvians are prepared to pay $30 for a guinea pig that they eat on special occasions, chopped up and deep fried a bit like chicken. At first it was hard to get permission for officials to let frozen guinea pigs into the US where, like most of the world, they are regarded as pets. But with the support of academics and anthropologists, one exporter, Mega Business, has persuaded authorities that this is part of Andean culture and guinea pigs also have a very important nutritional value. In fact, Peruvians have never seen cuy as pets. And although they accept they are small and sweet, their culinary value trumps their cuteness. Traditional baked guinea pig - though not all visitors to Peru are keen to eat it this way Jaime Pesaque is the owner of Mayta, a high-end restaurant in upmarket Lima. He buys about 200 organically fed guinea pigs a month. He says they are high in protein and low in fat. Traditionally guinea pigs were served teeth, claws and all as a kind of kebab on the local streets - a method that put many people off. Jaime has found a more user-friendly recipe. ""We take out all the bones and cook it the whole night, then we press it for a couple of hours and cook it."" Not your regular cooked guinea pig I was dreading trying this national delicacy. I remember those fangs and claws thrust up at me through a train on my way to Machu Picchu. I vowed never to try it. But things changeâ¦ And Jaime's version is delicious. The meat is sweet and juicy, a bit like rabbit and pork, and the skin is crispy. He has a new convert. Many of the people eating in high-end restaurants are tourists who are eager to try something different - provided it is served in the right way. Although they will always be seen first and foremost as pets for the majority of people in the world, in Peru guinea pigs are offering a way out of poverty.

"Keira Knightley and Hugh Grant will reprise their original roles Romantics rejoice - the cast of Love Actually is reuniting for a short sequel to raise money for Comic Relief. Red Nose Day Actually will be written by Richard Curtis and star Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley and Colin Firth. Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson will also appear in the film, which sets out to discover what the original characters are doing in 2017. The 10-minute sequel will be shown on 24 March on BBC One as part of the Red Nose Day appeal. It comes 14 years after Love Actually was released. Love Actually scriptwriter Emma Freud, Curtis's partner,has asked for ideas for the plot,external, saying the follow-up is still being written. Many have suggested a tribute to the late Alan Rickman, who starred in the original. Another suggestion tweeted to Freud involved Atkinson's character, who was seen in the original as a shop assistant. But Freud's reply? ""Not gonna happen..."". And one fan wanted a happy ending for Emma Thompson's character, after the hard time she had in the first film. Curtis said: ""I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to. ""We hope to make something that'll be fun - very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day."" The writer said he was ""delighted"" that so many of the original cast could take part, adding: ""It'll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together."" Martine McCutcheon, Andrew Lincoln, Lucia Moniz, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Olivia Olson will also reprise their original roles. The original film, set at Christmas time, followed an extensive cast of characters, whose lives intertwined in various ways. Among them was Hugh Grant's character, David - the prime minister at the time - who was seen getting together with Natalie, played by McCutcheon, at the end of the original film. Sam (played by Game of Thrones star Brodie-Sangster, who was 13 at the time), was seen chasing Joanna, played by Olivia Olson, through the airport at the end of the last film to declare his love.

"The London Dungeon tourist attraction has apologised for a promotional Twitter campaign that backfired. A graphic joking about a murdered sex worker, and another about infecting a partner with a sexually transmitted disease were posted on the attraction's Twitter feed. Critics said the collection of images was sexist and offensive. Merlin Entertainment said it was ""very sorry"" for the campaign and has deleted the tweets. The group said it had wanted to run a ""dark Valentine campaign"" to promote the London Dungeon, in which visitors are taken on a tour through London's dark history. Other messages in the series joked about sex acts, sex workers and body-shamed women But many Twitter users complained that many of the images tweeted were in poor taste and inappropriate for a family tourist attraction. Rebecca Reid, a columnist for the Telegraph, said: ""The biggest issue here is taking violence against women and turning it into a joke or a cheap marketing ploy."" She told the BBC: ""Just because these rapes and murders happened in the past doesn't mean they are fair game. ""Violence, rape and murder are all still a very brutal reality of life for modern day sex workers and these flippant tweets show no awareness or respect for that."" Merlin Entertainment said: ""Our brand tone of voice tends to divide audiences. However, we recognise that we've upset some people and for that we're very sorry.""

"Alicia Keys and John Legend appear in the new series Apple Music has delayed the launch of the new Carpool Karaoke TV series. It had originally been due to premiere this month but the companytold Reuters,externalit will now be ""later this year"". The delay seems a little odd as we know most of the series has already been filmed. But, let's be honest, judging by thefirst trailer,external, which was released in February, it will probably be worth waiting for. No reasons were given for the delay, which will see two celebrities paired up for a singalong session in each of its 16 episodes. The show was commissioned as a series in its own right after the regular Carpool Karaoke segments on The Late Late Show with James Corden proved hugely popular. Here are eight things we can expect from the show (when it arrives), judging by the trailer. 1. Carpool Karaoke no longer needs to be in a car. Or even on the ground Carpool Karaoke is no longer confined by silly little details like, you know, actually being in a car. ""This is the next level,"" says Will Smith, as he guides James Corden towards a waiting helicopter at one point in the trailer. Gravity schmavity. Appropriately, the first song they sing once they are in said aircraft is, of course, R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Reports that they also belted out a rendition of Westlife's Flying Without Wings could not be immediately confirmed. 2. Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane have zero time for parking restrictions At one point, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and singer and all-round awesome person Ariana Grande are shown standing by the parked car. Earlier in the trailer, they had been seen beautifully singing a song from The Little Shop of Horrors. All sweet and innocent and lovely. But look a little closer - and the plot takes a much darker turn. They appear to have pulled up across TWO disabled parking spaces. Ariana is going to have to give us at least six new masterpieces of Side To Side-level quality to redeem herself. 3. It's strange not having James Corden in the driver's seat Since the dawn of time, James Corden has been a ubiquitous presence in the driver's seat of the Carpool Karaoke automobile. Which is fair enough, since he basically came up with the idea when he firstclimbed into a car with George Michael,externalfor Comic Relief in 2011. But he's now allowed someone else to get behind the wheel, which gives us the extremely exciting prospect of episodes with five-piece bands. Or in this case, four-piece bands, plus a guest. The previous application form was limited to a maximum of four people, which allowed us Carpools featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and One Direction 2.0. But behold, now we have comedian Billy Eichner able to hitch a ride with Metallica (pictured). We're trying not to get our hopes up but this could technically pave the way for Little Mix giving Ozzy Osbourne a lift to Sainsbury's. 4. They may need a bigger car ""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" said someone once in some famous movie or other. In this case, the production team are perhaps going to need a bigger car for two of their more well-built guests. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and wrestler John Cena just about managed to squeeze in. Thank goodness it wasn't a Mini. 5. Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler are keen to get their five a day A slice of orange, a chunk of pineapple, a quarter of lime - it's fair to say country singer Blake Shelton and comic Chelsea Handler are fans of fruit. (Alternatively, it's possible that they're just fans of alcohol, served with fruit.) Of course, they could be hoping to become the faces of a new fruit and veg campaign, judging by this segment in the trailer. Because a slice of lemon in your drink counts towards your five a day. Doesn't it. Doesn't it? 6. A lot of people mistake John Legend for Pharrell Williams John Legend takes Alicia Keys and Hidden Figures actress Taraji P. Henson on a little spin in the new Carpool series, with the two singers seen belting out Alicia's Fallin'. (Tune.) But they also have a nice little chat, during which John Legend reveals that people often mistake him for somebody else. ""Old white women think I'm Pharrell [Williams] sometimes,"" he explains. He even briefly belts out the hook of Happy so as not to disappoint this particular fanbase. Maybe it goes both ways and Pharrell is regularly stopped by members of the public and asked for a quick blast of All of Me. 7. Wait. Go back a sec. Is that... a BRASS BAND? Yep. That's a 90-piece brass band. Being conducted from a sun roof by Will Smith. Who is leading them in a rendition of his 1997 treasure Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. I need to lie down. 8. Heavy metal sounds better in the dairy aisle First Blake and Chelsea hit the pub, and look, there's John Legend and Alicia Keys in a laundrette. Straight in at number one in the Look We Can Be Normal chart, however, is Metallica in a supermarket. If you haven't experienced Enter Sandman being performed next to the free range eggs, you've not heard Mozart the way it was meant to be played.

"Fester was found wandering the streets Abandoned because of his bizarre looks, Fester the boxer dog, who is blind in one eye and has a protruding lower jaw, has finally been found a new home. The one-year-old was handed in to the Dogs Trust near Darlington in December after being found wandering the streets as a stray. Following an appeal on social media, the canine with""a heart of gold""has found a new forever family. The trust said Fester would be leaving the charity's kennels early next week. Fester was born with a narrow jaw which causes his lower teeth to stick out - creating some ""unique features"", a trust spokeswoman said. ""We were concerned that fun-loving Fester may have ended up being over-looked by potential new owners due to his unusual eye-catching appearance,"" she added. ""He is a gorgeous boy with an amazing character, so we couldn't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to have him as part of their family.

"Tupperware parties are no longer polite gatherings over tea and cake, but have been updated to ""a girls' night out"" When I meet Tupperware Brands boss Rick Goings there's a funny moment. He's just finished his lunch, but wants to pack the remainder away for later. He looks expectantly at his colleague, expecting her to magic a box out of thin air. ""What, you think I've got some in my handbag?"" she scoffs. You can tell Mr Goings is slightly disappointed. The King of Tupperware hasn't got any at just the moment he needs some. Yet, despite being in Switzerland, thousands of miles away from the firm's headquarters in Orlando, Florida, it's not an unreasonable expectation that Tupperware's products may indeed be available. For while Tupperware may, in the UK at least, be forever associated with a bygone era when women stayed at home and men went to work, it's now a thriving international juggernaut. ""We do not look at ourselves as a US company,"" says Mr Goings. Rick Goings says the firm now targets countries ""where most of the people in the world live"" And you can see why.Sales last year,externalwere $2.2bn (Â£1.8bn) with Asia-Pacific responsible for almost a third of these, while the biggest sales growth was seen in Brazil. The firm's products - which now include not only Tupperware, but also several beauty brands - are sold in more than 80 countries, and for the past five years, more than 90% of sales have come from non-US markets. It's a revolution Mr Goings has driven. When he became chief executive in 1997, the firm had already expanded overseas, but was failing. In his first week at the helm he had to write off $100m of bad debt. ""So much was broken,"" he says about the company, founded in 1946 by inventor Earl Tupper. His solution was to ramp up the firm's expansion overseas, in particular focusing on Latin America, Asia and Africa and eventually taking the firm to more than 20 additional countries. He says this shift in focus was obvious, given that Europe and the US combined account for just a tenth of the world's population overall. ""We didn't have to make major changes to our business model and it's where most of the people in the world live,"" he says. A recommendation from a friend is always likely to be more persuasive than one from a company, according to McKinsey Many big consumer brands from Coca-Cola to Procter & Gamble have followed similar paths into emerging markets, tapping into a growing middle class and strong demand for well-known US brands. Yet Tupperware's model of direct selling - the famed suburban housewives' gathering of the 1950s and 1960s - is exactly the thing that has given it an edge. While easy to mock - do modern women really get excited about plastic boxes? - it's enabled the firm to get around all the problems of trying to sell in regions where infrastructure is less developed and shops can be a long distance away. The firm hasn't had to invest in shops, and instead of travelling into town, people can nip over to a friend's house to buy things. And while the party attendees may start off as housewives, they're unlikely to stay that way, according to Mr Goings. For many of the firm's 3.1 million casual sales consultants, it has provided their first chance of an independent income. Typically a party will yield about $400 (Â£320) worth of sales, of which the sales consultant will earn 30%. ""It's a heck of a lot of money,"" Mr Goings says. Working for Tupperware has enabled Indonesian Ng Chiu Gwek to educate her three children overseas Ng Chiu Gwek, one of Tupperware's most successful Indonesian sales force members, who joined the company in 1997, says she loves the firm. ""I have changed my own life into a better life, going from nothing into something,"" she says. Previously a full-time housewife, Ms Gwek - who was introduced to the firm by her mother-in-law - now runs a distributorship, responsible for a team of several thousand sales consultants in her hometown of Pontianak and the surrounding small cities. The job has enabled her to educate all three of her children overseas. ""Tupperware is my life and I have not seen any other company like Tupperware that has changed so many lives for the better,"" she says. A Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world every 1.3 seconds, the firm claims A shake-up of the party format has also helped drive growth. They are no longer polite gatherings over tea and cake, but have been updated to ""a girls' night out"", says Mr Goings with a conspiratorial nod. Themes include Mexican night with tequila, and decadent and delicious desserts and meals, with one such party held every 1.3 seconds globally, the firm claims. In some countries, where small homes mean space for hosting gatherings is limited, the firm has opened so-called ""experience studios"", where would-be customers can see the products in action. In China it has 5,600 such spaces, but reckons there's capacity for 20,000. The firm's sales model has another advantage. A recommendation from a friend is always likely to be more persuasive than one from a company, but in emerging markets this is particularly so, according to McKinsey. The management consultancy found,externalconsumers in Africa and Asia were far more dependent on word of mouth, than their developed counterparts. It said this was because with few brands around long enough to have built a loyal following, seeing a friend use a product was reassuring. It's also tough for counterfeiters - and those making cheaper imitations of the products - to imitate this kind of sales network. The firm's airtight storage boxes that wowed Western consumers in the postwar years now account for just a third of sales Neil Saunders, managing director at consultancy Globaldata Retail, says while in developed markets like the UK the firm's long history means Tupperware is seen as a bit old-fashioned compared to more modern rivals such as Joseph Joseph, in emerging markets it doesn't carry this ""baggage"". ""For consumers there it's a modern innovative brand. It's a challenger and innovator,"" he says. And as Mr Goings is at pains to point out while handing me the firm's brochure, the airtight storage boxes that wowed Western consumers in the postwar years now account for just a third of sales. Instead it is now brightly coloured microwaveable pressure cookers, mini food processors and water bottles that are driving sales. ""The party has changed, the product has changed. We're not just a plastic box company,"" he says.

"Students at Concordia University in Montreal, the top ranked world city for students Montreal has been named as the best city in the world for students. This international ranking of university cities has seen Paris slip from first place - a position the French capital has held for four years. The Canadian city has come top of theQS Best Student Cities,external, a spin-off from the annual QS World University Rankings. It will add to suggestions that Canada will attract a bigger slice of the lucrative international student market, particularly if there are concerns about changes to entry rules under President Trump. It also has the benefit of being able to offer degree courses in two big international languages - with English-speaking universities such as McGill University, and French-speaking, such as the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al. Entry to this league table requires cities to have at least a population of 250,000 and to be home to at least two universities in the World University Rankings. The rankings are based on a basket of measures - including the quality of universities, facilities for students, affordability, the ""desirability"" of the city for students, access to employers, the international nature of a city, levels of tolerance, pollution and safety. Canada is seen as high on desirability for international students - with Montreal in top place and Vancouver in 10th and Toronto in 11th place. Ben Sowter, head of the QS Intelligence Unit which produces the ranking, forecasts that Canada's growing popularity will be part of an increase in ""alternatives to the traditionally dominant study destinations, both in Europe and North America"". ""Canada will become a major player,"" forecasts Mr Sowter. Canada could attract students from the US, and the UK could lose students to Ireland, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, he says. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. A spokeswoman for the city of Montreal says there has already been a surge of international students - with big rises in student numbers from China, India, France and Iran. Figures from admissions services in the UK have already shown a 7% fall in applications from EU students - and UK universities have been worried that the backwash of Brexit will leave the UK looking less welcoming to overseas students. But there are no signs of an adverse impact on London in this year's rankings, moving up from fifth place to third. London continues to have a strong appeal for students, according to this ranking The two great world cities of London and Paris are in the top three best places to study - able to offer both a rich cultural as well as academic experience. Along with Boston, which can claim Harvard, MIT and Boston University, London and Paris are boosted by the strength and number of top universities. The slip from first to second place for Paris is attributed to cost and a loss in desirability, including safety. Mr Sowter rejects a link to terror attacks in the French capital - saying that when students are surveyed only a handful of cities are seen as more attractive than Paris. He says students seem to be resilient to accepting there are no ""zero risk"" cities - whether it is Boston, Berlin or Paris, all of which have maintained their attraction. London's universities rate highly on quality - ""no city has a superior variety and quality of universities to London"" - and the falling value of the pound after the EU referendum has improved their affordability for overseas students. Edinburgh is Scotland's highest ranked university in 18th place. Apart from Canada, the only other country with two cities in the top 10 is Germany, with Berlin and Munich. This reflects Germany's financial advantages for overseas students - who do not have to pay any tuition fees. Montreal and other Canadian universities have been offering an alternative to the US The most affordable cities of all, taking into account living costs, were Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Surabaya in Indonesia. Stockholm in Sweden and New York in the US were the most expensive. Asian countries - particularly China and India - provide the biggest cohorts of overseas students. But Asian countries are becoming big magnets in their own right, with five cities in the top 20, headed by Seoul, which has risen to fourth place. Shanghai is the highest rated city in China in 25th place, with Mumbai the highest in India in 85th place. The competition for attracting international students is big business. The US remains the biggest market and annual figures show that for the first time more than a million overseas students were at US universities - with almost 330,000 from China alone. Apart from the benefits from international research partnerships - and the long-term influence of soft power - such international students are officially estimated at being worth almost $36bn (Â£29bn) to the US economy. Being able to attract more of these valuable students makes these rankings much more than a civic beauty contest. QS Best Student Cities 2017 1. Montreal 2. Paris 3. London 4. Seoul 5. Melbourne 6.

"The long-awaited public inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police could be delayed for years amid a growing legal row with Scotland Yard. Newly-published documents reveal the Metropolitan Police is questioning the unprecedented size of the probe. It says it needs months to assess which former officers need their identities protected - and does not believe all of them should give evidence. Public evidence hearings may not now start before 2018. Sir Christopher Pitchford, the inquiry's chairman, says he needs to hear from all the officers. The new delays have emerged a week after the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it wasinvestigating whether a Metropolitan Police unit shredded a large number of filesthat were relevant to the inquiry. Theresa May, then home secretary, ordered the inquiry in 2015 after serious allegations against undercover officers. She told Sir Christopher to report back by July 2018, something that is now impossible. Undercover inquiry: The key allegations Miscarriages of justice, Sexual relationships with women they were targeting Using false identities taken from dead babies and children Claims the campaign supporting Stephen Lawrence's family had been infiltrated Undercover inquiry: Why it matters Documents published by the inquiry,externalon Wednesday reveal months of tension building between its team and the Metropolitan Police over what the force should hand over. Scotland Yard says it has so far disclosed one million pages and identified 116 surviving former undercover officers from the Special Demonstration Squad, the disbanded unit at the heart of many of the allegations. The inquiry wants all of them to give evidence but Scotland Yard says that is unworkable because of the ""immense"" pressures it is under. In detailed submissions to the inquiry, it says that the demands for evidence dating back 40 years are unprecedented. It is already spending the equivalent of 80 police constables' salaries on the inquiry and may need to have more than 100 officers and staff working full time. ""The Metropolitan Police Service recognises that a number of deployments [undercover operations] will be properly subjected to close scrutiny by the inquiry,"" says one of the force's letters. ""This does not mean however that each deployment will need to be subject to the same depth of review. Many officers are reluctant to engage with the inquiry process."" In a further twist, the documents reveal Scotland Yard proposed that an unnamed detective sergeant would explain to the inquiry how it was managing secret documents even though the officer had been accused of destroying files on the Green Party peer Baroness Jenny Jones. The officer has since been cleared of wrongdoing but the inquiry has insisted the individual cannot give evidence. Can an inquiry into secrets ever be public? Undercover police: 'Deception overseen by state' In his response to the Met's plea for a delay, Sir Christopher said the Metropolitan Police would need to explain at a special hearing in April how the inquiry could work if it did not hear from all the former undercover officers. ""Their evidence is clearly relevant,"" he says. ""The Inquiry needs to see that evidence... it might have been otherwise if the Inquiry could be confident that the documentary records of the Special Demonstration Squad were fully preserved, but they were not. ""It seems to me clear that there is no reasonable prospect that the Inquiry will complete its work within the three year period originally envisaged in July 2015, and that it is unlikely that evidence hearings will take place in 2017.""

"The death of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, dominates the front pages of the day's papers. The Metro leads with the story,externalof how the exile was apparently murdered by a woman pressing a cloth to his face at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Daily Telegraph carries a grim rundown,externalof how Kim Jong-un has ""silenced his enemies"", employing a range of weapons from flame-throwers to anti-aircraft guns to have his enemies dispatched. In its obituary, the paper also reports that Kim Jong-nam had a lonely childhood and was allowed only one, much older friend. His large playroom is said to have been restocked each year with toys bought overseas by members of his father's personal security staff. Kim Jong-nam (left), the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (right), was living in exile in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia In an analysis piece,the Guardian,externalsays the death of Kim Jong-nam fits well into the ""comic-book"" depiction of North Korea as a ""bizarre hermit kingdom, ruled by a murderous, whimsical, paranoid and overweight tyrant"". But it says Kim Jong-un's dictatorship is no joke. The paper believes he may have been emboldened to take action against a relative when Donald Trump described Vladimir Putin as a ""killer"" whom he nevertheless respected. The Times leads with a warning,externalthat the first overhaul of business rates for seven years is likely to bring a tax cut for the internet giant, Amazon, while leaving high-street stores facing large increases. The paper says the review will create big winners and losers because the revaluations of premises are linked to property prices. That means internet-based retailers like Amazon will benefit, as they have many vast warehouses in low-growth regions. In contrast, firms which have shops in booming urban areas are more likely to suffer. The Daily Telegraph,externalhas a different focus on the business rates review. It says the changes will leave NHS hospitals and GP surgeries in England and Wales facing a rates rise of Â£635m over five years. The Nuffield Trust think-tank tells the paper that hospitals will struggle to absorb the increases, and may have to look at their staffing levels. The UKIP leader, Paul Nuttall, has more questions to answer about the Hillsborough disaster,according to the Guardian.,external Mr Nuttall apologised yesterday when it emerged that his own website had incorrectly quoted him as saying he'd lost close friends when fans were crushed in the stadium. The Guardian says UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has more questions to answer about the Hillsborough disaster The paper carries interviews with the families of some of the 96 fans who died as a result of Hillsborough. One accuses the politician of using one of the dead ""for his own personal publicity"". Another urges Mr Nuttall to provide further evidence that he was in the crowd at Hillsborough, as he has long said. Government ministers are to reject plans for a deposit scheme for plastic bottles,according to the Daily Mail,,externaldespite evidence the initiative could ""slash litter and boost recycling"". The paper says it's dismayed by the news, after fighting to get rid of single-use plastic bags. It says similar initiatives in other countries have given children a strong incentive to pick up litter, instead of dropping it. The Mail argues that the time for a deposit scheme has come - and the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, should take note.

"This video can not be played Philip Pullman talks exclusively to Radio 4's Today about the release of the ""equel"" to His Dark Materials Author Philip Pullman has announced the publication of the long-awaited follow-up to his best-selling His Dark Materials series of novels. The new trilogy is called The Book of Dust and the first novel will come out in October, 17 years after the last instalment. He says the books are an ""equel"", rather than a prequel or sequel. The His Dark Materials trilogy sold more than 17.5 million copies and was translated into 40 languages. The series will return to the story of Lyra Belacqua, and will begin when the heroine is a baby, and move on to when she is 20 years old. ""People say, 'Is it prequel? Is it a sequel?' Well, it is neither,"" said Mr Pullman,speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""It's an 'equel'. It's a different story which begins roughly 10 years before His Dark Materials and ends roughly 10 years after."" Actress Dakota Blue Richards played Lyra Belacqua in the 2007 film The Golden Compass, based on the first book in the His Dark Materials series In a separate interview Mr Pullman said: ""I know from their letters and tweets that my readers have been waiting patiently (mostly) for The Book of Dust for a long time. ""It gives me great pleasure and some excitement at last to satisfy their curiosity (and mine) about this book. ""At the centre of The Book Of Dust is the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organisation, which wants to stifle speculation and inquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free."" The writer is not giving away any plot details, but has dropped some hints about what the new books could contain, saying that ""an ordinary boy"" featured in an early part of the story would return as a key character. Mr Pullman's last His Dark Materials book was published in October 2000, and the first volume of the new series will come out on Thursday 19 October. The original trilogy - Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass - is currently being adapted by the BBC. There was also a 2004 National Theatre adaptation and a 2007 film, The Golden Compass, which was adapted from first book Northern Lights, and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The first book was retitled The Golden Compass in North America.

"Professional footballers can perform dozens of headers during a match, and hundreds more over a week's training - adding up to tens of thousands of blows to the head over their career. Scientists now say that repeated blows to the head from headers may belinked to long-term brain damage. The research examined the brains of six players renowned for headers - all of whom developed dementia in later life. Here, players and coaches share their reactions. Ian St John (left) and his Liverpool teammates celebrate their FA Cup Final victory in 1965 Ian St John, who played for Liverpool between 1961-71, says six of his teammates - from a group of about 16 players - now have Alzheimer's. ""For people of my vintage, I would say all the facts that we have got, stand up,"" he told theVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""And I don't know why the FA and the PFA have covered this up for years. ""I talked about it to the PFA a couple of years ago, and their answer was: 'Well, women get dementia, so therefore it's not an industrial injury'. Which is a load of nonsense isn't it? ""I don't know about today's light ball, but in our era, heading that heavy ball day in and day out - not just at matches but training as well - the lads know at this stage of their lives we're either dying or have dementia. ""The footballs that we've been heading for years are causing this, but they're [the FA] in denial about it. ""How many goalkeepers have got dementia over the years? If they did a survey, it would be interesting if the answer was none, which means that the goalkeeper - the only guy on the field who is not heading the ball on the field - is OK."" Former striker Kevin Davies says he may have performed up to 50,000 headers during his career Former England striker Kevin Davies says contact sportsmen know there's always going to be a risk, but more research needs to be done. ""I'm well renowned for heading the ball and we used to get all the stats back - during the game it can be between 25 and 40 times. ""When you start to look at the numbers in terms of professional players, the amount of contact they have with the ball - if you look at my career, 800 career games, and then you take into training, the numbers start to stack up and it could be anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 times that you're heading the ball. ""The ball has changed a lot, the training methods have changed a lot now. ""[Previously] you'd see some sessions where you were hurling balls at defenders and it was a bit scary at the time - I think that has changed a lot and the style of football has changed a lot but there needs to be more research with the new footballs."" The former SFA chief executive believes a ban on heading for under-12s will come into effect Gordon Smith, former Scottish Football Association chief executive, says he expects youth football to ban headers. ""Certainly, I know, I'm an ambassador of the Scottish Youth FA in Scotland and they're looking at it because they understand what's happened in America regarding the banning of kids heading the ball from 11 downwards. ""I see football at the younger level and because now the game has changed from 11-a-side up until they're 12 years old to seven-a-side games, the ball is very rarely ever in the air. The kids aren't heading the ball as much as they used to - there's no doubt about that. ""And the secondary aspect of it is that from Ian [St John's] day, the ball has improved a lot - they were very, very heavy. I think a lot of the damage was done because of those types of balls. And people were doing a lot of heading backwards - there's no doubt about it. ""I think that ban [on young players heading] will come to this country soon. I would say that from 12 years downwards there should definitely be no heading the ball at all. ""You can imagine sometime in the future they might be a scenario where each player has to sign a disclaimerâ¦to say that if I'm playing football I am taking this risk."" Youth coach Nathan Sargeson says training sessions should limit the amount of headers Nathan Sargeson, lead football coach with Little Lions football club in East Lancashire, says children rarely perform headers. He says: ""The latest footballs that are used have come a long way and the technology around the ball - where it's more synthetic leather, rather than the solid leather casing. ""But it's like Kevin [Davies] said; in grassroots football you don't see a lot of kids heading the ball - it's really how much is done at training. ""Obviously you've got to limit that amount and think about it - and obviously with the findings and the studies, you've got to take it all into account.""

"This video can not be played A brief guide to Basil Kirchin's music Basil Kirchin was a maverick musician and pioneering composer who is credited as a founding father of ambient music. Yet despite being hailed by acts such as Brian Eno and St Etienne, he remains an obscure figure. Now a festival in Hull is casting a light on a man regarded by many musicians as a genius. In the early 2000s, in a recording studio in Hull, saxophonist Alan Barnes found himself engaged in a particularly odd performance. ""One day Basil said 'I want you to do a duet' and I said 'who with?',"" he recalled. ""He said 'with Hitler'."" Lo and behold, one week later he found himself ""screaming on the bass clarinet at Hitler coming out of a speaker at me"" with Kirchin recording it. ""Dueting with Hitler is the weirdest thing you can get really,"" added Barnes. ""But anything could happen with Basil."" Kirchin, who died in Hull in 2005, was an eccentric. He was also a radical innovator whose 1971 record Worlds Within Worlds is often cited as the first ambient album - a genre characterised by its focus on mood and atmosphere rather than traditional song structures. He pioneered techniques which are now commonplace but were considered radical at the time. These included recording sounds he came across and then cutting, splicing, slowing down or stretching the tape to create strange, new noises. Perhaps predictably, this radical approach did not lead to commercial success. Worlds Within Worlds only sold a few hundred copies upon its release on Columbia Records. However, Richard Williams, who subsequently signed Kirchin to Island Records in the early 1970s for a follow up, was not put off by this. ""It wasn't going to be a chart album... but I thought it was worth doing because it was pioneering, experimental and a product of a really interesting man,"" he said. Brian Eno wrote the sleeve notes for Kirchin's Worlds Within Worlds volume two album When Kirchin released another Worlds Within Worlds record in 1974, Williams asked a young Brian Eno to write the liner notes. Eno, who would later popularise the ambient genre with his 1978 album Ambient 1, was more than happy to oblige. ""He was always interested in the new and the experimental so I played him Basil's music and said would you like to write something for the sleeve of the album,"" he said. ""He was very, very enthusiastic and keen and did indeed write something. ""I know that Basil's music certainly affected the way he was thinking, and it was interesting to hear that somebody else was thinking in the same direction that he was."" But while Eno achieved fame through his work with Roxy Music and later collaborations with David Bowie, Kirchin continued operating on the edges of the music industry. This video can not be played Basil Kirchin explains his controversial use of autistic children's voices His subsequent projects and albums, including Abstractions of the Industrial North, Quantum and Particles, all characterise his unique approach and his eccentric personality, but achieved precious little commercial success. Kirchin's musical career began in 1941 when, aged 13, he joined his father's big band as a drummer. The Blackpool-born youngster took to London's Paramount Theatre, where the Ivor Kirchin band had a long-term residency. He spent many nights sleeping in a Tube station as the Blitz erupted above. After the war he continued his jazz career, leading the Kirchin band and touring the UK with singer Sarah Vaughan. The band garnered a number of famous fans - including Sean Connery - but Kirchin grew tired of that scene and decided to travel to India in search of spiritual fulfilment. The Ivor Kirchin Band, with Basil on drums, toured the UK and had long-term residencies in London and Hull In the 1950s, he spent time at the Ramakrishna Temple on the banks of the River Ganges, 10 years before The Beatles' famous trip to the subcontinent. ""He turned his back on the music business in the late 50s because he was on a spiritual quest really,"" said Matt Stephenson, director of Nova Studios, which has made a feature-length documentary on Kirchin. ""He got ideas about music and sound and about life that he wanted to find out more about, they mattered to him more than fame and success."" Kirchin played drums with British jazz heavyweights Ted Heath and Harry Roy Kirchin's travels ended when, on a trip to Australia, the tapes containing the Kirchin Band's entire back catalogue fell from a luggage net into the sea. After that traumatic experience, he returned to England, shuttling between London and Hull, where his father's band had a permanent residency. It was here that Kirchin met sound engineer Keith Herd in a music shop. ""He had a black Mackintosh, he had very long hair and beard and it was 'blimey who's this?',"" recalls Herd. Keith Herd became lifelong friends with Kirchin after first meeting in the 1960s in a music shop in Hull Together, working in Herd's studio, they helped develop the techniques that would produce Kirchin's radical new sound. He created a series of soundtracks for imaginary films before film producer David Greene recruited him to provide scores for The Abominable Dr Phibes, I Start Counting and The Shuttered Room. At around the same time Kirchin delved deeper into the foray of tape manipulation and sound experimentation, giving birth to his innovative Worlds Within Worlds series. Among the sounds he recorded - and manipulated - were those of autistic children. He was living in Switzerland with his Swiss wife Esther, who was a teacher at a school which catered specifically for autistic pupils. Kirchin explained his reasons in a BBC Radio 3 interview in 2003, describing how he was ""fascinated by the sounds these children make when they're trying to communicate"". ""No normal, with the greatest respect, human mind could think of such intervals as they pitch and sing... it's emotional,"" he said. Kirchin's wife Esther worked as a teacher at a school for autistic children in Switzerland where he taped their voices, which he later manipulated The school was in the Swiss valley of Zermatt Many years later, a new wave of musicians and artists began discovering his work. Tim Gane, of Stereolab, said his thirst for the experimental and avant-garde led him to Kirchin's records in the early 1980s. ""To me it's experimental, it's also groovy, very wistful, a flowing kind of melodicism which is really unusual, unique to Basil Kirchin's music and it has an identifiable kind of charm about the chords and about the instruments chosen - harpsichord and flutes... ""It's quite exotic, very nice arrangements and very modern melodies. It doesn't sound really like it was done in the mid-60s."" Sean O'Hagan and Tim Gane say they have both been left inspired by Kirchin's music Former Stereolab stalwart Sean O'Hagan, now of The High Llamas, describes Kirchin's music as being ""very instinctive"". ""It felt very real, very odd and slightly dangerous. ""It brought me to very odd areas - noisy experimental, totally unmusical forays but also very lyrical songs and some absolutely beautiful film music."" Bob Stanley, of St Etienne, recalls first coming across Kirchin's music in the mid-1990s with a track titled Mind on The Run. ""It's a terrific bit of music. It sounded like possibly something from the Avengers, like a chase scene or something, there's that really frenetic drumming and organ work. It's a great piece of music."" St Etienne's Bob Stanley interviewed Kirchin in 2003 For Kirchin, his unusual sounds and recording techniques were linked to his spiritual beliefs. ""He believed there are several universes going on at the same time,"" said Stanley, who interviewed Kirchin in 2003. ""So, like a fly's world is completely different to our world, it moves at a completely different speed. ""And therefore if you speed up or slow down sound you can find a way into these parallel universes."" Basil Kirchin lived in a council house off Hessle Road in Hull, where he spent the latter years of his life By the end of the 1990s, Kirchin was living an impoverished lifestyle in a two-up-two-down council house with his wife in Hull. However, he continued to produce music with the help of Iain Firth, a young engineering graduate, and paid session musicians with his dole money and royalties. At the same time, his material had been rediscovered by jazz enthusiast Jonny Trunk, who released a number of Kirchin's tracks on his eponymous record label at the turn of the millennium. But by this point Kirchin had become very ill with cancer. ""It was difficult to see him deteriorating and it was sad to see,"" recounts Firth. ""It made me really determined to do my best for him."" Engineer Iain Firth worked with Basil Kirchin from the early 2000s until his death in 2005 Three months before he lost his battle with cancer, Trunk interviewed Kirchin in his kitchen in Hull. ""He was great, he was thrilled to be rediscovered,"" he said. ""He had cancer of everything: he had one eye, he was in a very poor, physical state. ""He was full of the most extraordinary energy and passion, [it was] really amazing to experience that sort of raw energy that he had, even in that state where most people would've given up."" For Barnes, Kirchin's last days were difficult to witness. ""He had this horrible tumour behind his eye so he was visually quite startling,"" he recalls. ""Later on he had it removed. Me and Bruce Adams went to do a session, he answered the door and half his face wasn't there, which was a hell of a shock. It was terrifying and nothing had prepared us for that. ""But typical of him he was just carrying on as if nothing had happened... that was the last time, it was just before he died."" Bruce Adams and Alan Barnes (right) were among a number of session musicians who worked with Kirchin. Others included the legendary Jimmy Page and Mick Ronson, before they became famous More than 10 years after his death, Kirchin's achievements are now being publicly recognised at a festival in Hull celebrating his life and work. ""Some of his music's pretty difficult,"" says Trunk. ""Worlds Within Worlds is possibly one of the most radical, hardcore records you could ever, ever hear in your life. ""When I first heard Quantum I thought the house was on fire. No one ever did anything like that until him."" Writer and BBC broadcaster Stuart Maconie, also a Kirchin enthusiast, echoes Trunk's sentiments, saying Kirchin was very much ""operating on the margins of music"". ""I think there are people out there whose palates are a bit jaded and are looking for something more interesting. ""Basil's stuff will sometimes frighten you, unsettle you. ""Some of the stuff with the autistic kids - it makes you feel slightly unsettled for all kinds of reasons. You think is this exploitative almost, you think 'what's going on here?'. ""But that's good I think."" Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs of Saint Etienne are among the musicians performing at the Basil Kirchin festival, which runs from 17 to 19 February For Stanley, Kirchin's musical philosophy and innovative techniques made him ""without a doubt the most inspiring person I'd ever met"". ""When he was doing it, it was almost impossible. He had to use special equipment made in Switzerland to try and do it.

"Alicia Keys and John Legend appear in the new series Apple Music has delayed the launch of the new Carpool Karaoke TV series. It had originally been due to premiere this month but the companytold Reuters,externalit will now be ""later this year"". The delay seems a little odd as we know most of the series has already been filmed. But, let's be honest, judging by thefirst trailer,external, which was released in February, it will probably be worth waiting for. No reasons were given for the delay, which will see two celebrities paired up for a singalong session in each of its 16 episodes. The show was commissioned as a series in its own right after the regular Carpool Karaoke segments on The Late Late Show with James Corden proved hugely popular. Here are eight things we can expect from the show (when it arrives), judging by the trailer. 1. Carpool Karaoke no longer needs to be in a car. Or even on the ground Carpool Karaoke is no longer confined by silly little details like, you know, actually being in a car. ""This is the next level,"" says Will Smith, as he guides James Corden towards a waiting helicopter at one point in the trailer. Gravity schmavity. Appropriately, the first song they sing once they are in said aircraft is, of course, R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Reports that they also belted out a rendition of Westlife's Flying Without Wings could not be immediately confirmed. 2. Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane have zero time for parking restrictions At one point, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and singer and all-round awesome person Ariana Grande are shown standing by the parked car. Earlier in the trailer, they had been seen beautifully singing a song from The Little Shop of Horrors. All sweet and innocent and lovely. But look a little closer - and the plot takes a much darker turn. They appear to have pulled up across TWO disabled parking spaces. Ariana is going to have to give us at least six new masterpieces of Side To Side-level quality to redeem herself. 3. It's strange not having James Corden in the driver's seat Since the dawn of time, James Corden has been a ubiquitous presence in the driver's seat of the Carpool Karaoke automobile. Which is fair enough, since he basically came up with the idea when he firstclimbed into a car with George Michael,externalfor Comic Relief in 2011. But he's now allowed someone else to get behind the wheel, which gives us the extremely exciting prospect of episodes with five-piece bands. Or in this case, four-piece bands, plus a guest. The previous application form was limited to a maximum of four people, which allowed us Carpools featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and One Direction 2.0. But behold, now we have comedian Billy Eichner able to hitch a ride with Metallica (pictured). We're trying not to get our hopes up but this could technically pave the way for Little Mix giving Ozzy Osbourne a lift to Sainsbury's. 4. They may need a bigger car ""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" said someone once in some famous movie or other. In this case, the production team are perhaps going to need a bigger car for two of their more well-built guests. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and wrestler John Cena just about managed to squeeze in. Thank goodness it wasn't a Mini. 5. Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler are keen to get their five a day A slice of orange, a chunk of pineapple, a quarter of lime - it's fair to say country singer Blake Shelton and comic Chelsea Handler are fans of fruit. (Alternatively, it's possible that they're just fans of alcohol, served with fruit.) Of course, they could be hoping to become the faces of a new fruit and veg campaign, judging by this segment in the trailer. Because a slice of lemon in your drink counts towards your five a day. Doesn't it. Doesn't it? 6. A lot of people mistake John Legend for Pharrell Williams John Legend takes Alicia Keys and Hidden Figures actress Taraji P. Henson on a little spin in the new Carpool series, with the two singers seen belting out Alicia's Fallin'. (Tune.) But they also have a nice little chat, during which John Legend reveals that people often mistake him for somebody else. ""Old white women think I'm Pharrell [Williams] sometimes,"" he explains. He even briefly belts out the hook of Happy so as not to disappoint this particular fanbase. Maybe it goes both ways and Pharrell is regularly stopped by members of the public and asked for a quick blast of All of Me. 7. Wait. Go back a sec. Is that... a BRASS BAND? Yep. That's a 90-piece brass band. Being conducted from a sun roof by Will Smith. Who is leading them in a rendition of his 1997 treasure Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. I need to lie down. 8. Heavy metal sounds better in the dairy aisle First Blake and Chelsea hit the pub, and look, there's John Legend and Alicia Keys in a laundrette. Straight in at number one in the Look We Can Be Normal chart, however, is Metallica in a supermarket. If you haven't experienced Enter Sandman being performed next to the free range eggs, you've not heard Mozart the way it was meant to be played.

"The new Â£5 note will not be withdrawn, despite concerns that it contains traces of animal fat, the Bank of England says. The Bank said it had concluded it would be ""appropriate"" to keep the Â£5 polymer note in circulation. It will also issue the Â£10 polymer note as planned in September, it added. Vegans and some religious groups had voiced concerns, as the note contains a small amount of tallow, which is derived from meat products. Apetition,externalto ban the note attracted more than 100,000 signatures. The Bank said it treated ""the concerns raised by members of the public with the utmost seriousness"". However, the central bank also emphasised that ""an extremely small amount of tallow"" was used at an early stage of producing the polymer pellets, which were then used to create the notes. This video can not be played Five facts about the new Winston Churchill fiver The Bank is still working with its polymer supplier to ""determine what alternatives might be available"" for the current Â£5 note and the Jane Austen Â£10 polymer note. It said it had spent Â£46m on printing the Â£5 note, and Â£24m so far on printing 275 million of the new Â£10 notes. ""Reprinting these notes on a new substrate would mean incurring these costs again. It would also require a further Â£50,000 for the secure destruction of the existing stock,"" the Bank added. The petition against the Â£5 note, hosted on the change.org website, stated that tallow was ""unacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK"". A number of Sikhs and Hindushave also called for the notes to be banned from temples, where meat products are forbidden. Hindus believe cows are holy and sacred, and many do not wear shoes or carry bags made from the skin of cattle that has been slaughtered. Practising Sikhs are strict vegetarians.

"The days of the three-hour, five-bottle City lunch appear to be well and truly over after Lloyd's of London introduced a booze ban. The insurance market has told its 800 employees that they are not allowed to drink alcohol between 09:00 and 17:00. Lloyd's said it had been considering the move for some time to bring it into line with ""industry norms"". The ban applies to Lloyd's staff, not brokers and underwriters doing business in the historic insurance market. But angry staff have called the new measures ""heavy-handed"". Workers took to Lloyd's intranet to air their grievances, with one asking: ""Will we be asked to go to bed earlier soon?"" According to the London Evening Standard, another asked: ""Did I just wake up from my drunken induced slumber to find we are now living in Orwell's 1984?"" This video can not be played Last orders for ""boozy lunches"" in The City? The boozy lunch had long been a staple of City life when deals were done and contacts made. A spokesman for Lloyd's said: ""There is no denying that it has traditionally been part and parcel of this type of business."" In an internal memo to staff, Lloyd's said an examination of grievance and disciplinary cases over the last two years found that about half were related to alcohol. A Lloyd's spokesman said that the market had changed and that Lloyd's wanted to attract younger people to the industry. He added that Lloyd's wanted to bring its employee guide into line with other companies, such as QBE, which advises staff not to drink as opposed to an outright ban. He said that if someone was found to have broken the rule, their manager will decide on the best course of action to take.

"""When I started 10 years ago it was pretty quiet."" In a light, airy office on the ground floor of Europol's brutalist headquarters in The Hague, David Ellero, one of its senior officials, is reflecting on how the organisation has changed since he joined in 2007. In those days, some people confused Europol with Interpol and others thought it was just an annoying part of the EU's bureaucratic machinery. ""Our counterparts, or the investigators in the member states, didn't really know what we did,"" Ellero says. Now, the European Police Office, to give it its official title, is recognised across the law enforcement world, with a budget of almost Â£100m, and a workforce of more than 1000, to match. Its effectiveness certainly isn't lost on the UK government, which is preparing to start negotiations about Britain's role in Europol after the country leaves the EU. Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, has said that the agency plays an ""incredibly important role in keeping us safe in Europe"". ""The phone rings quite often,"" says Ellero, with typical understatement. A former detective - much of his career was spent in Italy investigating Mafia killings - he now heads a department tackling the top organised crime groups across the Continent. ""For a criminal to communicate with his counterparts across Europe it takes a second on WhatsApp. Europol headquarters in The Hague - the second floor is a ""secure zone"" ""We need to make sure that... police (can act) at the same speed even if they have different judicial set-ups and and even if they speak different languages,"" adds Ellero, pointing out that ""even pickpockets"" operate transnationally. The main function of Europol, which started work in 1999, is to act as a hub for the exchange of intelligence between 750 global agencies. It also oversees databases containing tens of millions of pieces of information on criminals, offences and suspect vehicles, and it helps co-ordinate crime-fighting operations against drug dealers, human trafficking gangs and terrorists. Forty countries - including the EU member states and others such as the US and Australia - communicate via a system called Siena - hundreds of thousands of encrypted operational messages are sent every year. The agency's main intelligence database - Europol Information System (EIS) - keeps track of crimes, suspects and convicted criminals, including terrorism cases. Only Europol members have direct access to the EIS; other countries must put in a request. Europol uses a unique database known as the Analysis Work File (AWF). More than 100 specialists based in The Hague use AWF to help investigators across the EU better understand and tackle crime and organised crime groups - the system has more than 33 million active entries. Outside Europol, other pan-European intelligence systems help in the fight against crime including the Schengen Information System (SIS). Although the UK is not among the 26 countries that have open borders under the Schengen agreement it can access the database which records cross-border movements and associated intelligence. In 2015, the SIS was interrogated three billion times by law enforcement officers across Europe with 64 million ""alerts"" placed on the system every day relating to everything from stolen vehicles and missing children to foreign fighters returning to Europe from Syria and Iraq.  Indeed, one of the fastest-growing areas of work at Europol involves countering the spread of propaganda from terrorist groups and extremists. A 26-strong team in the Internet Referral Unit spends each day combing the web for material and then persuading social media companies and service providers to remove it. The head of the unit, Vincent Semestre, likens it to ""emptying the ocean with a spoon"". He says they've identified 91 internet platforms that have contained extremist content, more than 50 of which have co-operated with Europol in deleting the material. Over the past 18 months the team's most intense periods of work have come after terror attacks in Europe, when it's had to act quickly to prevent the spread of extremist images, videos and postings. ""You need to have capacity in-house, which is understanding this ideology in its original language: which means staff speaking Arabic, speaking Russian, speaking Turkish,"" says Semestre, who worked for the French judicial police before joining Europol. The European Cybercrime Centre is just one part of Europol ""Multiplying these resources needed by all the member states would be quite difficult. ""You need to have continuous monitoring of the technological environment so it made sense to have this centralised in Europol in order to provide these centralised services to all the member states,"" he adds. UK warned it could lose access to Europol intelligence Amber Rudd urged to sign new Europol protocol Despite the serious nature of their work, there's a relaxed and friendly atmosphere inside the Europol building - it looks more like an art college than a police station. Nevertheless, security is tight: everyone is searched on entry, bags are X-rayed, identity documents are taken away to be checked. Around the atrium, blinds are drawn on the windows of meeting rooms, signifying that confidential briefings are taking place. On the second floor, there's another layer of protection, with extra ID checks and access possible only via a palm print scanner. It's known as the ""secure zone"" and it's here, and on the floors above, that each of the EU's member states, plus 14 other countries, have their own staff. In total, there are more than 200 of them - they're called liaison officers - and they specialise in crimes such as gun-running, trafficking and drug smuggling. Every EU member state, plus 14 other nations, has staff in the building The main benefit is that representatives of each country can meet in person to sort out the complexities of cross-border police work. For Britain's 17 liaison officers, who work from an office which neighbours the bureaux of Luxembourg, the Republic of Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, an added advantage is that the language of Europol is English. Kenny Dron, who's in charge of the UK office, says there's no need for long-distance phone calls, texts... or emails. ""Emails just don't work when you've got people to protect and lives to protect back in the UK,"" says Dron, who's spent 30 years in border policing and intelligence work. ""So you've got to have that face-to-face contact to ensure that the other country and your colleagues understand the severity of the situation."" Although Britain will almost certainly continue to have liaison officers at Europol after Brexit (America isn't in the EU and it has more than 20 staff based there) what's far less clear is the future of the 50 other UK law enforcement employees in the Hague. They're currently overseeing a range of cross-border policing operations, on child sexual exploitation, excise fraud and heroin trafficking, among others. One of the British officers, Laura Clark, seconded from the National Crime Agency to work in Europol's migrant smuggling centre, says it would be a ""real shame"" if Britain can't continue to play a major part in the organisation. ""We would miss a lot of the intelligence that goes through. There's a lot of juicy intelligence that I see that wouldn't be able to get given to countries, a lot of support for investigations wouldn't happen,"" she says. Europol director Rob Wainwright speaks of ""some diminution"" in the UK's rights and responsibilities to the organisation post-Brexit In January, reflecting on Britain's likely relationship with Europol after Brexit, Amber Rudd told the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee: ""I expect and hope us to have an active role going forward,"" pointing out that the UK was ""one of the largest contributors"" to the EU agency's database. Rob Wainwright, Europol's director since 2009, goes further, saying Britain is ""rightly regarded as a natural leader"" on security issues. ""There is no doubt that if you look over the last 20 or 30 years the evolution of police co-operation in Europe, not just at Europol, there is a heavy British footprint around that,"" says Wainwright, who declares himself to be a ""proud Brit"". But he says the ""fullest benefits"" of the organisation go to EU-member states, and if, after Brexit, Britain has an arrangement with Europol akin to that of non-members such as the USA or Norway, Wainwright says there'll be ""some diminution"" in the UK's rights and responsibilities. They have limited access to intelligence and less say over operations and decisions. ""The opportunity therefore to share that experience, the opportunity to leverage that influence, is going to change and maybe diminish and I think those in charge of running that in Britain will need to find alternative ways therefore of making sure that Britain can still have a real voice in European security affairs,"" he says. By then, Rob Wainwright, who's credited with introducing reforms to Europol that have enhanced its standing and effectiveness, will have left the Hague headquarters, as his contract expires in April 2018. His successor will inherit an organisation in good shape - but one that will have to adjust to a different relationship with the UK.

"Donald Trump's willingness to build better relations with Russia is threatening to turn US foreign policy on its head. His openness towards Vladimir Putin has dismayed most of the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But it's now shared by some European politicians, not all of them far-right extremists, in France, Italy, Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere. They can't all be Kremlin agents - so what's the new pull of Putin for some in the West? The two politicians, one American, one Russian, put down their drinks and clasped hands across the pub table. Then they both pushed. But there was no real contest. The arm-wrestling match was over in a second and the winner was the deputy mayor of St Petersburg, a man who'd built up his strength through years of judo training.  Few outside Russia had ever heard of him. But five years later he would become its president. US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher still laughs when he recalls his brief duel with Vladimir Putin in 1995, when the Russian came over in an official delegation. He hasn't met Mr Putin since. But for many years he's been the most consistent voice for dÃ©tente on Capitol Hill, often effectively in a minority of one. ""I don't see Putin as a good guy, I see him as a bad guy. But every bad guy in the world isn't our enemy that we have to find ways of thwarting and beating up,"" Congressman Rohrabacher says. ""There are a lot of areas where this would be a better world if we were working together, rather than this constant barrage of hostility aimed at anything the Russians are trying to do."" Mr Rohrabacher doesn't condone Russian hacking during the US election campaign or the Kremlin's military incursions into Ukraine. But he believes Russia is the victim of Western double standards. US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher believes the West should co-operate more with Russia And that view is shared by some Western experts on Russia, though the vast majority stress how aggressive the country has become under President Putin. Richard Sakwa, Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent, in the UK, is in the minority camp. ""We are living in a huge echo chamber which only listens to itself,"" he says. ""The key meme is 'Russian aggression' and it's repeated ad nauseam instead of thinking. ""When we have national interests, that's good. But when Russia tries to defend its interests, it's illegitimate, it's aggressive, and it's dangerous for the rest of the world."" Could Trump defrost Russian relations? Who are the figures pushing Trump and Putin together? Putin: Russia 'stronger than any aggressor' Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea and military support of separatists in eastern Ukraine is widely taken as evidence that Mr Putin seeks to extend his country's borders. But Prof Sakwa sees the Ukrainian crisis as a symptom of the failure after the Cold War to establish a new international security system that would have included Russia. Meanwhile Stephen Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Russian Studies at New York University, argues that the ""vilification"" of President Putin in the West stems originally from disappointment that the Russian leader turned his back on some of the Western-inspired reforms of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin: reforms that many Russians blame for the lawlessness and falling living standards of that period. ""Putin is a European man trying to rule a country that is only partially European,"" Cohen says. ""But we demand that the whole world be on our historical clock."" Did President Putin turn his back on Boris Yeltsin's reforms? Prof Cohen is a rare liberal voice for detente. Most Americans who want better relations with Russia are on the political right. Some are neo-isolationists who dislike what they see as their country's attempts to ""export democracy"", whether to Iraq, Syria or Russia. In that, they're at one with the Kremlin, which opposes any outside interference in the affairs of sovereign states. Others are ""strategic realists"" who argue that great powers, including Russia, will always have ""spheres of influence"" beyond their borders. America's Monroe Doctrine sought to prevent outside military and political involvement in the New World. The opposite argument is that independent states have the right to belong to whatever alliances they like. Most former Soviet-bloc countries in Eastern Europe joined NATO and the EU after the Cold War. And some present and former leaders of those states have warned Trump that any attempt to strike a grand bargain with Mr Putin would endanger the region's security. But one central European government - Hungary's - takes a different view. ""We don't see Russia as a threat to Hungary,"" its foreign minister Peter Szijjarto says. ""If Russia and the US cannot work together on global issues, then that undermines security in Eastern Europe."" Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto says his country doesn't regard Russia as a threat Hungary also wants to end the Western sanctions imposed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea. It says they've been counter-productive, leading to Russian counter-sanctions which have damaged European export industries. Peter Toth, head of the Hungarian association of breeders of mangalica pigs - whose fat is much prized in Russia - says his members are among those now suffering. But the Hungarian government, which has been widely criticised for curtailing some democratic checks and balance, also shares other interests with Russia. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said Europe must keep its ""Christian values"" in the face of immigration from Muslim countries. The Kremlin has also made much of the need to preserve national identity and Christian values in its rhetoric, leading nationalists in the West to see Moscow as an ally. Many, particularly on the right, believe the threat from mass immigration, and terrorism, is now greater than that from Russia. Congressman Rohrabacher says: ""To say Russia is the enemy, when they too are threatened by radical Islamic terrorism, is exactly the wrong way to go."" Arguments like that, reinforced by President Trump, seem to be swaying some Americans. By the end of last year, more than a third of Republican voters viewed President Putin favourably, according to a YouGov poll, compared to only a tenth in 2014. It found however that Democrats dislike Mr Putin more than ever. Prof Stephen Cohen believes Donald Trump will have great difficulty selling a new policy on Russia. ""If Trump says we need a detente with Putin for the sake of our national security,"" he explains, ""it's going to be very hard to get people in the centre and the left to support it, because they'll be called apologists for Putin and Trump. It's a double whammy."" Tim Whewell's BBC Radio 4 programme, The Pull of Putin, isavailable to listen to via BBC iPlayer.

"Nato members will want to be reassured by General Mattis This meeting of Nato defence ministers is the first formal alliance get-together since the arrival of the Trump administration in Washington. Mr Trump's initial suggestion that Nato was in some sense ""obsolete"", along with his stated desire to do deals with Moscow, set alarm bells ringing in many capitals, where Russia is seen as a re-emerging strategic threat. Many in Europe see elements in the Trump administration as having an in-built antipathy towards multilateral  institutions. There were also fears about certain officials' closeness to Moscow - a worry that the US might seek a strategic dialogue with Russia over Europeans' heads. Accordingly, the resignation of the president's controversial National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will not prompt many tears in Europe. America's European allies will, though, at least to some extent, have been reassured by the subsequent noises that have come out of Washington. But they will want to hear direct reassurance from Gen James Mattis - Mr Trump's new defence secretary - that the alliance retains its centrality in US security thinking. They will also want confirmed that all of the steps that the Obama administration took to reinforce deterrence in Europe - the deployment of additional combat brigades and an intensive series of exercises -  will continue under the new man in the White House. Poland is one of just five Nato members to meet spending the spending benchmark in 2016 Of course Gen Mattis will come with some messages of his own. President Trump - indeed the US Congress - wants to see the European allies shoulder more of the cost of their own defence. Washington has shown that it is willing to stump up troops and equipment, but while collective Nato expenditure is rising, too many Nato governments have been sluggish in bringing their expenditure up to the agreed target of 2% of GDP. According to the latest Nato figures only five allies, Estonia, Greece, Poland, the UK and the United States met or exceeded the 2% benchmark in 2016. The demand from Washington that its allies spend more on their collective defence has been a consistent one over recent years. As a former Nato commander, Gen Mattis knows the alliance well and he has heard all of the excuses before. He will deliver the familiar message with more punch and with a clear implication that this time the US administration expects to see prompt action. Gen Mattis also wants to see Nato become more agile and better at decision-making especially at times of crisis. Washington wants to see the alliance playing a greater role in international efforts to defeat terror and to help prop up failing states. Reality Check: Is the UK spending 2% of GDP on defence? Profile: Nato Where Trump stands on key issues This is a difficult area which causes divisions among the alliance's European members as much as between European capitals and Washington. Iraq - where Nato has already agreed to conduct a small amount of training - could become a test case. The Americans are already thinking about what will happen after Mosul is fully re-captured. As the situation on the ground transitions from all-out war-fighting, there will be a continuing need to build Iraqi capabilities. Here there are lots of things that the US believes Nato countries could do - training for border patrolling, instituting defence reforms and so on. So far the response among allies to the small-scale effort in Iraq has been, shall we say, limited. As far as Washington is concerned, Nato countries don't just need to spend more - they need to significantly enhance their capabilities and be relevant to the sort of real-world tasks in which the US wants its partners to be engaged. Nato's response to a more assertive Russia is all very well but it threatens to open up fissures between northern and eastern allies, on the one hand, who directly face Russia's modernising forces and countries on Nato's Mediterranean flank, on the other, who confront a very different set of challenges. The alliance is faced with a more militarily assertive Russia As the paroxysms in Syria and Libya have shown, the migrant or refugee crisis has repercussions throughout the Middle East and much of Europe. At this meeting, Nato ministers want to apply a small corrective to enhance the focus on threats from the south. It's a modest start - a small command hub at the joint forces headquarters in Naples whose job will be to explore what Nato can contribute to dealing with the complex security challenges on its southern flank. But as well as a demand for a more dynamic Nato agenda the US is eager to reassure its allies. A senior US Congressional delegation is visiting the Nato headquarters this week. The Nato meeting is followed by Europe's premier annual security event - the Munich conference - after which the US vice-president himself will also be stopping by at Nato. It is all something of a curtain-raiser for the US president's own first visit to the alliance which will take place in late May. That looks set to be a fairly brief event - little more than a lunch - in Nato's brand new headquarters building, which inconveniently will not be finished in time for the summit. By then it is hoped that Mr Trump will have fully made his peace with Nato. If not, a reduced scale summit in an unfinished building holds risks as well as opportunities. The headline writers could have a field day. The hope is that this Nato ministerial meeting will set the course for more harmonious relations between the alliance and its most important, albeit mercurial member.

"Daniel found it hard to adjust after leaving care Young people who have grown up in care are far more likely to die in early adulthood than other young people, Freedom of Information figures reveal. They show 90 people who left care in England between 2012 and 2016 died in the years when they would have turned 19, 20 or 21. Care leavers make up 1% of the population at these ages, but make up around 7% of the deaths. The government says it is investing Â£10m in support for those leaving care. While an exact comparison is difficult, the official figures, showing people who left care between 2012 and 2016, indicate they are roughly seven times more likely to die when they are aged from 18 to 21 than other young people of a similar age. An inability to access physical and mental healthcare has been cited by care leavers as key contributory factors. One young man described being ""palmed off with pills"" when he tried to get mental health support. Colin became reliant on drugs after leaving care Colin Raggett, 27, explained how, after leaving care, he became reliant on drugs. ""After care I was all alone, I was in a lot of debt, and I was constantly going out trying to make money, committing crimes to fund my drug habit."" He made several suicide attempts and during his last attempt, it was a chance intervention that saved his life. ""It came to the stage when I was stood on a train track one day. And I was spotted by my mental health worker, who completely by chance was also at the station, waiting to get on another train."" His mental health worker raised the alarm to save him. ""The police were there, the fire brigade, ambulances, they closed the line off... It was the road to nowhere. And they were like 'He's got to go in for some psychiatric care.'"" When Colin had reached out for help in the past, he felt it was not forthcoming. ""They were putting me on one drug to try and get me off the drugs I was already on. They tried to put me on Ritalin, and I then got addicted to that. ""I felt they were just trying to palm me off. They just said you will be fine. Just take this pill, just take that pill."" It was the lack of a holistic approach to care leavers that posed the biggest problem for Colin. He resolved this by making contact with The Prince's Trust, a charity that works with vulnerable young people. These figures from the Department for Education could be an underestimate - as investigations into untimely deaths might not identify that someone was formerly in social care. ""Coroners will not be provided with the care status of a young person whose untimely death they are investigating,"" says Alice Frank, manager of the National Leaving Care Benchmarking Forum at social enterprise Catch 22. ""Those care leavers who die while out of contact with their councils will not be reported to those councils, and the young person's care status will not be recorded in their death certificate."" Around 500 care leavers are recorded as refusing contact with their local authorities, according to Department for Education statistics. One care worker, speaking anonymously, explained what this meant in practice. ""We had dealt with the case of one young man, who despite having a history of depression, seemed to be on track at the age of 21. ""As was correct, his case was closed, and we ceased contact with him. However, unfortunately, his life went downhill after that. ""He turned to drink and drugs, and did not receive proper mental health care. He committed suicide at the age of 23. ""We found out that he had died, by complete chance. We recognised his picture in the local paper when it ran a story announcing his death. It was quite a shock."" Keeping a routine after years of disruption can be difficult for care leavers. An inability to manage their own affairs often leaves these young people vulnerable. Another young man who had a fortunate escape was Daniel Lee-Grabowski. Daniel, now 24 and a student at the University of the Arts London, found it difficult to stay healthy and organised after leaving the care of Surrey Council. ""Reality hits you quite harshly when you turn 18. You are not really prepared to move out into the real world in the right way. ""When I moved out into my own flat, I was left with bills and I didn't know basic things like that you had to pay to watch television. I couldn't even use a washing machine. ""These are things you just don't get told. If you have a family they would be able to show you what compartment to put the powder in. But I didn't have any of that."" Daniel was kept on on track by an apprenticeship with Surrey Council, which he says gave him a purpose, an income and the support of his colleagues. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We are committed to improving the lives of care leavers and giving them the support they need as they make their way into adulthood. ""That's why we are investing nearly Â£10m over the next four years in improving mental health support for looked-after young people in secure children's homes, and are changing the law so local authorities have to promote the physical and mental health of children in care."" Councillor Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: ""It is disappointing that this report treats care leavers as a homogenous group, taking no account of factors such as their individual life experiences, their age at coming into care or the amount of support that councils were able to provide. ""Research shows that the stability provided by carers can help children to achieve consistently better results at school when compared to children living with their families while receiving social work support, particularly when that care started early.""

"Donald Trump's willingness to build better relations with Russia is threatening to turn US foreign policy on its head. His openness towards Vladimir Putin has dismayed most of the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But it's now shared by some European politicians, not all of them far-right extremists, in France, Italy, Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere. They can't all be Kremlin agents - so what's the new pull of Putin for some in the West? The two politicians, one American, one Russian, put down their drinks and clasped hands across the pub table. Then they both pushed. But there was no real contest. The arm-wrestling match was over in a second and the winner was the deputy mayor of St Petersburg, a man who'd built up his strength through years of judo training.  Few outside Russia had ever heard of him. But five years later he would become its president. US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher still laughs when he recalls his brief duel with Vladimir Putin in 1995, when the Russian came over in an official delegation. He hasn't met Mr Putin since. But for many years he's been the most consistent voice for dÃ©tente on Capitol Hill, often effectively in a minority of one. ""I don't see Putin as a good guy, I see him as a bad guy. But every bad guy in the world isn't our enemy that we have to find ways of thwarting and beating up,"" Congressman Rohrabacher says. ""There are a lot of areas where this would be a better world if we were working together, rather than this constant barrage of hostility aimed at anything the Russians are trying to do."" Mr Rohrabacher doesn't condone Russian hacking during the US election campaign or the Kremlin's military incursions into Ukraine. But he believes Russia is the victim of Western double standards. US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher believes the West should co-operate more with Russia And that view is shared by some Western experts on Russia, though the vast majority stress how aggressive the country has become under President Putin. Richard Sakwa, Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent, in the UK, is in the minority camp. ""We are living in a huge echo chamber which only listens to itself,"" he says. ""The key meme is 'Russian aggression' and it's repeated ad nauseam instead of thinking. ""When we have national interests, that's good. But when Russia tries to defend its interests, it's illegitimate, it's aggressive, and it's dangerous for the rest of the world."" Could Trump defrost Russian relations? Who are the figures pushing Trump and Putin together? Putin: Russia 'stronger than any aggressor' Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea and military support of separatists in eastern Ukraine is widely taken as evidence that Mr Putin seeks to extend his country's borders. But Prof Sakwa sees the Ukrainian crisis as a symptom of the failure after the Cold War to establish a new international security system that would have included Russia. Meanwhile Stephen Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Russian Studies at New York University, argues that the ""vilification"" of President Putin in the West stems originally from disappointment that the Russian leader turned his back on some of the Western-inspired reforms of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin: reforms that many Russians blame for the lawlessness and falling living standards of that period.

"European Parliament: Brexit is fuelling pressure to reform EU institutions There is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems. It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill. It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity. British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy. It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate. But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK. In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who willrepresent that body in Brexit negotiations. Guy Verhofstadt rejects claims that European voters have turned against the EU In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results."" Mr Verhofstadt has along list of suggested fixes,externalfor this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: theEuropean Banking Authority,externaland theEuropean Medicines Agency,external. UKIP's Nigel Farage - an anti-EU MEP in the vanguard of Brexit But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch. The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular."" There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries. Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroads Brexit: All you need to know But for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years. That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste. There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later.

"The days of the three-hour, five-bottle City lunch appear to be well and truly over after Lloyd's of London introduced a booze ban. The insurance market has told its 800 employees that they are not allowed to drink alcohol between 09:00 and 17:00. Lloyd's said it had been considering the move for some time to bring it into line with ""industry norms"". The ban applies to Lloyd's staff, not brokers and underwriters doing business in the historic insurance market. But angry staff have called the new measures ""heavy-handed"". Workers took to Lloyd's intranet to air their grievances, with one asking: ""Will we be asked to go to bed earlier soon?"" According to the London Evening Standard, another asked: ""Did I just wake up from my drunken induced slumber to find we are now living in Orwell's 1984?"" This video can not be played Last orders for ""boozy lunches"" in The City? The boozy lunch had long been a staple of City life when deals were done and contacts made. A spokesman for Lloyd's said: ""There is no denying that it has traditionally been part and parcel of this type of business."" In an internal memo to staff, Lloyd's said an examination of grievance and disciplinary cases over the last two years found that about half were related to alcohol. A Lloyd's spokesman said that the market had changed and that Lloyd's wanted to attract younger people to the industry. He added that Lloyd's wanted to bring its employee guide into line with other companies, such as QBE, which advises staff not to drink as opposed to an outright ban. He said that if someone was found to have broken the rule, their manager will decide on the best course of action to take.

"Guns N' Roses (pictured in Brisbane) swiftly apologised on social media No-one likes being mistaken for someone else - especially if that someone else has been their sworn rival for more than a century. So when Guns N' Roses' announcer yelled ""Sydney"" just before they walked on stage in Melbourne, the band were met with a chorus of boos. And to make matters worse, the veteran rockers weren't even on time. Luckily, it seems they made up for it with a rousing concert - and a swiftly issued apology on social media. ""Melbourne!"" the band - which had just completed two nights in Sydney - posted on Twitter. ""Accidentally after 30 years McBob made an error, we're truly sorry. Thank you for coming out tonight!"" Luckily, guitar technician McBob, who has been introducing the group on stages around the world during their Not In This Lifetime tour, was quickly forgiven by fans for his momentary slip up. One follower replied to the post with: ""One mistake every 30 years... Reasonable."" Turns out, Guns N' Roses aren't the only ones to get a little confused on their exact location. Britney Spearsdid not win any extra applause for confusing Manchester with London in 2009 Bruce Springsteenyelled out ""Party noises, Pittsburgh"" in March 2016, only to realise he was actually in Cleveland Ushermanaged to mix up Manchester with Maidstone, in Kent, at Radio One's Big Weekend back in 2008 Robbie Williamswent one better, and confused which country he was in back in 2015 - yelling out ""Zagreb"", Croatia, instead of Belgrade, Serbia Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities, have had a long-running rivalry dating back to gripes over trade during colonial times.

"Much of Facebookâs recent growth can be attributed to the spread of video on its network - and the company told investors recently it planned to aggressively monetise that success. Today,it announced,externalsome ideas to get things moving - starting with a change many users may not appreciate. Videos have autoplayed on Facebookâs News Feed for some time, leading to a curious rise of âsilent moviesâ as publishers adapted to knowing that the majority of viewers would be watching, but not listening, to their work. But between now and the end of the year Facebookâs News Feed will be enabling sound on your News Feed by default, a move the company has been testing out on a limited number of users for a short while. The firm said it had received âpositive feedbackâ so far. ""With this update, sound fades in and out as you scroll through videos in News Feed, bringing those videos to life,â the company explained in a blog post on Tuesday. ""As people watch more video on phones, theyâve come to expect sound when the volume on their device is turned on.â Thankfully - for those who donât want videos to suddenly play out on the bus - if your phone is set to be completely silent, Facebook will not override that. You can also turn it off completely in the Facebook appâs settings. But data shows us that when something is thrust upon users as the default, they will mostly stick to it. Facebook plans to aggressively monetise its video success It will likely change the style of many of the videos we see on the network. For some time now, publishers have realised that because viewers were probably not listening to clips, but just watching them, they needed to add subtitles as a way to draw people in. Publishers may well relish the chance to do away with that legwork. Subtitling is time-consuming and costly. Facebookâs analytics tools go into great detail about how videos are performing, and so expect companies to be watching closely to see if they can now give up on subtitles. Accessibility hit If thatâs the case, it could potentially be terrible news for accessibility. One welcome side effect of viewing habits on Facebook has been that impaired viewers were benefitting from subtitling becoming good business sense as well as just the right thing to do for accessibility. Earlier this week in the UK,disability groups cheered the arrival of a new amendment,externalto the Digital Economy Bill that would push broadcasters to improve subtitling for on-demand content. It is intended to bring existing laws over TV subtitling into the modern age - giving media regulator Ofcom the ability to set quotas and minimum standards for subtitling online. But that, as it stands, would not apply to Facebook - and even if it did, the majority of video posted to Facebook originates overseas. There is, however, potential good news on the horizon:Facebook has also been tentatively rolling out voice recognition software,externaldesigned to automatically transcribe clips and add subtitles. But, Iâm yet to see software truly up to that massive task. Todayâs announcement by Facebook was just one part of several plans the company shared about its video ambitions. Vertical videos will be displayed in full, and therefore appear larger in your feed. And youâll also be able to carry on watching a video while scrolling down your feed - a feature already found in YouTubeâs app. The plans also include new efforts to reach viewers through their televisions. The company is launching an app on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV with more platforms to come, it said.

"Daniel found it hard to adjust after leaving care Young people who have grown up in care are far more likely to die in early adulthood than other young people, Freedom of Information figures reveal. They show 90 people who left care in England between 2012 and 2016 died in the years when they would have turned 19, 20 or 21. Care leavers make up 1% of the population at these ages, but make up around 7% of the deaths. The government says it is investing Â£10m in support for those leaving care. While an exact comparison is difficult, the official figures, showing people who left care between 2012 and 2016, indicate they are roughly seven times more likely to die when they are aged from 18 to 21 than other young people of a similar age. An inability to access physical and mental healthcare has been cited by care leavers as key contributory factors. One young man described being ""palmed off with pills"" when he tried to get mental health support. Colin became reliant on drugs after leaving care Colin Raggett, 27, explained how, after leaving care, he became reliant on drugs. ""After care I was all alone, I was in a lot of debt, and I was constantly going out trying to make money, committing crimes to fund my drug habit."" He made several suicide attempts and during his last attempt, it was a chance intervention that saved his life. ""It came to the stage when I was stood on a train track one day. And I was spotted by my mental health worker, who completely by chance was also at the station, waiting to get on another train."" His mental health worker raised the alarm to save him. ""The police were there, the fire brigade, ambulances, they closed the line off... It was the road to nowhere. And they were like 'He's got to go in for some psychiatric care.'"" When Colin had reached out for help in the past, he felt it was not forthcoming. ""They were putting me on one drug to try and get me off the drugs I was already on. They tried to put me on Ritalin, and I then got addicted to that. ""I felt they were just trying to palm me off. They just said you will be fine. Just take this pill, just take that pill."" It was the lack of a holistic approach to care leavers that posed the biggest problem for Colin. He resolved this by making contact with The Prince's Trust, a charity that works with vulnerable young people. These figures from the Department for Education could be an underestimate - as investigations into untimely deaths might not identify that someone was formerly in social care. ""Coroners will not be provided with the care status of a young person whose untimely death they are investigating,"" says Alice Frank, manager of the National Leaving Care Benchmarking Forum at social enterprise Catch 22. ""Those care leavers who die while out of contact with their councils will not be reported to those councils, and the young person's care status will not be recorded in their death certificate."" Around 500 care leavers are recorded as refusing contact with their local authorities, according to Department for Education statistics. One care worker, speaking anonymously, explained what this meant in practice. ""We had dealt with the case of one young man, who despite having a history of depression, seemed to be on track at the age of 21. ""As was correct, his case was closed, and we ceased contact with him. However, unfortunately, his life went downhill after that. ""He turned to drink and drugs, and did not receive proper mental health care. He committed suicide at the age of 23. ""We found out that he had died, by complete chance. We recognised his picture in the local paper when it ran a story announcing his death. It was quite a shock."" Keeping a routine after years of disruption can be difficult for care leavers. An inability to manage their own affairs often leaves these young people vulnerable. Another young man who had a fortunate escape was Daniel Lee-Grabowski. Daniel, now 24 and a student at the University of the Arts London, found it difficult to stay healthy and organised after leaving the care of Surrey Council. ""Reality hits you quite harshly when you turn 18. You are not really prepared to move out into the real world in the right way. ""When I moved out into my own flat, I was left with bills and I didn't know basic things like that you had to pay to watch television. I couldn't even use a washing machine. ""These are things you just don't get told. If you have a family they would be able to show you what compartment to put the powder in. But I didn't have any of that."" Daniel was kept on on track by an apprenticeship with Surrey Council, which he says gave him a purpose, an income and the support of his colleagues. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We are committed to improving the lives of care leavers and giving them the support they need as they make their way into adulthood. ""That's why we are investing nearly Â£10m over the next four years in improving mental health support for looked-after young people in secure children's homes, and are changing the law so local authorities have to promote the physical and mental health of children in care."" Councillor Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: ""It is disappointing that this report treats care leavers as a homogenous group, taking no account of factors such as their individual life experiences, their age at coming into care or the amount of support that councils were able to provide. ""Research shows that the stability provided by carers can help children to achieve consistently better results at school when compared to children living with their families while receiving social work support, particularly when that care started early.""

"The Archbishop of Canterbury was certainly the highlight of the opening day at general synod. Less an address, more a sermon,external, he appealed to Christians to turn away from self-indulgence and toward self-sacrifice in order to contribute positively at a time of uncertainty and fearâ¦ a climate that he said had been brought about by populist movements across Europe and the election of Donald Trump. ""It is a moment of challenge, but challenge that as a nation can be overcome with the right practices, values, culture and spirit,"" explained the archbishop. ""Which is where we come in. Let's not be too self-important. I don't mean we, the Church of England, are the answer. ""But we can be part of the answer, we have a voice and a contribution and a capacity and a reach and above all a Lord who is faithful when we fail and faithful when we flourish."" But while these comments were made in the context of post-Brexit uncertainty, it was obvious to everyone gathered in the assembly hall of Church House in Westminster that the archbishop was also thinking of Wednesday, whensynod,externalwill debate the bishops' report on same-sex marriage. This video can not be played The Archbishop of Canterbury addresses General Synod GS2055, as it is known, was published last month,externaland provoked an immediate outcry. Members of the LGBTI community expressed anger that, after engaging in three years of so-called ""shared conversations"", the bishops decided not to recommend any change to church practice. Marriage in church would remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman; there would be no facility to bless same-sex marriages. Wednesday has therefore become the focal point for both traditionalists and those who want the church to mirror a change in the law of the land, which has allowed same-sex marriage since March 2014. As members arrive on Wednesday morning, they'll be greeted by a vigil organised by theLesbian and Gay Christian Movement,externalandChanging Attitude,externalwith the support of thePeter Tatchell Foundation,externalandOut and Proud African LGBTI,external. Mr Tatchell, anticipating the protest, said: ""The bishops' report defends heterosexual superiority and opposes same-sex blessings and marriages. The church blesses dogs and cats but it refuses to bless loving, committed same-sex couples. It treats LGBTI clergy and laity as second class, both within the church and the wider society."" The bishops' report says marriage in church will remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman The debate inside, which begins at 17:30 GMT and is scheduled to last for 90 minutes, will be no less accusatory. It is likely to expose the fractures and fissures that exist within the heart of Christian unity. Evangelical christians, like Ed Shaw, a member of synod and a trustee ofLiving Out,external, a charity that exists to support same-sex-attracted Christians who have chosen to remain celibate, are relieved that the bishops have upheld what they say is the biblical position on marriage. ""I think the Church of England has carefully listened,"" he said. ""I think the Church has also come to the settled view of what Christians have always believed down the centuries and what most Christians believe around the world."" For the moment, this remains the official position of the Church of England. As the Archbishop of Canterbury drew his opening address to a close, he did make one explicit reference to same-sex marriage.  He described ""the painful discussions"" that will take place on Wednesday. That phrase may yet prove to be the understatement of the year.

"Sherlock has been sold internationally to 240 territories Sherlock has come out on top again - this time in a worldwide poll of most popular BBC television characters. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch said he was ""honoured"" to see his portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuth voted top by viewers in seven countries. He continued: ""Who would have thought a high-functioning sociopath could be so popular... all over the world?"" Another poll of iconic BBC moments saw Sherlock seemingly falling to his death score more than a quarter of the vote. That put the ending of 2012's Reichenbach Fall episode streets ahead of Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch, its closest competitor. The BBC Worldwide Showcase poll surveyed more than 7,000 people from Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. Almost 30% of respondents put Sherlock Holmes top, ahead of the Doctor of Doctor Who fame, Idris Elba's Luther, Fawlty Towers' Basil and Top Gear's Stig. Patsy Stone, played by Joanna Lumley, is the most fabulous woman on the BBC's popularity list Ab Fab's Patsy Stone is the highest ranking woman in the list - though that may changeif the next Doctor is female, or if it turns out The Stig has been keeping something from us. Other characters on the Top 10 include Edmund Blackadder, Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances and the Vicar of Dibley. Basil Fawlty makes another appearance in the Top 10 of most iconic BBC moments, thanks to the Gourmet Night episode in which he attacks his car. Other moments singled out include Colin Firth's Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in Pride and Prejudice and David Brent's ""dancing"" in The Office.

"One heartbroken person sent a collection of font examples they ""mutually loved"" with their partner After a relationship ends, even the most mundane objects can become painful reminders. One museum in Los Angeles puts them on display. When you're heartbroken, everything reminds you of the person who's no longer there. So do you burn your love letters? Throw away your wedding dress after a divorce? Send back that single mismatched sock? At the Museum of Broken Relationships in Hollywood, everyday stuff is exhibited as art along with each object's story of betrayal or loss. The result is a moving collection of heartbreak. One woman from San Francisco crammed her wedding dress into a pickle jar after her husband of five years left her. Even though her dress was ""non-traditional"" -  meaning the kind you could wear again - she never did. ""I hate throwing perfectly functional items in landfills but would hate to see someone walking around in my once beautiful but now sadness-infused dress,"" the woman wrote on a card now on display next to the jar. The jar was used mainly for space, she wrote, but ""any sort of appropriate pickle metaphors can also be invoked"". All of the items at the museum are exhibited anonymously. The museum, which opened this summer, was created by a lawyer who visited the original Museum of Broken Relationships in Croatia and wanted to bring the concept to Los Angeles. Two artists opened the Croatian museum after breaking up and deciding to curate the debris from their relationship. The exhibits in the LA museum are donated from around the world. A Norwegian donated an iron with the short story:  ""This iron was used to iron my wedding suit. Now it is the only thing left."" One exhibit displays an expensive bottle of wine a British couple having an affair planned to drink once they both left their spouses. But the wine remains untouched, the bottle never opened. What happened to their marriages, or if their spouses knew about their infidelity, is left unsaid. A Slovenian donated a key - a small gift from a friend. The story behind the key says: ""You turned my head; you just did not want to sleep with me. I realized how much you loved me only after you died of Aids."" The museum attracts both the broken-hearted having a cathartic cry and couples on dates, says Alexis Hyde, the director of the museum. But she was surprised that it's become a family destination for parents looking for ways to talk about love with their teenage children. ""It becomes this really safe place to talk about sex and relationships in a way that's not like 'Gross, mom stop talking to me,'"" Ms Hyde says. ""It's a really beautiful way to open a dialogue about what is OK and what is not,"" she says. ""You're going to have your heart broken and that's normal. Even though you feel so alone, you're actually very normal."" ""It's a little less isolating I think."" One of the more unusual exhibits is a pair of sizeable silicone breast implants a woman says she felt pressured to get by an ex-boyfriend. Her body rejected the implants and she had to have multiple surgeries to remove them and reconstruct her body. ""She held on to them to remind herself don't change for someone else. You have to love yourself to be loved and be in a productive relationship,"" Ms Hyde says, adding that the woman hoped her donation would inspire others to have healthier relationships. ""She was hoping that people would read this and take the cautionary tale."" The museum also includes a broken promise ring and a collection of tins, boxes and books with examples of the ""mutually loved font"" of a former couple. There's a dress bought by a girl who planned to wear it to impress a boy. But the boy killed himself before she had the chance. Mix tapes - a sign of love - now in the museum There's also a drawer full of mix tapes on display. If you don't remember mix tapes, they were the ultimate romantic gesture of the 1980s - painstakingly-made collections of music put together by recording songs off the radio on to cassette tapes. If you missed the start of the song you planned to record, you had to wait for the DJ to play it again the next hour or day, depending on the song's popularity. The collection is not what people have come to expect from a museum on Hollywood Boulevard, where tourists frequent Madame Tussauds wax museum and where actors dressed as Chewbacca and Spider-Man hustle tourists for photos. ""This museum cuts through to the truth of the human experience now like a scalpel. I think that it's a very sophisticated, conceptual art museum even though maybe the objects that compose it themselves individually might not be necessarily considered art,"" says Ms Hyde. Alexis Hyde says the museum ""cuts through to the truth of the human experience"" Visitors here are more from the local Los Angeles art scene than tourists. Inside, it's a quiet, cathartic museum and many visitors walk the museum alone, quietly crying. Many visitors say they come to feel less alone and more connected to their fellow lonely hearts. But one visitor says the experience is overwhelming. ""I'm feeling their pain,"" he says of the people who donated items to the museum. ""I just feel so alone in here.""

"This video can not be played Inside a guinea pig farm Most people see them as fluffy adorable pets, but in Peru guinea pigs - or ""cuy"" as they are known locally - are a delicacy. In the past few years their popularity has really taken off and a boom in guinea pig farming is helping many peasant farmers living below the minimum wage to get out of poverty. You can hear them as soon as you walk into the dusty barn. The open cages are filled with hundreds of squeaking brown and white guinea pigs, waiting for their owner, Maria Camero, to fill up their red water buckets and give them corn. ""In the past it was only people living in the mountains who bred guinea pigs but now we've realised it's a good business,"" says Maria. Guinea pig breeding is ""a good business"", says Maria Camero ""You can start with something like $100 (Â£80) and that money quickly grows because by three months the guinea pigs can start breeding and they will have up to five babies, so the business grows fast."" Maria and her family produce guinea pigs on a much larger scale now thanks to her son-in-law Alessio Cresci. The Italian fell in love with Shelia, Maria's daughter, and decided to move to Peru and build up their business. Maria went from looking after a few guinea pigs to being part of a team breeding hundreds. Previously only farmers in the Andes ate guinea pigs, but they are now popular throughout Peru and Bolivia As well as supplying to local restaurants, they also sell and sometimes donate start-up kits to local farmers who want to get involved, consisting of a breeding pair of guinea pigs and the food and pens that they need. ""I have a daughter who is 13 and I can afford to pay for her to go to a better school, I have also paid for my son to go to university and study to be a graphic designer. This business lets me do that,"" says Maria. Maria's daughter and son-in-law, Shelia and Alessio, have helped build up the business Thirty dollars a month is the average wage for a peasant farmer. Many of them are now earning $130 a month, according to Lionel Vigil, the regional director of World Neighbours, a charity that helps them get started. The key to their success is the restaurant business, which can't get enough of cuy. Farmers can sell them to local restaurants for about $8 and to high-end restaurants in Lima for up to $13. ""The Incas have eaten cuy for centuries, but in the past it was only farmers in the Andes still eating them,"" says Mr Vigil. ""When they migrated to Lima they carried on, and little by little other Peruvians from different backgrounds started to get a taste for it and restaurants started to buy guinea pigs."" Farmers can quadruple their monthly incomes by breeding guinea pigs, says Lionel Vigil of the charity World Neighbours Producers are even looking to the US as a market. Ex-pat Bolivians and Peruvians are prepared to pay $30 for a guinea pig that they eat on special occasions, chopped up and deep fried a bit like chicken. At first it was hard to get permission for officials to let frozen guinea pigs into the US where, like most of the world, they are regarded as pets. But with the support of academics and anthropologists, one exporter, Mega Business, has persuaded authorities that this is part of Andean culture and guinea pigs also have a very important nutritional value. In fact, Peruvians have never seen cuy as pets. And although they accept they are small and sweet, their culinary value trumps their cuteness. Traditional baked guinea pig - though not all visitors to Peru are keen to eat it this way Jaime Pesaque is the owner of Mayta, a high-end restaurant in upmarket Lima. He buys about 200 organically fed guinea pigs a month. He says they are high in protein and low in fat. Traditionally guinea pigs were served teeth, claws and all as a kind of kebab on the local streets - a method that put many people off. Jaime has found a more user-friendly recipe. ""We take out all the bones and cook it the whole night, then we press it for a couple of hours and cook it."" Not your regular cooked guinea pig I was dreading trying this national delicacy. I remember those fangs and claws thrust up at me through a train on my way to Machu Picchu. I vowed never to try it. But things changeâ¦ And Jaime's version is delicious. The meat is sweet and juicy, a bit like rabbit and pork, and the skin is crispy. He has a new convert. Many of the people eating in high-end restaurants are tourists who are eager to try something different - provided it is served in the right way. Although they will always be seen first and foremost as pets for the majority of people in the world, in Peru guinea pigs are offering a way out of poverty.

"It's generally agreed that eating too much fat is bad for you, but exactly how much damage it can do depends on whether you are a man or a woman, writes Dr Zoe Williams. Eating too much fat can make you put on weight and lead to heart disease - especially if you eat too much of the wrong kind of fat, such as the omega-6 fats found in many processed foods. But now it seems sausages, pastries and cakes are even worse for men than they are for women. A recent study measured how the two sexes responded when they spent a week eating large amounts of these foods and how it affected their ability to control blood sugar levels. I wanted to test this diet myself, and in order to compare my response to that of a man I persuaded the person behind the research, Dr Matt Cocks of Liverpool John Moores University, to join me. Before we started, our body fat was measured and our blood sugar levels recorded. We were given glucose monitors to wear to keep track of our blood sugar throughout the week. The food which Zoe had to eat during the week Breakfast: Three eggs, 30g cheddar cheese, 60g chorizo, 10g butter Lunch: 10g butter, cheese and onion roll, pork pie, two cheese strings Dinner: 150g pork belly, 30g cheddar cheese, 60g coleslaw, three hash browns Snacks: Can of cola, 30g nuts In order to have an impact in just one week, our diet contained about 50% more calories than we would normally eat. A typical evening meal included a couple of sausages, some hash browns, a few slices of bacon, and a lump of cheese. Twice during the week, Matt and I also drank a sugary drink to introduce sugar into our blood stream. This mimics what happens when we eat carbohydrates which our bodies break down into sugars. The glucose monitors would be able to show us whether the diet was affecting our ability to clear this sugar from our blood. When we looked at the results we saw that, like the women in Matt's study, my ability to control my blood sugar levels didn't get any worse on the diet. Matt, however, got 50% worse at clearing glucose from his blood. The same trend was apparent in Matt's research, where on average men got 14% worse at controlling their sugar levels. ""One of the first steps towards type 2 diabetes is poorer control of glucose,"" says Matt. ""So what we're seeing here, is that I've really lowered my control of sugar, and if I continued with that for a long time, that would probably progress me to type 2 diabetes."" Trust Me, I'm A Doctoris on BBC Two at 20:00 GMT, Wednesday 15 February -catch up on BBC iPlayer Do you have an underactive thyroid? Which foods can improve your gut bacteria? The man with a titanium chest The diet Matt and I undertook was extreme but in the real world the same processes will be happening to a lesser extent in people who regularly over consume unhealthy fats. So what can men do about it? The best advice is to eat a balanced diet but exercise can also help. ""If you have a meal and then you exercise, then you're going to start to burn that meal,"" says Matt. ""So say you eat a very high fat meal or a sugary meal, you can start to remove the negative effects by going for a walk afterwards.""

"Repeated headers during a footballer's professional career may be linked to long-term brain damage, according to tentative evidence from UK scientists. The research follows anecdotal reports that players who head balls may be more prone to developing dementia later in life. The Football Association says it will look at this area more closely. Experts said recreational players were unlikely to incur problems. Damage ""covered up"" says Ian St John Dawn Astle, the daughter of former England and West Brom striker Jeff Astle, who died aged 59 suffering from early onset dementia, said it was ""obvious that it [his dementia] was linked to his footballing career"". The inquest into his death in 2002 found that repeatedly heading heavy leather footballs had contributed to trauma to his brain. Ms Astle told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""At the coroner's inquest, football tried to sweep his death under a carpet. They didn't want to know, they didn't want to think that football could be a killer and sadly, it is. It can be."" She said her father was 55 and physically very fit when he went to the doctor, who diagnosed him with the early onset of dementia. By the end he ""didn't even know he'd ever been a footballer"", she said, before adding: ""Everything football ever gave him, football had taken away."" This video can not be played Jeff Astle's daughter tells Today it's ""unforgivable"" the problem was ignored for so long Researchers from University College London and Cardiff University examined the brains of five people who had been professional footballers and one who had been a committed amateur throughout his life. They had played football for an average of 26 years and all six went on to develop dementia in their 60s. While performing post mortem examinations, scientists found signs of brain injury - calledchronic traumatic encephalopathy,external(CTE) in four cases. CTE has been linked to memory loss, depression and dementia and has been seen in other contact sports. Prof Huw Morris, of University College London, told the BBC: ""When we examined their brains at autopsy we saw the sorts of changes that are seen in ex-boxers, the changes that are often associated with repeated brain injury which are known as CTE. ""So really for the first time in a series of players we have shown that there is evidence that head injury has occurred earlier in their life which presumably has some impact on them developing dementia."" In the study, published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, the report's authors make it clear they were not analysing the risks of heading by children. Jeff Astle won five caps for England and played in the 1970 World Cup Finals But the science is far from clear-cut. Each brain also showed signs of Alzheimer's disease and some had blood vessel changes that can also lead to dementia. Researchers speculate that it was a combination of factors that contributed to dementia in these players. But they acknowledge their research cannot definitively prove a link between football and dementia and are calling for larger studies to look at footballers' long-term brain health. There are many different types of dementia - Alzheimer's is the most common form Dr David Reynolds, at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The causes of dementia are complex and it is likely that the condition is caused by a combination of age, lifestyle and genetic factors. ""Further research is needed to shed light on how lifestyle factors such as playing sport may alter dementia risk, and how this sits in the context of the well-established benefits of being physically active."" He added that for people who are recreational footballers, football injuries are unlikely to cause long-term problems and he pointed to expert advice that the benefit of exercise is likely to outweigh the risks. A number of previous cases involving boxers and American footballers have suggested that repetitive blows can cause long-lasting and progressive brain damage. But until now there have only been a few case reports of individual footballers with CTE in the UK and the extent of the issue is still unknown. The Football Association welcomed the study and said research was particularly needed to find out whether degenerative brain disease is more common in ex-footballers. Dr Charlotte Cowie, of the FA, added: ""The FA is determined to support this research and is also committed to ensuring that any research process is independent, robust and thorough, so that when the results emerge, everyone in the game can be confident in its findings.""
