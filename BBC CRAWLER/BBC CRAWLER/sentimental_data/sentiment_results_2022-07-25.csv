"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We need three things: growth, growth, growth"". Sir Keir Starmer has promised Labour would make delivering ""strong, secure and fair"" growth its main priority if it won power. In a speech, the Labour leader attacked the Tories for creating a ""brittle"" economy succeeding in ""too few places"". He announced his party would set up a new advisory body to help boost long-term growth. It comes as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss trade blows over the economy in the Conservative leadership race. In his speech in Liverpool, Sir Keir criticised the ""Thatcherite cosplay"" on display in the contest and accused the Conservatives of ""clinging to the old ideas"". Both Tory leadership candidates have ruled out calling a snap election if they enter Downing Street. The next election has to take place by January 2025 at the latest. Truss says Tory economic policy choked off growth What are the leadership candidates promising? In his speech, Sir Keir said ""growth, growth and growth"" was required to generate revenue for public services and make workers feel ""fairly rewarded"". Taking a swipe at the Tory leadership hopefuls, he said former chancellor Mr Sunak was ""the architect of the cost-of-living crisis,"" and Foreign Secretary Ms Truss was ""the latest graduate from the school of magic money tree economics"". As part of his party's economic strategy, he said Labour would not ""announce a single penny of day-to-day spending without saying how we would pay for it,"" and would ""invest to meet the challenges of the future"". Sir Keir said his party would set up an Industrial Strategy Council to set out ""strategic national priorities that go beyond the political cycle"". He added that the council's role would be established in law, drawing on the expertise of business, science, and unions, providing advice to politicians and holding them to account. He also said it was possible to see economic growth while achieving the UK's target to hit net-zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere would be balanced by the amount removed. ""We will not be distracted by the siren calls - from the right or the left - that say economic growth and net-zero do not go together,"" Sir Keir pledged. He promised he would ""challenge my party's instincts"", with a focus ""as much about growth and productivity, as we have done in the past about redistribution and investment"". But Sir Keir has been challenged from the left of his party, with some calling on him to fight the next election on platform of renationalising public utilities. Writing in the Guardian,external, former shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the renationalisation policies in the party's 2019 manifesto were popular and it the party needs to stay ""on the side of public opinion here"". Pressed on whether he would renationalise energy and water firms, Sir Keir said he would take a ""pragmatic"" not ""ideological approach"". Sir Keir Starmer's speech made clear that the re-nationalisation of industries should no longer be considered a priority, or even a policy, for Labour. He's talked recently about a ""clean slate"" after the party's 2019 manifesto which proposed to take water, energy and broadband industries into public ownership. When running for leader, Sir Keir pledged to support ""common ownership"" but recently said he was ""not in favour of nationalisation"". The view now from the top of the party is that re-nationalisation would not provide the economic growth the UK needs and investment in public services is a greater priority. Sir Keir - who today admitted this approach would challenge his party's instincts - faces his own challenge to convince those in his party who see his as the wrong approach. Meanwhile, the economy has become a key battleground in the Tory leadership race, with Mr Sunak describing Ms Truss's plan to borrow money to fund immediate tax cuts as a ""fairytale"". But Ms Truss criticised tax increases introduced by her former cabinet colleague Mr Sunak, arguing they ""choked off"" growth. She said the economic policies of previous Conservative and Labour governments over the past 20 years have not delivered growth. Both candidates have suggested their proposals would be approved of by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The pair will go head-to-head in a live TV debate later -Our Next Prime Minister will be broadcast on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Monday.

"A Ryanair boss has criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they had ""had one job to do to"". Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"". His comments come as staff shortages at airports have led to major disruption and cancellations in recent months. Airports said they had been recruiting security staff since late last year. A spokesperson for the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh, said: ""The vast majority of passengers across the UK are now getting away on their holidays with no or minimal disruption."" The spokesperson added that it was ""essential"" the industry worked together to fill the remaining vacancies, including for airline ground handling staff. Mr Sorahan, who said Ryanair was having a ""phenomenal"" summer as the airline posted profits of â¬170m (Â£145m) for the three months to the end of June, told the BBC's Today programme the ""biggest issue"" the company had faced was ""air traffic control disruptions all across Europe"". ""You have to hold ANSPs [air navigation service providers] and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up appropriately for that,"" he said. ""Equally the airports themselves, they had one job to do to and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and security staff. They had the schedules months in advance. ""We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their planning better next year."" Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled?

After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with resurgent demand. Airlines have been blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage, while airports have also been criticised for not being able to cater for more flights. Meanwhile, aviation industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic. The industry has also been threatened by strike action, with many staff demanding pay rises to cope with the rising cost of living. Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic, but said it had agreed deals with more than 80% of its pilots and about 70% of cabin crews. ""We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future,"" the group said. Mr Sorahan told the BBC that any strike action that had taken place had a ""minimal impact"" on services. Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and EasyJet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary previously told the BBC that the company's ""strong balance sheet"" going into the pandemic enabled it to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of Covidso they were able to ramp up operations when restrictions were lifted. There have been delays and long queues at airports in the last few months Mr Sorahan said Ryanair was ""fully staffed"" and operating more than 3,000 flights a day as many people venture on their first summer holiday since pandemic restrictions were lifted. Ryanair said it remained ""confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families"". The airline said its passenger numbers had rebounded to 45.5 million - 9% higher than before the Covid pandemic - but its first quarter profits were still short of pre-Covid levels. The company said its fuel costs had soared by 560% to â¬1bn and added the Ukraine war had ""badly damaged"" Easter bookings and fares. Mr O'Leary said in a statement on the company's results that unpredictability around fuel prices, the risk of new Covid variants and the war in Ukraine meant the company was unable to forecast a profit for the full financial year. ""While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in autumn 2022. Our experience... shows how fragile the travel market remains,"" he said. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up?

"The two remaining candidates for Conservative Party leader - and prime minister - sparred over tax and earrings during a BBC debate on Monday. What did audience members - made up of people who voted for the Tories in the last general election - make of it? Sarah Lind is concerned about the cost of living. She's five months pregnant with two children at home - so came into the debate wondering what the candidates could offer her to ease the pain of price rises. The trained economist says she knows the choices facing whoever enters No 10 in September are anything other than easy - but while she thinks she knows Rishi Sunak well, Liz Truss is something of an enigma. ""I didn't know a lot about Liz at all,"" she says. ""I wanted to hear from her and with Rishi I felt I know what I was getting."" Nonetheless, she's open minded about the two candidates - so which one stood out? After the debate, Sarah speaks about Ms Truss far more than Mr Sunak. ""It did change my mind yes,"" she says of the debate. ""I have a better understanding of Liz now."" The real and tangible benefits of the tax cuts promised by Ms Truss are a real driver for Sarah. She says she's already thinking about the implications they might have on her upcoming maternity leave. ""But then I agree we should be insulating our houses more,"" she adds. The candidates' comments about outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck with Sarah - she appreciated that neither tried to disown him, and Ms Truss resisted the opportunity to ""stab him while he's down"". And Sarah loved Ms Truss's concession towards the end that she was not the most polished performer. ""It was a clever thing to say,"" she says. ""Rishi was very rehearsed."" Warehouse manager Brendan Turner says his main concern is the cost of living, too. He's worried for colleagues on the minimum wage - who he says are struggling. In fact, it's not just those on the lowest pay - he says everyone is feeling the pinch. ""Stagnating pay is a big issue - I am seeing people struggle,"" he says. Not only that, it's proving hard to recruit people, he says. ""Everyone wants a decent wage."" As for both candidates - neither stand out to him yet. So with tax one of the key battlegrounds of the debate - what's Brendan's verdict? He says Rishi Sunak was definitely the ""smoother... sharper"" performer and he thinks Liz Truss ""struggled to hold her own"". That said, he notes how Mr Sunak talked over his rival at times. So how would this go down in Brendan's house? ""It could be seen as confident or rude,"" he says, diplomatically. He says Mr Sunak had ""compelling arguments"" on the cost of living and tax. But there's no really clear winner for him - and it remains to be seen if either would get his vote in a general election, he says. Krystian Belicki is a trainee NHS mental health therapist, and says he and his partner, a teacher, are worried about the cost-of-living crisis and the prospect of below-inflation pay increases. He also mentions the rising NHS backlog - especially in his mental health specialism. While Rishi Sunak is more familiar, Krystian says he is keen to hear more from Liz Truss directly. Aside from all the political issues, he is also interested in their character - after Boris Johnson's tumultuous time in office. ""I want to see what they have to say - I'm open minded,"" the 24-year-old says. Once out of the debate hall, Krystian says he and his partner have decided to put off having children due to the cost of living crisis. The difficult decision was made in light of worsening economic forecasts - so what did the candidates have to offer? He feels Rishi Sunak was the most ""compelling"" candidate. He repeats Mr Sunak's analogy of putting the cost of tax cuts onto the nation's ""credit card"" - an attack used against Liz Truss - word-for-word. But in terms of concrete solutions - there were few he could mention. Ms Truss, meanwhile, ""made good arguments"", but Krystian notes it was Mr Sunak who came to say hello to the audience before the debate. Benji Rea spoke before the debate of the maturity required by any successful candidate for Conservative leader. He said he thought the contest thus far had been akin to ""playground insult hurling"". The 22-year-old Staffordshire University student and party member said: ""I am waiting for someone to grow up, take it on the chin and say what they want to do with the party. Whatever happens - and whoever does this first - is where my vote will go."" ""For me - the maturity of the candidates is important. When I looked at Boris Johnson I saw a party leader, I saw a leader and a man who can win a general election. I want to make sure my vote has the best chance of winning a tough election."" Benji admitted to being ""quite on the fence"" ahead of the BBC debate, adding: ""I am very open to seeing how the debates go and seeing what they deliver."" Reflecting afterwards on the performance of both Mr Sunak and Ms Truss, Benji says: ""Overall, the debate felt significantly more mature, despite Mr Sunak being quick to interrupt Ms Truss, and serves as an excellent starting point for a long summer of campaigning. ""It's given me a lot to think about and research myself and has really painted both candidates in a good light for the leadership race ahead."" But despite the strong performances, he says he has yet to decide which candidate to back. Who might it be? Whichever candidate ""steps up and demonstrates their potential to lead this party through a turbulent and unprecedented future,"" he says.

"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak held their first head-to-head debate as part of the race to succeed Boris Johnson as Conservative leader and prime minister. Here we look at some of the claims they made. Ms Truss said this when asked how she would fund her plans for a series of tax cuts - one of the dividing lines between her and Mr Sunak. Fiscal headroom is a term for the amount extra that the government could spend without breaking its own rules on borrowing. After the spring statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility concluded that Mr Sunak's policies as chancellor had left about Â£30bn of fiscal headroom. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out that inflation will eat into that figure. For example, the government's increases to public sector pay will cost billions. Meanwhile, surging inflation led interest payments on UK government debt to hit Â£19.1bn in June, the highest amount on record. When asked how he would help households with the rising cost of living, Mr Sunak focused on cutting energy bills by helping millions of homes with insulation installation. Mr Sunak is right that without proper insulation households eitheruse more energy to heat and cool their homes, or for those in fuel poverty they can be forced to live in cold, damp and potentially unhealthy homes. TheEnergy Savings Trust estimates,externalthat loft insulation could save a terraced house Â£230 a year on energy bills  - but it also would cost Â£500 to install - hence the need for government support. However, over the last decade installation rates have fallen. The UK government's advisory body on climate change, the UKCCC,estimated,externalthere were just 27,000 lofts insulated in 2020 compared to 1.6 million in 2012. When Mr Sunak was Chancellor at the Treasury,he announcedthe green homes grant scheme, which offered Â£10,000 to homes to help install insulation measures. But then it was scrapped less than a year later after achieving just 10% of its target. The Environment Audit Committee said the ""botched"" scheme must be reformed as ""investment to improve energy efficiency has been woefully inadequate."" Then, two weeks later theTelegraph reported,externalthat the Treasury blocked proposals by Kwasi Kwarteng as Business Secretary to expand the Energy Company Obligation - an energy efficiency scheme to help low income households. However, more recentlyin his Spring StatementMr Sunak did remove VAT on energy efficiency materials for homeowners including insulation. The UK has secured trade agreements with over 60 countries since the Brexit vote. However, the vast majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new benefits. Two deals have been negotiated from scratch - with Australia and New Zealand.  The UK's government's own estimate says the Australia deal could increase the UK's GDP by0.08% over 15 years.,external The UK has also negotiated several deals that build on existing EU deals, such as the one with Japan. How many trade deals has the UK signed? This was in the section of the debate when both candidates had to give one-word answers and were asked whether Brexit was to blame for the ""huge queues"" seen at Dover and Folkestone. They denied this but Brexit is one of the main factors involved. When the UK was in the EU, there was much less need for rigorous checks at these ports because UK citizens could travel freely around the EU. This ""freedom of movement"" ended with Brexit and now French officials - at Dover and Folkestone - have to stamp and check passports. The change means more staff and bigger facilities are now required to make the checks. This can take up to a minute per person - according to travel expert Simon Calder - rather than a few seconds (under the old system). Other factors that contributed to the travel disruption included an initial shortage of French border staff at Dover on Friday. What caused the travel chaos at Dover? Ahead of the leadership debate, Rishi Sunaktweeted,externala series of tough new measures he would introduce as prime minister to ""face down"" China. His proposals included closing all 30 Confucius Institutes in the UK and empowering MI5 to help tackle industrial espionage. Mr Sunak's position on China has not always been so stark. Speaking as chancellor in aspeech,externallast year, Mr Sunak called for a ""mature and balanced relationship"" with China in order to ""pursue with confidence an economic relationship [..] in a safe, mutually beneficial way"". In June 2020 Mr Sunak was reportedly one of several cabinet members whowarned Boris Johnson against breaking economic ties with China,externalover security concerns with the 5G network supplier, Huawei. Mr Sunak's past support for a closer trading relationship with China has been acknowledged by Chinese state-owned newspaperGlobal Times,external, who described his approach as ""clear and pragmatic"". But Ms Truss has also changed her position, having said in 2016 that relations with China were entering a ""golden era"". What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Social media is a key battleground in any election - even one with a very small electorate. How are Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss trying to win over the Tory members who will choose the next PM? They are two very different characters, with two very different campaigning styles. ""Everything about Sunak's approach is slick,"" says PR expert Mark Borkowski. ""It is overly professional in some points. I am not sure whether that is a good or a bad thing. There seems to be a lot of strategy and thinking behind it."" The Truss campaign on the other hand ""feels a little bit more homespun"", he adds. Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Sunak's social media strategy is masterminded by Cass Horowitz, son of best-selling novelist Anthony Horowitz. As a special adviser to Sunak when he was chancellor, Horowitz used fancy graphics and clever tag lines to sell ""Brand Rishi"" to a younger, politically unengaged audience on Instagram. Theglossy ""origin story"" video,externalSunak used to launch his leadership campaign on Twitter - in which he talked about how his mother came to the UK in the early 1960s ""armed with hope for a better life"" - has been viewed more than 8 million times. Rishi Sunak's back story video has been viewed more than 8 million times So slick was this film that it raised suspicions that it had been in the works for some time - a suspicion shared by Mark Borkowski, who notes: ""You don't create this sort of campaign overnight"". Team Sunak insist the video was put together in 24 hours, after Boris Johnson announced he was standing down. Liz Truss's social team, run by Reuben Solomon, former head of digital at the Conservative Party, and a protege of Boris Johnson's favourite election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, have played it safer so far. Theforeign secretary's launch film,externalis an attempt to project her as an international stateswoman. There is little about her own back story, and no spontaneous ""behind the scenes"" footage. There is much talk about ""delivery"". Liz Truss projects herself as an international stateswoman who is ready to lead One similarity between the two candidates - and indeed all of the Tory MPs who threw their hats into the leadership ring - is their desire to be on first name terms with the electorate. This is not a smart move, according to Anthony Ridge-Newman, associate professor of media and communication at Liverpool Hope University. ""Boris Johnson is one of the few politicians to ever be referred to commonly by his first name. The online campaign slogans, both Liz for Leader; and Ready for Rishi, are an attempt to emulate Boris's first name appeal. ""Had either of the Tory leadership candidates come to me for my expert advice, I would have suggested foregrounding their last names, Sunak and Truss. ""It would help their campaigns appear more prime ministerial, which, if I know anything about the Conservative Party, is something they look for in their candidates."" Rishi Sunak reacts to news that he has made the final two, in a campaign video Rishi Sunak's use of video has been more adventurous, with candid, supposedly off-the-cuff footage of him reacting to key moments. There was even an unexpected venture into comedy, with a parody of 1930s cinema newsreel, in a video trumpeting his Brexiteer credentials. But neither candidate is a natural in front of the camera or the smartphone, in Ridge-Newman's opinion, lacking the fluency of Boris Johnson or David Cameron. ""Sunak's digital content is largely presenting him to be a regular guy,"" which may be an attempt to neutralise recent media portrayals of him as a member of the wealthy ""elite"". he says. Team Sunak venture into parody with an early social video ""Truss on the other hand is presenting herself in a more statuesque manner. The digital content comes across quite posed and generic, and plays on her role, time and successes as foreign secretary. ""While Truss does not come across as a digital native, her social media campaign seems as though it is most strategically steered towards the Conservative Party membership, who are the ones who will be voting to decide Britain's next prime minister."" Liz Truss emphasises 'delivery' in her launch video One problem for Team Truss is that memes making fun of their candidate have been shared far more than anything produced by the campaign. ""She seems to be the one suffering from a lot of parody,"" says Mark Borkowski. So far, Google searches for ""Liz Truss"" have far outranked those for ""Rishi Sunak"", but they are often accompanied by the word ""cheese"". This is a reference to a2015 conference speech. in which he she says, in an impassioned voice: ""We import two-thirds of our cheese. That. Is. A. Disgrace."" Mr Sunak has also attracted derision on social media, with Labour supporters and others sharing a clip of him as a teenager talking about how he has no working class friends. The Truss campaign quotes the Daily Mail in a social media post But ultimately this is not a campaign that will be won and lost on social media. As theBBC's Media Editor Amol Rajan has pointed out, the Tory membership are ""a narrow section of the population that is much more attuned to newsprint than most Britons"". And Liz Truss appears to have one of the UK's biggest-selling papers The Daily Mail in her corner, which could prove decisive for her. ""In this old-fashioned newspaper election, the tenor of newsprint coverage over the next week could have a significant impact on who becomes prime minister - especially if the Times, Sun and Telegraph decide that, like the Mail, they know who they want, and give hell to whosoever they decide they don't want,"" says Amol Rajan.

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""  Liz Truss has also tweeted her support for TalkTV host Kate McCann, after the presenter fainted while hosting the leadership debate. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Our Next Prime Minister - BBC debate highlights Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss tore into each other over their rival visions for the future of the UK economy, in their first head-to-head TV debate. The two contenders to be the next PM did not hold back from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks in the hour-long BBC special. Mr Sunak told Ms Truss her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Ms Truss said tax rises brought in by him would lead to a recession. The foreign secretary and former chancellor, who until three weeks ago were in the same cabinet, talked over each other at times and shot angry glances across the stage at Stoke-on-Trent's Victoria Hall. It led to complaints afterwards by Ms Truss's supporters that the ex-chancellor was being too aggressive and was ""mansplaining"" - something fiercely denied by the Sunak camp. The pair were on better terms by the end of the debate, with Ms Truss saying she would ""love"" to have Mr Sunak on her team if she becomes PM. The ex-chancellor praised her stance on Russia. But the row over tax dominated the early exchanges. Five takeaways from a heated Truss-Sunak clash How accurate are Tory leadership polls? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss wants to scrap the rise to National Insurance, a planned rise in corporation tax and would temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills to be paid for through borrowing. Mr Sunak says he would not cut taxes until inflation was under control. Mr Sunak - who quit as chancellor earlier this month - said the coronavirus pandemic had created a large bill and that putting it on the ""country's credit card"" would ""pass the tab to our children and grandchildren"". This video can not be played Watch: Sunak and Truss angrily debate borrowing and debt Ms Truss insisted that under her plans the UK would start paying down the debt in three year's time - and paying it back straight away as Mr Sunak wanted to do would push the UK into a recession. Mr Sunak suggested her plans would lead to higher interest rates, but the foreign secretary dismiss this as ""scaremongering"" and ""project fear"" - an echo of the criticism aimed at the Remain campaign during Brexit referendum. Mr Sunak took this opportunity to point out that, unlike him, Ms Truss campaigned against Brexit. ""Maybe I learnt from that,"" she replied. She later said the Brexit referendum was when she had learnt not to trust Treasury forecasts on the economy. Other key moments in the debate included: Both candidates accusing the other of not having been tough enough on China in the past Ms Truss contrasting her comprehensive school education with that of Mr Sunak's, who attended the fee-paying Winchester College Mr Sunak said he was ""not going to apologise"" for his background, adding that his parents' aspirational values were Conservative - something that earned him the evening's first round of applause Mr Sunak's resignation as chancellor helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson. He praised Mr Johnson's handling of Brexit and the pandemic but said he had quit as a matter of principle over the PM's ""conduct"" and the fact that they had ""very different views about the direction of travel on the economy"". Ms Truss acknowledged the prime minister had made mistakes but said they were not ""sufficient"" enough for the Conservative Party to have ""rejected him"". Neither said they would accept Mr Johnson in their cabinet. Chief secretary to the Treasury and Truss-backer Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that polling after the debate showed the majority of Conservative voters thought his candidate had won the evening - and it had reaffirmed his view that she was the right candidate to lead the country. He refused to criticise Mr Sunak for interrupting, but said viewers would have to make up their own minds about his debating style. He added he thought Ms Truss had been ""cool, controlled"" and had made compelling arguments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast the debate showed a Conservative Party which had ""lost the plot and lost its purpose"". He said Mr Sunak was acting like he had ""just come down from the moon"" and discovered the economy was in a bad way when he had been in charge of it until three weeks ago, while Ms Truss was playing ""fantasy economics"" without explaining how she would pay for tax cuts. ""We do need change in the UK but the change we need is not a change at the top of the Conservative Party, it is more fundamental than that. We need a fresh start for Britain. We need a Labour government,"" he said. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson simply said: ""Eurgh."" For all the talk of wanting the ""blue-on-blue"" attacks to subside - this debate showed they haven't gone away. Liz Truss's campaign accused Rishi Sunak of not letting her get a word in edgeways, and Rishi Sunak continued to slam Liz Truss's tax cut plans for not being economically sound. Sources close to Sunak said he had ""won the argument"" on the economy, with his argument that her tax cuts would further fuel inflation and push up interest rates and people's mortgages. Behind the scenes, Truss's camp feel positive too - claiming that while she stayed calm Sunak was ""flustered"". Debates about their backgrounds haven't gone away either. Both are keen to distance themselves from any suggestion they had certain privileges. Truss pointed to her comprehensive school education but distanced herself slightly, though, from the outright attacks on Sunak's clothing and education from some of her supporters. But the key battleground - and the biggest dividing line between the two - is still tax. What questions do you have about the Tory Leadership debate?

"Lord Trimble, former first minister of Northern Ireland and Ulster Unionist Party leader, has died at the age of 77 Politicians and others have been paying tribute to the former Nobel Peace prize winner for his role in the Good Friday Agreement and beyond. Tonight's news will cause deep sadness throughout Northern Ireland and much further afield. Â David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland. He will forever be associated with the leadership he demonstrated in the negotiations that led up to the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster. Â He will be remembered as a first minister, as a Peer of the Realm and as a Nobel Prize Winner. He will also be remembered as a great unionist. David Trimble's life has left an indelible mark on our shared island's story. Over the course of his political career, but particularly in difficult years of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, he demonstrated immense courage and took political risks that sustained the life of our fledgling peace process. He doesn't often enough get credit for it, but without David Trimble's fortitude, there would simply have been no agreement. The image of David and Seamus Mallon walking through Poyntzpass together in 1998 to comfort the families of Damien Trainor and Philip Allen is an enduring icon of the peace process that inspired a whole generation of people who wanted, and needed, to believe that our shared future could be different from our divided past. It is my enduring memory of his commitment to reconciliation. My thoughts and prayers are with Daphne, Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah at this difficult time. I hope they are comforted by the immense legacy that David left to the people of Northern Ireland. *The SDLP has announced itwill postpone its assembly recall motion scheduled for Tuesday. What I found in dealing with David Trimble, including when I served as deputy first minister alongside him in office, was the term doable counted a lot with him. He would tell you things were out because they weren't doable, and then the calculus would change and he would decide things were doable and even though it was going to be risky and difficult, if it was doable, he was going to go for it. Unless he as the leader of the main unionist parties was going to go for the [Good Friday] Agreement, even though it entailed risks for him, even though it had real challenges, unless he was going to go for the agreement, one, there wouldn't have been an agreement, and two, it certainly wouldn't have got endorsement at the referendum. My sympathies to Daphne who I know very well and the children and to his friends. He was courageous. I had many a row, many arguments and in more recent years we had good laughs about those debates. As a good negotiator when he made a deal, when he settled something, he stuck by it. He stuck by it subsequently and he paid a price, he lost his seat in Upper Bann, he got a lot of criticism from his wider unionist family. He was a good guy and he stood firmly by what he believed in and I had a long chat with him just a few weeks ago in Queen's [University] and he knew what was coming. He was brave in that, as he was in everything else. ""David Trimble, in his support of the peace process, showed politics at its very best. When some within his own ranks were opposed to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, he supported it. When we needed his willingness to go the extra mile for peace, he travelled that mile. When there was the prospect of collapse of the process without strong leadership, he provided that leadership. ""His contribution to Northern Ireland and to the United Kingdom was immense, unforgettable and frankly irreplaceable. ""Whatever disagreements we had - and there were quite a few - I never had anything other than profound respect for David as a person and as a Leader. ""My deepest condolences to Daphne and his family. ""We have lost today someone who will be mourned by friends and foes alike."" I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lord Trimble earlier today. He was a giant of British and international politics and will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better. A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and a leading architect of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, he championed democracy over violence, and played a huge role in setting Northern Ireland on the path to peace. My thoughts are with David's wife Daphne and their children at this difficult time. They should know that David's legacy and achievements will never be forgotten by the people of the United Kingdom. As President of Ireland, I wish to express my deep sadness at hearing the news of the passing of David Trimble, former First Minister of Northern Ireland and former Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. Sabina joins me in expressing our profound sympathy to Mrs Daphne Trimble and to all of David's family, friends and colleagues. Lord Trimble will be remembered for a life of public service, and of course for his most significant contribution to the work for peace on our island. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize, together with John Hume, following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement almost 25 years ago, was part of the recognition by so many of their work for peace. David Trimble's dedication and courage, often during the most challenging times, has earned him a distinguished and deserved place in our history books. His work leaves a true legacy on the necessity and value of peace on our shared island for future generations. I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of David Trimble. He played a key role as leader of the UUP, and his was a long and distinguished career in unionist politics and in the politics of Northern Ireland. All of us in politics at the time witnessed his crucial and courageous role in the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and his leadership in building support in his party and his community for the agreement. Fittingly, his contribution was recognised internationally and most notably by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to himself and John Hume ""for their joint efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland"". As the first, first Minister of Northern Ireland, he began the arduous work of bedding down the executive and delivering for the people of Northern Ireland. In his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Trimble spoke about the ""politicians of the possible"", a phrase which I think sums up the David Trimble we all knew, and it speaks to his achievements over many decades, often in challenging circumstances. The work of reconciliation begun in the Good Friday Agreement continues, and as new generations pick up the mantle of this work, it is fitting that we pay tribute to Lord Trimble for his central contribution in setting us on the path to peace and reconciliation. David faced huge challenges when he led the Ulster Unionist Party in the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and persuaded his party to sign on for it. It is to his credit that he supported that agreement. I thank him for that. In the years immediately following the agreement, I met David many times. Our conversations were not always easy, but we made progress. We used to meet quite often on our own and I got to know him quite well. While we held fundamentally different political opinions on the way forward nonetheless I believe he was committed to making the peace process work. David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated. I want to extend my sincerest condolences to Daphne Trimble, their daughters Victoria and Sarah, their sons Richard and Nicholas and to the entire family circle. It is with genuine regret that I have learned of the passing of Former First Minister David Trimble. I wish to offer my sincere condolences to his wife Daphne, their four children and the wider family circle who will feel his loss deeply. His very significant contribution to the peace process and his courage in helping achieve the Good Friday Agreement leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud. I am deeply saddened to learn of David's passing and my thoughts are foremost with Daphne and their children at this painful time of loss. He made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom. Throughout some of the most difficult years of the Troubles, David was a committed and passionate advocate for the Union, at a time when doing so placed a considerable threat to his safety. Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time. He was a committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland. Right until recent days David continued to use his political skill and intellect, most recently in support of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union and in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. As a Nobel laureate, his words carried significant weight and he helped raise awareness of the threat the protocol posed to Northern Ireland, particularly amongst the wider UK audience. He leaves a huge and lasting legacy to Northern Ireland. He can undoubtedly be said to have shaped history in our country. My thoughts are with the friends and family of Lord Trimble My sympathies are also with his former colleagues in the UUP. Lord Trimble's greatest legacy to his political career is the Good Friday Agreement and the risks he took to both help achieve it, and ensuring the resulting assembly remained during its unsteady early days. It was at times an unenviable role. I am greatly saddened to learn of the passing of Lord David Trimble and wish to express to Lady Trimble and the family sincere condolences. Though politically we fundamentally disagreed over the Belfast Agreement, latterly as joint applicants in the Judicial Review challenge to the Protocol we shared a common determination to rid Northern Ireland of this iniquitous assault on our constitutional position. David had a very clear and correct view of the dangers and unacceptability of the Protocol. I have known David and Daphne Trimble since my university days when David was one of my lecturers and Daphne was a fellow student in my law year. As a couple throughout their married life, Daphne gave exemplary support to David and in his declining health was a tower of strength to him. So, in losing David, Daphne has suffered a great loss and Northern Ireland has lost a foremost thinker within unionism. The loss of David Trimble will be felt deeply throughout Northern Ireland. My heart goes out to his family and friends. He will be remembered for his unshaking defence of peace, and his leadership in helping deliver the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. David Trimble was a towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics as one of the key authors of the Good Friday Agreement, the first First Minister and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. My thoughts are with Lady Trimble and their family. Deeply saddened to hear of the death of former Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble. David was a great figure, instrumental in delivering the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the optimistic Northern Ireland of today. My thoughts are with his family at this time. He [Trimble] was a giant of Unionism and he helped bring peace to Northern Ireland as an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, and he was a deserved winner of the Nobel Peace prize. I'm sure everyone's thoughts will be with his family tonight. David Trimble took enormous personal and political risks for peace. He put the future of Northern Ireland before his party's interests and sought to make Northern Ireland a warmer house for all who lived there. He was not always right, but he worked to take violence out of politics to strengthen the centre ground. For that, he and John Hume jointly won the Nobel Prize. Rest in peace. Deeply saddened at the death of Lord Trimble. Working together in the Talks, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the House of Lords, I saw him face testing times and profound challenges with great courage and integrity. Present and future generations owe him more than they know. The Hume Foundation is deeply saddened at the passing of Lord David Trimble. David Trimble demonstrated genuine and courageous leadership during the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement 24 years ago. Our sincere sympathies to all his family. Remembering David Trimble's wife and family in prayer. Whilst a strong representative of his party, he had courage to lead, and to persuade others to take historic steps forward for peace and reconciliation. For this we owe him a sincere debt of gratitude. David Trimble showed leadership at a time when Northern Ireland so badly needed it. All politicians from all traditions should be inspired by his courage. My thoughts tonight are with his family, his wife Daphne, his UUP colleagues and unionist community.

"""Is he the guy from Friends?,"" one voter asks while looking at a photo of one of the candidates vying to be the country's next prime minister. As Stoke-on-Trent prepares to host a debate for the Tory leadership, you could say neither Rishi Sunak nor Liz Truss are really cutting through. Not for the first time, the city is proving a key political battleground for the Conservative Party. Whoever takes over needs to be retaining former red wall seats like these. The two candidates willappear live on BBC One laterto be put through their paces by Sophie Raworth in front of a live studio audience. Stoke-on-Trent is a key political battleground after flipping from Labour to the Conservatives in 2019 The constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent North and Central are areas which flipped from Labour to Conservative in 2019. An important question for Ms Truss and Mr Sunak is how can they capitalise on the party's popularity under Boris Johnson in areas like this - is it through policy or personality? If the latter, they could be in trouble. In Hanley, the heart of Jo Gideon's Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency, people I stopped to speak to had trouble naming the final two from photographs. When shown Mr Sunak, answers included: ""Is he the guy from Friends?"" Few managed to name Liz Truss but guessed she worked in politics. Sophie Gardener had concerns over both candidates' records over Covid-19 Shopping in Hanley town centre, Sophie Gardener recognises the photograph of Mr Sunak but pointing at Ms Truss, she says she's not sure who she is. She knows Rishi Sunak was in charge of the country's finances and added: ""It worries me slightly the fact that both have been involved with the Covid lead up and neither have been entirely successful. ""But it is what it is and somebody has to win."" If their personalities aren't winning them over, can the candidates do it with policies? How would they help people living here? Stoke-on-Trent has high levels of deprivation and locals are keen to hear more about government plans for levelling up This was a Brexit voting area: In the 2016 referendum 69% who cast their vote did so to leave the European Union. Boris Johnson pledged to ""get Brexit done"" and for many in Stoke-on-Trent, he was a man of his word. But there is a bigger discussion now - levelling up. Mr Johnson called it the ""defining mission"" of his government and the aim was to give people and communities that feel they have been left behind a chance to catch up. Stoke-on-Trent received Â£56m to redevelop the area, with plans including building a 3,600-seat arena, 285 new homes and a three-star hotel. However, there has been little mention of what was a key theme of the Conservatives' 2019 election campaign from the two leadership contenders. Thomas Jameson says he wants both candidates to see what the city is like By the city's bus station, Thomas Jameson said he was pleased the two politicians would debate here. ""They can see what the city's like and how we live,"" he said. ""They can see what working life is like for people with the cost of living crisisâ¦ some people have to go to food banks."" Chris Mason: High stakes for Sunak and Truss before first debate Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Stoke-on-Trent has become a symbol of struggling Britain. It is characterised by high levels of deprivation where people queue for food banks and communities come together to help each other manage as cost of living pressures increase. The Indices of Multiple Deprivation for 2019 ranks the city as the 13th most deprived local authority area out of 317 in England. And the percentage of children living in poverty is about 24% - higher than the national average of 16%. Alex Banks says he agrees with levelling up and wants to see a strong community in Stoke-on-Trent Alex Banks said although he was not a Conservative voter, he broadly agreed with the principles of levelling up. ""I have a general sense of what levelling up means, strengthen the economy, strengthen the people,"" said the Staffordshire University student. ""Levelling up can mean many different things to many different people, so it's about levelling up in the right wayâ¦ building a strong community in Stoke-on-Trent and building infrastructure that helps."" Local politicians are also worried about the rising costs of inflation and the impact that has on the economic growth of the area and residents. The city's Conservative council leader Abi Brown has written to government to ask how levelling up will continue as financial pressures increase. Conservative votes are needed in ""red wall, left behind and in need of levelling up"" areas like Stoke-on-Trent, she said. ""To stay in No 10, places like ours matter.""

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have gone head-to-head for the first time in a live TV debate hosted by the BBC after a week of increasingly personal attacks. One of them will be the next Tory leader - and the UK's next prime minister - voted in by members of the Conservative Party. In an hour of testy exchanges covering economic policy, China and even earrings - what were the standout moments? The short answer is no (even if they sometimes pretended). Within minutes, the two candidates were at loggerheads - and once again it got very heated, with multiple interruptions. Mr Sunak needs to make up ground if the polls are to be believed. He tried to get on the front foot and make the case for his cautious economic strategy right away, accusing Ms Truss of risking a huge increase in interest rates with her plans to cut tax immediately. He repeatedly came back to this, accusing his rival of wanting a short-term sugar high, which would be followed by an economic crash. Ms Truss disputed Mr Sunak's claim and argued she'll start paying back debt within three years. She accused him of ""scaremongering"" (more on the Brexit rhetoric later). Both candidates did try to be nice at certain points. Mr Sunak said he admired Ms Truss. She said he had good dress sense (after her supporter, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, questioned the price of Mr Sunak's wardrobe - and contrasted it with Ms Truss's budget earrings). Despite the dress talk, there is a real battle for the ideological soul of the Conservative Party and there is a lot at stake. One of these two candidates will be prime minister in just over a month. But tonight was another example of how split the two candidates are on the party's future. A friendly exchange of ideas this was not - and you can see why some senior Conservatives are nervous about long-term damage being done to the party. With inflation at a 40-year high, economic policy has become the main battleground in this increasingly fractious leadership contest. Taking a combative tone, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss attacked each other's tax plans, producing some of the most explosive moments of the debate. Ms Truss has pledged about Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they would boost economic growth, while Mr Sunak has said he would only slash taxes once inflation was under control. Who gets to choose the next PM? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak policy guide What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Ms Truss said the UK was heading for a recession if the country followed Mr Sunak's economic plans. Visibly peeved and shaking his head at that, Mr Sunak shot back with a bullish retort. He insisted the tax burden - the highest for 70 years - was the result of the unprecedented levels of government spending needed to keep the economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Ms Truss's tax plans, Mr Sunak said: ""I don't think that's right, I don't think that's responsible, and I certainly don't think it's Conservative."" Squabbling ensued, with both candidates talking over each other, prompting moderator Sophie Raworth to intervene. A big debate on foreign policy has been on the UK's relationship with China. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss have been warning about the threat from the state. But they've also been clashing on who came to that conclusion first. It got heated here, too. Mr Sunak has been calling for a clampdown on Confucius Institutes in the UK. He denied having a dig at Ms Truss on this (she was an education minister when some of them opened). But he did suggest she had been on a ""journey"" when it came to China - arguing she had previously argued for a golden age in relations. Significantly, Ms Truss said she would like to see a clampdown on Chinese-owned companies like TikTok. There weren't any details - but many will be asking what measures she would introduce as prime minister. But she also tried to call out Mr Sunak - arguing that he was a recent convert to a clampdown on China. She said the Treasury had wanted closer ties when he was chancellor. Mr Sunak backed Brexit. Ms Truss backed remain, but has since become an enthusiastic supporter of life outside the EU. What was striking tonight was that Ms Truss used some of the language of the Leave campaign. In response to questions about her economic plans, she accused Mr Sunak of ""scaremongering"" and ""Project Fear"". That isn't just borrowing from the referendum handbook - it's a direct lift from the campaign. Mr Sunak was having none of it - reminding Ms Truss that he backed Leave, and so knew all about Project Fear. Speak to Tory MPs and many will admit their constituents aren't happy Mr Johnson is standing down. The spectre of the cabinet mutiny that brought the prime minister down is going to be a feature of the next few weeks. Mr Sunak is seen by some as betraying the prime minister. As a result, many of Mr Johnson's allies don't want the former chancellor to succeed him. Mr Sunak said tonight he was proud of the work he did in government, and resigning was a difficult decision he had made on principle. Ms Truss has the backing of some Johnson loyalists. She flagged tonight that she was an early backer of Mr Johnson and praised the ""brilliant job"" he did winning the 2019 general election. Significantly, she said tonight that the ""mistakes"" he made in office should not have brought him down. The debate ended with the quickfire round and one of the final questions was: what marks would you give Mr Johnson out of 10. Ms Truss said seven and then after some prevarication Mr Sunak came out with 10/10 for delivering Brexit - to some applause.

"The final two in the race to become prime minister are facing big challenges when it comes to the economy. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss need to set out how they plan to conquer inflation, avoid recession and help the public through a record fall in disposable income. I'm highlighting here three questions every member of the public will want an answer to as they hit the campaign trail. Their response will be considered by a far smaller group of people: Conservative Party members and the way they vote will also define which way the party is set to turn. Is it still a party about a small state, low taxes and the free market? Or has the big spending of the Covid era, coupled with promises of extra money for the NHS and talk of ""taking back control"", changed what it stands for? And what will that mean for the fundamental issues everybody is facing? Billions of pounds of support is already being given out to households, especially low income ones. But, since that help was announced, it's become clear bills will rise even further than originally expected,perhaps to over Â£3,300 a yearfor an average household. Some backbench MPs say households simply can't afford to pay bills at those levels, and are calling for more direct intervention to stop bills rising. Some are even suggesting breaking the link between bills and wholesale electricity and gas prices altogether. This would mean the government or suppliers paying for sudden cost rises and recouping the cost from customers over a longer period. Ultimately, the pandemic may have raised expectations about what role government should take in a crisis. But so far neither candidate has indicated they plan to do anything very radical. Rishi Sunak has not indicated any further help on bills beyond the existing support schemes he announced when chancellor. However, Liz Truss has said that she would reduce the ""green levies"" - these are the extra charges added to bills to help finance the switch to renewables. That could save bill-payers Â£153 a year. But the levies also help fund schemes to support poorer customers paying their energy bills, money that still needs to come from somewhere. And the crisis over energy could get even worse of course, if President Putin cuts off gas supplies to Europe. In that situation, could either of the candidates contemplate telling the public to ration energy use? For a few months last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's key message was that Britain deserved a pay rise. ""Wage growth"" would be the key measure of the success of his ""levelling up"" mission, he said. But very soon after, Mr Sunak's former department, the Treasury, clarified that wage rises would have to be justified by an increase in productivity. Both candidates for prime minister seem concerned that if wage settlements go above 5% that could prompt a spiral of rising wages and prices, locking in high inflation for years. And a recent round of public sector pay settlements pitched pay rises for nurses and the police at an average of around 4-5%, although lower paid staff are set for higher rises. While it is true that this is the largest cash rise in wages in two decades, as the government says, it is also true - as the unions point out - that it is one of the largest ever real cuts in wages ever seen. With inflation heading above 10%, any annual wage settlements below that represent a real-terms cut, a shrinkage of the value of what people are taking home at the end of the month. So public sector workers could see their take home pay shrink sharply in value under either of the candidates. Private sector pay settlements could of course be higher. And all pay packets would benefit from a policy advocated by the Truss campaign: to reverse April's National Insurance rise of 1.25%. Mr Sunak has played down the prospect of personal tax cuts before autumn 2023 if he becomes prime minister, warning that early reductions would risk exacerbating the rise in the cost of living. State pensions are due to go up by 10% in April as a result of the restoration of the ""triple lock"" policy, which guarantees the recent surge in inflation is reflected in pensioners' incomes. This will kick in, even if inflation has fallen back by then. Mr Sunak has spoken in favour of the rise, arguing that, unlike higher wages for public sector workers, it won't add to inflation. The government's official forecasters have pointed to the long term cost of this policy, as well as increasing spending on health and social care, but the candidates may well both stick to this policy of generosity towards the generation that's now in retirement. On the other hand they could cut back on the considerable tax breaks high earners currently enjoy when saving for their old age. That would raise billions for the exchequer. Or they could decide to raise the age at which the state pension is paid out. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that previous rise to 66 years effectively doubled pensioner poverty among 65 year olds. In this contest, what matters is how the candidates go down with around 160,000 Conservative Party members. But many of the promises made will set the course on the economy at a tricky time, affecting tens of millions more.

"This video can not be played ""I felt I was treated as a personal servant at times"" - cricketer Qasim Sheikh speaks following racism inquiry review An independent review into allegations of racism in Scottish cricket has found the governance and leadership of the sport to be institutionally racist. It also concluded that those who raised issues were ignored or side-lined and a culture of ""racially aggravated micro-aggression"" was allowed to develop. The review highlighted 448 examples that demonstrated institutional racism. It was commissioned by Sportscotland after a number of allegations were made last year. An anonymous survey was carried out as part of the review, with 62% of those who responded saying they had experienced, seen or had reported to them incidents of racism, inequalities or discrimination. Equality and diversity group Plan4Sport, which carried out the review for funding body Sportscotland, found: A lack of any equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) or anti-racist training in place for board, staff, volunteers, players, coaches or umpires; No consistent mechanism or process for handling racist incidents; A lack of diversity from board level to coaching; Lack of transparency in the selection process in the talent pathway and the absence of a single uniform approach to selection. The entireCricket Scotland board resigned on Sunday, ahead of the publication of the reportChanging the Boundaries,external. The operation of Cricket Scotland has now been placed in special measures, which means Sportscotland has effectively taken control until October 2023. A new Cricket Scotland board must be in place by September 2022 and consist of 40% male and 40% female, with at least 25% from an ethnic minority. Special measures are also being placed on Western District Cricket Union, which has a temporary suspension from managing their own disciplinary matters, and must complete an independent review into its governance by the end of September. This video can not be played Sharing stories of Scottish cricket racism ""incredible difficult"" for people - independent review head Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh, two Scottish cricketers who have spoken openly about being racially abused,have said they would like a public apologyfor what they went through. They told a media conference following publication of the review that they wanted to see Scottish Cricket ""improve and be equal for everyone"". Almost 1,000 people gave evidence in the inquiry commissioned following allegations, including from all-time leading wicket-taker Haq - of racism and discrimination. Mr Haq represented Scotland on more than 200 occasions but did not play again after being sent home from the 2015 World Cup. At the time he hinted he felt victimised on grounds of race. Last year formerYorkshire player Azeem Rafiq told MPsthat English cricket was ""institutionally"" racist. His testimony led to changes in Yorkshire's leadership; Headingley being temporarily stripped of hosting international matches, and the England and Wales Cricket Board putting together a 12-point plan to tackle racism in the game. A total of 68 concerns raised during the review in Scotland were referred for further inquiry, some to Police Scotland. They related to 31 allegations of racism against 15 different people, two clubs and one regional association. One incident reported to the police has already led to a person appearing in court. Ch Insp Jim McMillan, from Police Scotland's equality and diversity division, said: ""Officers have been liaising with the investigating team and will continue to engage as necessary."" Parvase Majeed, who is taking legal action over discrimination he said he experienced while umpiring for Western District Cricket Union, told BBC Scotland his experiences in cricket had had a profound impact on him. He explained: ""I'm much more conscious now of the colour of my skin and the fact that... I'm born in this country but come from an immigrant background. I think that's quite a damming statement for somebody who's spent his whole life trying to fully integrate into society."" Majid Haq won 209 caps for Scotland from 2002-15 but he felt victimised on grounds of race Plan4Sport said its ""view was clear"" that the ""governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland have been institutionally racist"". The body's director Louise Tideswell said that her team had seen bravery from ""so many people"" who had come forward to share stories that had ""clearly impacted on their lives"". She added: ""People who have loved cricket and, despite the many knockbacks, continued to try and make progress, umpires who committed so many hours even though promotion never came, and players who saw or heard racism and hostility, but kept coming back to play."" Ms Tideswell said that by failing to see problems, the leadership of the organisation""enabled a culture of racially aggravated micro-aggressions to develop"". However, she pointed out that there were ""many outstanding clubs and individuals"" delivering local programmes.. Sportscotland, which is run on Scottish government and National Lottery funding, provided more than Â£500,000 to Cricket Scotland between 2019 and 2020. Stewart Harris, chief executive of Sportscotland, said the findings were ""deeply concerning and in some cases shocking"". Campaigners Running Out Racism welcomed the report, saying it ""confirms independently the issue we've been campaigning on for some months - that the sport we love has systematic failings in the way it treats people, on the basis of race"". Speaking onGood Morning Scotland, the group's Paul Reddish said: ""At every level where the decision making happens diversity just does not exist."" He added that some of the issues in Scotland were raised before Assem Rafiq made a stand in England, and added: ""It's just that they were not listened to."" Cricket Scotland's board resigned with immediate effect on Sunday morning, ahead of the report's publication. A board statement said: ""We are all truly sorry and have apologised publicly to everyone who has experienced racism, or any other form of discrimination, in cricket in Scotland."" However, they raised concerns that plans to find a speedy resolution to the racism issues, and to modernise the governance of the sport were ""unachievable within the timetable proposed and the current governance framework"". Cricket Scotland's interim CEO Gordon Arthur issued a ""heartfelt apology"" saying the organisation vowed to implement the report recommendations in full and ""repair the sport"". He said: ""The racism and discrimination that has taken place in the sport that we all love should never have been allowed to happen, or to go unchallenged for so long."" Anas Sarwar, chairman of the Scottish Parliament's cross party group on challenging racial and religious prejudice, called the report ""devastating"". ""The victims will expect action - not words,"" he said. ""Every recommendation must be actioned and reflected across other sports and sectors."" Even before this report was commissioned, I know Sportscotland were extremely concerned about what could be happening within Scottish cricket. The publication of the review shows why they were right to fear the worst. One person close to the review told me that cricket governance in Scotland feels very much like an old boys network: Resistant to change, oblivious to obvious problems and in no way representative of most who are keen to play the sport. It's vindication for those who raised concerns but people who see this as a no more than a wake up call for cricket in Scotland may be missing the bigger picture. If, after the release of one of the most damning reports into the governance of Scottish sport, other governing bodies across Scotland aren't looking at the how they deal with racism or fail to take note of the diversity make up of their own board of directors, it's likely that someone else might be, very soon. Sir William MacPherson, who was appointed to lead the inquiry into the 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, defined institutional racism. He said it was: ""The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.""

"Rail strikes will disrupt travel as many families set off on summer holidays People are being told only to travel by train if necessary during the latest national strikes by rail workers. Some 40,000 members of the RMT union working at Network Rail and 14 train operators will walk out on Wednesday. It comes after talks over pay, jobs and terms and conditions failed following the biggest rail strikes in 30 years over three days in June. Network Rail said only 20% of services will run and some places will have no trains at all on Wednesday. For example, there will be no trains in to or out of Blackpool, Portsmouth and Bournemouth. In a bid to minimise disruption, Network Rail has published a special timetable for Wednesday, with trains set to start later and finish earlier than usual, between 07:00 and 18:30 BST. On Wednesday, the last trains from London will leave for Edinburgh at 14:00, for Birmingham at 15:43 and Manchester at 15:40. When are the next train strikes? Why haven't train strikes caused more disruption? How much are rail workers paid? RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said the union would continue to try to reach a deal with Network Rail ahead of Wednesday. ""If we could get a breakthrough then we wouldn't have to take strike action but there's a big gap between the parties at the moment,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So I'm not going to raise false hopes but we are constantly in dialogue with all of the elements of the industry."" The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We are concerned about the impact this will have on the public going about their everyday lives. ""And we will continue to call on the RMT to call off the strikes, it is in their gift to prevent this disruption."" A strike at Avanti West Coast will disrupt travel to Birmingham the day before the Commonwealth Games begin in the city All train operators, including Transport for London, will be affected by the strike as Network Rail's signallers control train movements across Great Britain. The knock-on effects of the disruption are expected to roll in to Thursday, Network Rail said. Further RMT strikes are also planned for 18 and 20 August. Wednesday's strike will disrupt travel to theWomen's Euro 2022 semi-finalin Milton Keynes and comes a day before the Commonwealth Games begin in Birmingham. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has also announced a strike by its members at Avanti West Coast, which operates some trains to Birmingham, on Wednesday. It also announced its members will strike on the 18 and 20 of August, affecting Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER and Southeastern. On Saturday, there is a separate walkout by train drivers' union Aslef at Arriva Rail London, Greater Anglia, Great Western, Hull Trains, LNER, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains. This is also the first day of the English Football League season. Wednesday's strike will disrupt travel to the Women's Euro 2022 semi-final in Milton Keynes Passengers with an advance, off-peak or anytime ticket for 27 or 30 July can travel the day before or up to and including 2 August, Network Rail said. They can also change their tickets to another date, or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled. Those with season tickets for a month or longer who choose not to travel on 27 or 30 July can claim compensation through the delay repay scheme. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said: ""Despite our best efforts to find a breakthrough, I'm afraid there will be more disruption for passengers this week as the RMT seems hell-bent on continuing their political campaigning, rather than compromising and agreeing a deal for their members."" The Department for Transport said it was ""now clearer than ever"" that the RMT has ""no interest in engaging in constructive discussions and is hell-bent on creating further misery for passengers across the UK"". ""This action is a cynically timed attempt to derail the start of the Commonwealth Games, one of the first major events the country has been able to look forward to since the pandemic,"" a statement said. ""We continue to encourage RMT to do the right thing by their members and passengers alike and call off the strikes."" How will your journey or plans be affected by the train strikes?

"Electricity pylons like this just about kept London supplied Britain paid the highest price on record for electricity in London last week as the capital narrowly avoided a power blackout, it has emerged. National Grid paid Â£9,724 per megawatt hour, more than 5,000% than the typical price, to Belgium on Wednesday to prevent south-east London losing power. Thehottest UK days on recordled to power system constraints amid high demand,as first reported by Bloomberg.,external London Fire Brigade reported its busiest day since World War Two. Hundreds of fires across the cityput strain on the city's emergency services withjust three fire engines leftat one stage. Increased demand for energy across Europe, combined with a bottleneck in the grid, forced National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) to buy electricity from Belgium at the highest price Britain has ever paid to keep power flowing. Other factors, including planned maintenance outages of overhead lines and a storm in Belgium impacting solar power, put the system under severe strain. While the amount bought at the record amount was minimal, reportedly enough to supply eight houses for a year, it has exposed the UK's reliance on importing electricity from interconnectors overseas, particularly France, Belgium and the Netherlands. A spokesperson at National Grid ESO said that while other generation was available on Wednesday, power outages during the summer period meant a specific circuit was needed to get electricity to the right place. They said: ""We were bidding in a tight market and market prices were high that day because Europe also wanted the energy.""

"The UK's Sam Ryder was pictured in a pink Kalush Orchestra hat, in a nod to this year's Ukrainian winners The UK will host the Eurovision Song Contest next year after organisers decided it could not be held in winning country Ukraine due to the ongoing war. Oleh Psiuk, the lead singer of 2022 winners Kalush Orchestra, expressed his gratitude to the UK for holding the event ""in support of our country"". The UK, which has hosted Eurovision eight times, was chosen after Sam Ryder came second in this year's contest. Several UK cities have already expressed interest in hosting. The country which wins usually stages the following year's competition. But show organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) opened talks with the BBC last month after assessing the situation following Russia's invasion. Psiuk said he was ""very sad"" that Ukraine could not host the contest but he hoped it would ""celebrate our beautiful, unique culture"". ""We, in turn, will make all efforts to help Ukraine win next year as well, so that Eurovision 2024 can take place in a peaceful country"", he added. Officials have called for the singing competition to reflect and celebrate Ukrainian culture. Which UK cities could host Eurovision 2023? Ukraine wins Eurovision, while UK comes second The UK has a number of cities with suitable arenas, accommodation and international transport links, withLondon,external,Sheffield,externalandManchester,externalalready confirming that they will put in an official bid. Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Aberdeen, Brighton, Bristol, Belfast, Cardiff and Nottingham could also throw their hats into the ring. The EBU have said the host venue should accommodate about 10,000 spectators, be within easy reach of an international airport and have enough hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators. Ukraine's win was ""deserved"" and ""encapsulated everything the song contest is about,"" said Spaceman singer Ryder. ""The main thing is that we throw an amazing event that celebrates Ukraine - and one thing's for sure, we know how to throw a party here in the UK."" The Essex singer told BBC Newsbeat he hoped the host city would be one that has believed in and supported the song contest. The bidding process to decide which city will host will begin this week. The BBC and the EBU will consider all official approaches and will publish the longlist later this summer. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra went on to play at Glastonbury last month Hosting Eurovision can be an expensive business. Azerbaijan reportedly spent Â£48 million on hosting the event in 2012. A BBC spokesperson said the singing competition is a ""a co-production of the host broadcaster and participating members of the EBU"".""There are a number of funding options to be explored that will contribute towards delivering a fantastic event and great value for licence fee payers."" Tickets usually go on sale a few months before the contest, once the specific venue is chosen. The date for the contest's Grand Final hasn't been announced yet but it usually happens in May. Ukraine will automatically qualify for the Grand Final, as is usual for the winner, along with the so-called Big Five - which includes the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. They each go straight through to the final because of their financial contributions to the event. UK in talks to host Eurovision instead of Ukraine Eurovision trophy sold to buy drones for Ukraine How the UK broke its Eurovision losing streak Eurovision win brings Ukraine 'incredible happiness' Ukraine's public broadcaster UA: PBC will work with the BBC to develop Ukrainian elements of the show. Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of UA:PBC, said: ""We are grateful to our BBC partners for showing solidarity with us."" Last month's announcement of talks with the BBC was met with disappointment by Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko, who issued a statement ""demanding to change the decision"". But on Monday, Chernotytskyi expressed gratitude to the BBC in a statement, saying: ""I am confident that together we will be able to add Ukrainian spirit to this event."" The EBU acknowledged Ukraine's initial disappointment, but said the decision was made for the ""safety and security of everyone working and participating in the event"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries both welcomed the news, while acknowledging the unwanted circumstances. Ms Dorries said she was ""delighted"", but sorry it was not possible to host the event in Ukraine, ""where it should be"". She added that the UK would ""ensure it reflects Ukraine's recent Eurovision victory and Ukrainian creativity"". Mr Johnson tweeted,externalthat the UK would put on a ""fantastic contest on behalf of our Ukrainian friends"". BBC director general Tim Davie said it was a ""great privilege"" to host the music competition, but regretful that Ukraine was not able to host.

"Lord Trimble's decision to back the Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in his political career. The then Ulster Unionist leader earned a place on the world stage, mixing with presidents and prime ministers. He and the then Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader, John Hume, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. He was Northern Ireland's inaugural first minister in an assembly that took years of bitter arguments to form. And he weathered so many challenges to his leadership and policy that commentators called him the Harry Houdini of Northern Ireland politics. Trimble and Hume were ""two men who are making history"", U2's Bono said in 1998 William David Trimble was born on 15 October 1944 in Bangor, County Down. A law lecturer at Queen's University in Belfast by profession, he entered politics through the hard-line Vanguard Party in the early 1970s. As such, he opposed the Sunningdale Agreement that had tried to broker a power-sharing agreement and create a new Northern Ireland Executive. He played an important strategic role in the loyalist strike that brought down the executive less than six months after the agreement was signed. Ironically, the Sunningdale proposals were not far removed from those he would himself campaign for 20 years later. Trimble played a major role in loyalist protests against the Sunningdale Agreement He was elected as Vanguard member for Belfast South in the short-lived Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975. But Vanguard fell apart over proposals to form closer links with the nationalist SDLP and Trimble joined the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). He held a number of positions within the UUP and finally entered Westminster as an MP after a by-election in Upper Bann in 1990. His strong unionist credentials were bolstered when he led a controversial Orange parade down the nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown, County Armagh. The march, from Drumcree Parish Church, was the scene of clashes between nationalist residents and the Orange Order in past years, and in 1995, for the first time the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) moved to prevent the march from taking place. Paisley and Trimble wrangled in the political arena but joined forces in support of the Orange Order at Drumcree After a stand-off that lasted two days, police allowed the march to go ahead as long as the Orangemen walked in silence, without the normal band music. Trimble, wearing his Orange sash, marched alongside the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley in front of hundreds of Orangemen. At the end of the road, the two men held their linked hands in the air in what was interpreted by the local community as a gesture of triumph. Trimble later protested that he had only held Paisley's hand to prevent the other man from hogging the limelight. His hard-line stand at the parade helped him in the race to become Ulster Unionist leader, when he defeated the frontrunner John Taylor. More than 70% of voters in Northern Ireland supported the Good Friday Agreement There were some who feared that his swaggering approach spelled the end for the peace process. But three years later, he and Seamus Mallon of the SDLP were appointed first and deputy first ministers in a new Northern Ireland Assembly. He became the first unionist leader since the 1920s to negotiate with Sinn FÃ©in and pushed ahead with talks in spite of the opposition of half his parliamentary party. Trimble and Hume were rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize for their work In October of the same year, Trimble and Hume were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The citation said: ""As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage when, at a critical stage of the process, he advocated solutions which led to the peace agreement."" There were stumbling blocks - Trimble often found himself locking horns with republicans over the IRA's failure to decommission its weapons. He resigned as first minister and the Northern Ireland Executive lurched from suspension to suspension. His critics said he had gone back to his hard-line roots, but he denied that. Along with Seamus Mallon (second right), Trimble rubbed shoulders with political heavyweights as he led the Northern Ireland Executive Thanks to decommissioning, he continued to share power with Sinn FÃ©in, even if that put him out of step with close colleagues. His party was deeply divided and he was under pressure. In 2001, an angry crowd greeted him and his wife Daphne in Banbridge, County Down, after the general election - he held on to his seat but by a much-reduced majority. The Democratic Unionists treated the election as a second referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, fiercely attacking the UUP and winning five seats - just one fewer than their unionist rivals. The IRA agreed to put some weapons beyond use in October 2001, and Trimble agreed to return to government, but his critics were not happy. Trimble saw off a leadership challenge from Jeffrey Donaldson, who later joined the DUP In September 2002, he and Jeffrey Donaldson came up with a compromise plan, giving the IRA a four-month deadline to give up violence for good. But just a few days later, there was news of an alleged IRA spy ring inside Stormont and the assembly collapsed again. Attempts to resurrect devolution failed. There were rows within the UUP and half of its Westminster MPs resigned the whip. But Trimble still managed to defeat Donaldson in a leadership challenge in September 2003. The DUP's David Simpson took Trimble's Westminster seat in the 2005 general election The November 2003 election saw the once-powerful UUP fall into third place behind the DUP, to which Donaldson and two other MLAs had defected. The general election of 2005 marked the end of Trimble's political career. The UUP was reduced to holding just a single seat at Westminster, where once it had held 10. Among the casualties was Trimble himself, who decided to stand down as UUP leader. He later told the BBC that he had made a mistake in not standing down in 2003, but said there had been no-one coming forward to take on the leadership. Trimble - pictured with his wife Daphne - was a Conservative peer in his later years He was made Lord Trimble of Lisnagarvey, the original name of Lisburn, his adopted home town, and joined the ranks of Conservative Party peers. There was speculation that he might have been offered a Cabinet post if the Conservatives had won the 2010 election outright. But the forming of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats meant he was not included in the government ranks. Instead, he turned his attention to the Middle East, becoming a strong advocate for Israel and a fierce critic of Hezbollah, the militant group based in Lebanon. In recent years, he was also vocal in his opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol - part of the 2019 Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Lord Trimble argued that it put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. David Trimble was married twice. His first marriage ended in divorce, and in 1978 he married Daphne Orr. The couple met when he was one of her lecturers while she was studying law at Queen's University, Belfast. Daphne Trimble stood unsuccessfully as an Ulster Conservatives and Unionists - New Force candidate for Lagan Valley in the 2010 General Election. Boating was one of the family's favourite pursuits. In later years, they owned a narrow boat that they used to explore the English canal system. The Trimbles had four children - Richard, Vicky, Nicholas and Sarah. In 2019, speaking during a House of Lords debate on same-sex marriage, Lord Trimble revealed that his daughter, Vicky, had married her girlfriend. ""I cannot change that, and I cannot now go around saying that I am opposed to it because I acquiesced to it. There we are,"" he said. His daughter said she was ""a little surprised"" by his wording but that how he deals with her and her wife speaks louder than his words. David and Daphne Trimble with a portrait by Colin Davidson unveiled at Queen's University Nicholas Trimble has followed his parents into politics. In June 2020, he was elected mayor of Lisburn and Castlereagh. In 2017, Lord Trimble wrote to the former deputy minister, Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness shortly before he died, telling him how much he appreciated his efforts to make devolution in Northern Ireland work. ""You reached out to the unionist community in a way some of them were reluctant to reach out to you,"" he wrote. ""I and my colleagues believed that you were indispensable."" In June, a portrait of Lord Trimble by artist Colin Davidson was unveiled at Queen's University. At the ceremony, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, called him a ""passionate and determined peacemaker"" and there were video messages from former US President Bill Clinton, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. David Trimble will be remembered as a street politician who won the Nobel Peace Prize; an academic who walked on an international political stage; and a man who brought the Ulster Unionists into a historic agreement for Northern Ireland.

"Ukraine won this year's contest thanks to Kalush Orchestra Cities across the UK have thrown their hats into the ring to stage next year's Eurovision Song Contest if the UK ends up taking on hosting duties. Organisers are in talks with the BBC after saying this year's winner Ukraine, which would normally stage the next event, can't because of the war. The UK has a number of cities with suitable arenas, accommodation and international transport links. Glasgow, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool have expressed an interest. However, Ukraine has called for the decision not to stage it there to be reconsidered. If the UK is chosen as the host country, cities would have to prove they have the right facilities and go through a bidding process. Eurovision organisers say the host venue should accommodate about 10,000 spectators, be within easy reach of an international airport and have enough hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators. UK in talks to host Eurovision instead of Ukraine So what are the possible locations? The song contest was staged in Turin this May Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she,externalwished Eurovision could be in Ukraine, but ""understands that in [the] circumstances this isn't possible"". ""However, I can think of a perfect venue on banks of the River Clyde!"" she added, apparently suggesting the OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow as a venue. The 14,300-capacity riverside venue is next to exhibition centres that could be useful for auxiliary facilities like the press centre. It would be fitting in some ways after the OVO Hydro was used for the exterior of the venue in Will Ferrell's 2020 Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council,wrote on Twitter,external: ""If it's to be a UK city - I can't think of anywhere better, a great music city and fittingly home to a large Ukrainian community."" Indeed, Manchester has the biggest Ukrainian population outside London, and Eurovision organisers have said it is their ""full intention that Ukraine's win will be reflected in next year's shows"". The city will have two concert arenas some time next year, when the 23,500-capacity Co-op Live arena opens, overtaking the city's existing 21,000-capacity AO Arena as the biggest indoor venue in the UK. There is also the 10,900-capacity Manchester Central. Salford in Greater Manchester became the BBC's Eurovision HQ this year, with AJ Odudu delivering the UK scores from MediaCity. Leeds had hoped to be European Capital of Culture in 2023, but Brexit prevented UK cities from entering that particular contest. Undeterred, the city is ploughing on with staging a year of culture anyway. ""Given that we will be mid-way through the Leeds 2023 year of culture, it could not come at a better time,"" a statement from Leeds City Council's leaders said. They said they had already been in touch with the government and the BBC to lobby for Eurovision to be held at the 13,781-capacity First Direct Arena. Dana International won the last time Eurovision was held in the UK, in Birmingham in 1998 This was the last place to host Eurovision in the UK, in 1998. It will have just had experienced hosting a major international event, following this summer's Commonwealth Games. It has two possible venues - the Utilita Arena and the Resorts World Arena, both with capacities of almost 16,000. A statement for Birmingham City Council said it was ""always open to exploring further opportunities to showcase Birmingham on the international stage"". It added: ""We are therefore open to working with the UK government and other stakeholders to investigate the potential for hosting the Eurovision Song Contest."" ""Why wouldn't you put it somewhere that the whole world recognises as a music city?"" asked Liverpool City Council's director of culture, Claire McColgan. She told BBC Radio Merseyside it was ""a tragic situation for Ukraine"", but said she was already thinking about ways the city could be ""putting our arms around Ukraine and and those people who are suffering absolutely terribly and doing it for them in this place"". The city's 11,000-capacity M&S Bank Arena is also next to a conference centre. Even if Scotland's first minister seems to have singled out Glasgow, six Aberdeen MPs and MSPs wasted no time insending a letter,externalto BBC director general Tim Davie saying the city is ""perfectly placed in terms of infrastructure, cultural offering and sheer enthusiasm to hold the event"". The 15,000-capacity P&J Live is ""Scotland's largest event complex"", which hosted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony in 2019, they noted. Mayor of London Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat the UK capital ""would welcome Eurovision with open arms"", adding: ""We're ready to step up and support Ukraine by hosting a contest that pays tribute to and honours the Ukrainian people, and also celebrates the very best of Britain too."" The 20,000-capacity O2 Arena and 12,500-capacity OVO Wembley Arena are no strangers to hosting major events. And London hasby far the biggest Ukrainian population in the UK,external. But the city may lose out given the parallel pushes from both the BBC and the government to move events and opportunities outside the capital. Abba after winning Eurovision 1974 in Brighton Could Eurovision return to the scene of Abba's historic 1974 victory? ""We'd love to see the event come back to the city and share some of our lucky stardust with the next global superstars,"" said Brighton and Hove City Council Leader PhÃ©lim Mac Cafferty. ""We will now approach the European Broadcasting Union and the BBC to formally express our interest."" But the Brighton Centre, with a capacity of 5,515, may not be big enough. Kevin Brennan, MP for Cardiff West, suggested smashing the Eurovision attendance record,writing on Twitter,external: ""Clearly Eurovision should be held at the Principality Stadium (roof closed) Cardiff with 70,000 partygoers - no brainer."" Or there's the Motorpoint Arena, which has a more modest 7,500 capacity. Council leader Huw Thomas agreed that it should be held in Wales - dubbed the ""land of song"" - for the first time.

"David Trimble was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland Lord Trimble, former first minister of Northern Ireland and Ulster Unionist Party leader, has died. Lord Trimble, who was 77, led the UUP between 1995 and 2005, and was instrumental in the negotiation of theGood Friday Agreement- the peace deal which ended the worst of Northern Ireland's Troubles. His efforts won him the Nobel Peace Prize along with SDLP leader John Hume. Since 2006, he sat in the House of Lords as Baron Trimble of Lisnagarvey. He was the first person to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive established as part of the Good Friday Agreement. A statement from the UUP said: ""It is with great sadness that the family of Lord Trimble announce that he passed away peacefully earlier today following a short illness."" He is survived by his wife, Daphne and their four children. Obituary: Lord Trimble What is the Good Friday Agreement? Tributes paid to 'man of courage and wisdom' Lord Trimble Lord Trimble: Life in pictures Current UUP leader Doug Beattie described Lord Trimble as a ""political giant"". ""David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland,"" Mr Beattie said. ""He will forever be associated with the leadership he demonstrated in the negotiations that led up to the 1998 Belfast Agreement. ""The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster. Â Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lord Trimble as ""a giant of British and international politics"". ""[He] will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better,"" Mr Johnson added. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said Lord Trimble played ""a crucial and courageous role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described him as ""one of the most consequential political leaders of the last century"". He added that without the former UUP leader's political bravery, the Good Friday Agreement would never have been signed. Lord Trimble was a hard-line political unionist leader who compromised at a critical time to cement peace in Northern Ireland. And it came at a great cost, not just a personal cost and the abuse that he received at the time, but also a great cost to his party. In the years after the Good Friday Agreement, the UUP lost its position as the top unionist party in Northern Ireland to the DUP. But there's no doubt about it, Lord Trimble got great international acclaim for the steps that he had taken, the bravery that he showed in negotiating a deal that others said was not going to be possible within a unionist leader. Of course he won the Nobel Peace Prize along with John Hume for his efforts. David Trimble often found himself facing down political adversaries And in later years, Lord Trimble became the great defender of the Good Friday Agreement in the House of Lords. In recent times, he talked about Brexit and of course his concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, and how he felt it undermined everything that he had achieved through the Good Friday Agreement. It was only a few weeks ago that Lord Trimble last made his public appearance at the unveiling of his portrait in Queen's University. On that occasion, he said the portrait was there for others on which to deliver their verdict. Many people now will be delivering their verdict on Lord Trimble, and his lasting legacy of peace in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Lord Trimble's courage in helping negotiate the agreement ""leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the former first minister ""made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom"" and was a ""committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland"". Sir Jeffrey's disagreements with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement led to him quitting the UUP in 2003 and defecting to the DUP. ""Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Lord Trimble's political journey took him from a young hardliner in the 1970s to a unionist leader who compromised to help deliver an executive and assembly at Stormont where unionism and nationalism shared power. He received much praise, including the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr Hume, for helping to bring to an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume died in August 2020, a few months afterSeamus Mallon of the SDLP, who served as deputy first ministerwhen Lord Trimble was first minister. Bertie Ahern said Lord Trimble was a good negotiator Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who led the Irish government at the Good Friday Agreement negotiations in 1998, said Lord Trimble was courageous and that although they had ""many a row, many arguments"", they were able to laugh about that in later years. ""As a good negotiator, when he made a deal, when he settled something, he stuck by it,"" Mr Ahern told broadcaster RTÃ. ""He stuck by it subsequently and he paid a price, he lost his seat in Upper Bann, he got a lot of criticism from his wider unionist family. ""He was a good guy and he stood firmly by what he believed in and I had a long chat with him just a few weeks ago in Queen's [University] and he knew what was coming, he was brave in that, as he was in everything else."" Gerry Adams, the Sinn FÃ©in leader at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said that although he and Lord Trimble had fundamentally different opinions, he always believed the UUP leader was committed to the peace process. ""David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated,"" Mr Adams said. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair - who headed the British side at the time of the 1998 peace talks - said Lord Trimble, ""in his support of the peace process, showed politics at its very best"". ""When some within his own ranks were opposed to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, he supported it,"" he said. ""When we needed his willingness to go the extra mile for peace, he travelled that mile. When there was the prospect of collapse of the process without strong leadership, he provided that leadership. ""His contribution to Northern Ireland and to the United Kingdom was immense, unforgettable and frankly irreplaceable."" His predecessor, Sir John Major, said: ""When David Trimble became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, he made a critical contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. ""He shed his former opposition to the process, and became an innovative advocate for a peaceful settlement. ""This was a brave and principled change of policy, and critical to the creation of peace in Northern Ireland. ""He thoroughly merits an honourable place amongst peacemakers."" U2 frontman Bono endorsed Lord Trimble and John Hume's calls for peace ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement But Lord Trimble came in for sustained criticism from others within political unionism for signing up to the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the DUP. He was criticised for agreeing a deal which allowed Sinn FÃ©in - the political wing of the IRA - to enter into the devolved government while the IRA had not decommissioned its weapons. In 2005, he lost his House of Commons seat to a DUP challenger and went on to enter the House of Lords where he sat as a Conservative Party peer. Lord Trimble is survived by his wife Daphne (left) and their four children Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the Good Friday Agreement was Lord Trimble's greatest legacy. ""His contribution to the peace process and the ending of violence in our society helped secure his place in history,"" she said. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer described him as a ""towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said that while he fundamentally disagreed with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement, he was a ""foremost thinker within unionism"".

"A Ryanair boss has criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they had ""had one job to do to"". Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"". His comments come as staff shortages at airports have led to major disruption and cancellations in recent months. Airports said they had been recruiting security staff since late last year. A spokesperson for the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh, said: ""The vast majority of passengers across the UK are now getting away on their holidays with no or minimal disruption."" The spokesperson added that it was ""essential"" the industry worked together to fill the remaining vacancies, including for airline ground handling staff. Mr Sorahan, who said Ryanair was having a ""phenomenal"" summer as the airline posted profits of â¬170m (Â£145m) for the three months to the end of June, told the BBC's Today programme the ""biggest issue"" the company had faced was ""air traffic control disruptions all across Europe"". ""You have to hold ANSPs [air navigation service providers] and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up appropriately for that,"" he said. ""Equally the airports themselves, they had one job to do to and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and security staff. They had the schedules months in advance. ""We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their planning better next year."" Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled?

After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with resurgent demand. Airlines have been blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage, while airports have also been criticised for not being able to cater for more flights. Meanwhile, aviation industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic. The industry has also been threatened by strike action, with many staff demanding pay rises to cope with the rising cost of living. Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic, but said it had agreed deals with more than 80% of its pilots and about 70% of cabin crews. ""We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future,"" the group said. Mr Sorahan told the BBC that any strike action that had taken place had a ""minimal impact"" on services. Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and EasyJet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary previously told the BBC that the company's ""strong balance sheet"" going into the pandemic enabled it to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of Covidso they were able to ramp up operations when restrictions were lifted. There have been delays and long queues at airports in the last few months Mr Sorahan said Ryanair was ""fully staffed"" and operating more than 3,000 flights a day as many people venture on their first summer holiday since pandemic restrictions were lifted. Ryanair said it remained ""confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families"". The airline said its passenger numbers had rebounded to 45.5 million - 9% higher than before the Covid pandemic - but its first quarter profits were still short of pre-Covid levels. The company said its fuel costs had soared by 560% to â¬1bn and added the Ukraine war had ""badly damaged"" Easter bookings and fares. Mr O'Leary said in a statement on the company's results that unpredictability around fuel prices, the risk of new Covid variants and the war in Ukraine meant the company was unable to forecast a profit for the full financial year. ""While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in autumn 2022. Our experience... shows how fragile the travel market remains,"" he said. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up?

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The final two in the race to become prime minister are facing big challenges when it comes to the economy. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss need to set out how they plan to conquer inflation, avoid recession and help the public through a record fall in disposable income. I'm highlighting here three questions every member of the public will want an answer to as they hit the campaign trail. Their response will be considered by a far smaller group of people: Conservative Party members and the way they vote will also define which way the party is set to turn. Is it still a party about a small state, low taxes and the free market? Or has the big spending of the Covid era, coupled with promises of extra money for the NHS and talk of ""taking back control"", changed what it stands for? And what will that mean for the fundamental issues everybody is facing? Billions of pounds of support is already being given out to households, especially low income ones. But, since that help was announced, it's become clear bills will rise even further than originally expected,perhaps to over Â£3,300 a yearfor an average household. Some backbench MPs say households simply can't afford to pay bills at those levels, and are calling for more direct intervention to stop bills rising. Some are even suggesting breaking the link between bills and wholesale electricity and gas prices altogether. This would mean the government or suppliers paying for sudden cost rises and recouping the cost from customers over a longer period. Ultimately, the pandemic may have raised expectations about what role government should take in a crisis. But so far neither candidate has indicated they plan to do anything very radical. Rishi Sunak has not indicated any further help on bills beyond the existing support schemes he announced when chancellor. However, Liz Truss has said that she would reduce the ""green levies"" - these are the extra charges added to bills to help finance the switch to renewables. That could save bill-payers Â£153 a year. But the levies also help fund schemes to support poorer customers paying their energy bills, money that still needs to come from somewhere. And the crisis over energy could get even worse of course, if President Putin cuts off gas supplies to Europe. In that situation, could either of the candidates contemplate telling the public to ration energy use? For a few months last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's key message was that Britain deserved a pay rise. ""Wage growth"" would be the key measure of the success of his ""levelling up"" mission, he said. But very soon after, Mr Sunak's former department, the Treasury, clarified that wage rises would have to be justified by an increase in productivity. Both candidates for prime minister seem concerned that if wage settlements go above 5% that could prompt a spiral of rising wages and prices, locking in high inflation for years. And a recent round of public sector pay settlements pitched pay rises for nurses and the police at an average of around 4-5%, although lower paid staff are set for higher rises. While it is true that this is the largest cash rise in wages in two decades, as the government says, it is also true - as the unions point out - that it is one of the largest ever real cuts in wages ever seen. With inflation heading above 10%, any annual wage settlements below that represent a real-terms cut, a shrinkage of the value of what people are taking home at the end of the month. So public sector workers could see their take home pay shrink sharply in value under either of the candidates. Private sector pay settlements could of course be higher. And all pay packets would benefit from a policy advocated by the Truss campaign: to reverse April's National Insurance rise of 1.25%. Mr Sunak has played down the prospect of personal tax cuts before autumn 2023 if he becomes prime minister, warning that early reductions would risk exacerbating the rise in the cost of living. State pensions are due to go up by 10% in April as a result of the restoration of the ""triple lock"" policy, which guarantees the recent surge in inflation is reflected in pensioners' incomes. This will kick in, even if inflation has fallen back by then. Mr Sunak has spoken in favour of the rise, arguing that, unlike higher wages for public sector workers, it won't add to inflation. The government's official forecasters have pointed to the long term cost of this policy, as well as increasing spending on health and social care, but the candidates may well both stick to this policy of generosity towards the generation that's now in retirement. On the other hand they could cut back on the considerable tax breaks high earners currently enjoy when saving for their old age. That would raise billions for the exchequer. Or they could decide to raise the age at which the state pension is paid out. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that previous rise to 66 years effectively doubled pensioner poverty among 65 year olds. In this contest, what matters is how the candidates go down with around 160,000 Conservative Party members. But many of the promises made will set the course on the economy at a tricky time, affecting tens of millions more.

"""Is he the guy from Friends?,"" one voter asks while looking at a photo of one of the candidates vying to be the country's next prime minister. As Stoke-on-Trent prepares to host a debate for the Tory leadership, you could say neither Rishi Sunak nor Liz Truss are really cutting through. Not for the first time, the city is proving a key political battleground for the Conservative Party. Whoever takes over needs to be retaining former red wall seats like these. The two candidates willappear live on BBC One laterto be put through their paces by Sophie Raworth in front of a live studio audience. Stoke-on-Trent is a key political battleground after flipping from Labour to the Conservatives in 2019 The constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent North and Central are areas which flipped from Labour to Conservative in 2019. An important question for Ms Truss and Mr Sunak is how can they capitalise on the party's popularity under Boris Johnson in areas like this - is it through policy or personality? If the latter, they could be in trouble. In Hanley, the heart of Jo Gideon's Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency, people I stopped to speak to had trouble naming the final two from photographs. When shown Mr Sunak, answers included: ""Is he the guy from Friends?"" Few managed to name Liz Truss but guessed she worked in politics. Sophie Gardener had concerns over both candidates' records over Covid-19 Shopping in Hanley town centre, Sophie Gardener recognises the photograph of Mr Sunak but pointing at Ms Truss, she says she's not sure who she is. She knows Rishi Sunak was in charge of the country's finances and added: ""It worries me slightly the fact that both have been involved with the Covid lead up and neither have been entirely successful. ""But it is what it is and somebody has to win."" If their personalities aren't winning them over, can the candidates do it with policies? How would they help people living here? Stoke-on-Trent has high levels of deprivation and locals are keen to hear more about government plans for levelling up This was a Brexit voting area: In the 2016 referendum 69% who cast their vote did so to leave the European Union. Boris Johnson pledged to ""get Brexit done"" and for many in Stoke-on-Trent, he was a man of his word. But there is a bigger discussion now - levelling up. Mr Johnson called it the ""defining mission"" of his government and the aim was to give people and communities that feel they have been left behind a chance to catch up. Stoke-on-Trent received Â£56m to redevelop the area, with plans including building a 3,600-seat arena, 285 new homes and a three-star hotel. However, there has been little mention of what was a key theme of the Conservatives' 2019 election campaign from the two leadership contenders. Thomas Jameson says he wants both candidates to see what the city is like By the city's bus station, Thomas Jameson said he was pleased the two politicians would debate here. ""They can see what the city's like and how we live,"" he said. ""They can see what working life is like for people with the cost of living crisisâ¦ some people have to go to food banks."" Chris Mason: High stakes for Sunak and Truss before first debate Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Stoke-on-Trent has become a symbol of struggling Britain. It is characterised by high levels of deprivation where people queue for food banks and communities come together to help each other manage as cost of living pressures increase. The Indices of Multiple Deprivation for 2019 ranks the city as the 13th most deprived local authority area out of 317 in England. And the percentage of children living in poverty is about 24% - higher than the national average of 16%. Alex Banks says he agrees with levelling up and wants to see a strong community in Stoke-on-Trent Alex Banks said although he was not a Conservative voter, he broadly agreed with the principles of levelling up. ""I have a general sense of what levelling up means, strengthen the economy, strengthen the people,"" said the Staffordshire University student. ""Levelling up can mean many different things to many different people, so it's about levelling up in the right wayâ¦ building a strong community in Stoke-on-Trent and building infrastructure that helps."" Local politicians are also worried about the rising costs of inflation and the impact that has on the economic growth of the area and residents. The city's Conservative council leader Abi Brown has written to government to ask how levelling up will continue as financial pressures increase. Conservative votes are needed in ""red wall, left behind and in need of levelling up"" areas like Stoke-on-Trent, she said. ""To stay in No 10, places like ours matter.""

"Parents Hollie Dance (pictured) and Paul Battersbee lost two High Court hearings to get continued life support treatment for their son Archie The parents of a 12-year-old boy have lost an appeal against a decision to allow life support treatment to end. Archie Battersbee was found unconscious at home in Southend, Essex, on 7 April and the Royal London Hospital believe he is brain dead. Appeal judges supported a High Court ruling that ending his life support was lawful and in his best interests. A 48-hour delay to ending treatment has been ordered so the family can appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. In a statement, his mother Hollie Dance, said: ""As long as Archie is alive, I will never give up on him; he is too good to give up on. ""We should not have to endlessly battle the hospital in the courts for what we believe is right for Archie. ""Top judges have told us, however, that this is the law. If this so, the law must change."" She added the family was considering taking the case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. Archie has not regained consciousness since he was found by his mother Ms Dance, who believes he had been taking part in an online challenge. Paul Battersbee (pictured at an earlier court hearing) was taken ill before today's Court of Appeal ruling Court of Appeal judges in London were asked to postpone their ruling as Archie's father, Paul Battersbee, had been taken ill outside court, but they refused. It is thought Mr Battersbee may have suffered a heart attack or stroke prior to the hearing. However, judges said it was in Archie's best interests to give a judgement today. Ms Dance said she thought judges had been ""insensitive"" in deciding not to adjourn. She also wanted appeal judges to adjourn their ruling on the basis that she had ""video evidence"" that indicated that Archie, who is attached to a ventilator, had twice tried to breathe for himself on Friday and Saturday. ""The hospital seem to cherry pick what they want to put over to the court. Again we've heard today that Archie's losing weight. He put on 0.4 kilos yesterday. How is that losing weight?"" said Ms Dance. The family's legal team indicated they would make a separate application to Mr Justice Hayden, who made the latest High Court judgement, on that point. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel in east London, had taken the case to the courts to get a ruling on what was in the best interests of Archie, who the courts have heard had catastrophic brain injuries. Judges in two separate High Court hearings had previously ruled against his parents, who wanted treatment to continue while his heart was still beating. Court rules Archie Battersbee life-support can end How did Archie Battersbee's case end up in court? Court of Appeal to hear Archie Battersbee case Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Peter Jackson have now refused to overturn thelast High Court judgement by Mr Justice Hayden. It means life support treatment can lawfully end. Sir Andrew said medical staff had seen ""no signs of life"" in Archie and his ""every bodily function is now maintained by artificial means"".

"Traffic queuing at the Port of Dover at the weekend People hoping to cross the Channel to France this weekend are being warned it will be very busy again, after three days of queues and delays. And that pattern could continue with drivers warned by the AA they could face a summer of repeat delays. Vehicles flowed freely on Monday after a weekend that saw miles of tailbacks build up in Kent. Kent Resilience Forum's Toby Howe said it was a ""very vulnerable situation"" and it took little to cause congestion. Queues of lorries began to build at Dover in the morning, although the port said traffic was flowing normally. Ferry operator DFDS said there were ""small queues"" and asked passengers to allow at least 90 minutes to get through border controls, while P&O ferries said the roads leading to the port were clear. Delays finally easing for Eurotunnel travellers Gridlock persists for thousands travelling to France Do you want to be aBBC Travel Watcher? Get in touch. Over the weekend, traffic built up on the roads leading to the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone and Port of Dover after the M20 motorway through Kent to the south coast was closed to cars from Maidstone to Folkestone because of Operation Brock, which sees lorries diverted to park on the motorway. With the motorway shut, car drivers were diverted to smaller roads which then got jammed with miles of tailbacks. Some people reported sleeping overnight in their cars, while one tired family said the last three miles of their journey took 21 hours. Mr Howe said things were back to ""business as normal"" but remained ""on a knife edge"" with not much needed to create congestion. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the coming weekend was expected to be the second busiest getaway weekend of the summer holidays and, with traffic crossing the Channel back to pre-pandemic levels and additional checks at the border since the UK left the European Union, it took ""very little to cause those tailbacks"". He said on Friday the Port of Dover had issues with a lack of resources, which was compounded by a crash on the motorway. ""You only need another crash on the road or maybe a train breakdown or a power failure somewhere for it to then become a big problem."" Mr Howe said there needed to be more infrastructure in place to take traffic off the roads, such as lorry parks. ""We shouldn't really have to have queues of traffic due to all of this, so we need more infrastructure in place,"" he said. Lorries and cars queuing on the M20 near Folkestone on Friday The AA's head of roads policy Jack Cousens said it had been an ""incredible weekend of traffic jams"" but warned the group was concerned ""we could be in for a repeat of this congestion across the summer"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Getlink - which operates the Eurotunnel between Folkestone and Calais, said the issue over the weekend had been caused by the expected ""very heavy traffic of passengers"" getting away on holidays alongside an unexpected amount of truck traffic, which would normally have crossed to France earlier but had been delayed by an accident on the motorway. He said there were several factors that could help ease the situation, including bringing in digital technology to speed up border checks, increasing the resilience of the road network - with two of the UK's biggest ports served by the same motorway - and improving the Channel tunnel railway network. Mr Keefe added: ""There are definitely solutions. These solutions are not new. They've been on the table for many, many years. ""But hopefully something like this will actually focus attention."" The Dover delays led to a war of words between French and UK officials, with both sides blaming the other. The UK government said French authorities failed to provide enough border staff to check passports at Dover over the weekend, while the French transport minister Clement Beaune highlighted additional border checks brought on by Brexit. Downing Street has insisted the issues were not caused by Brexit, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman saying they were down to a combination of factors ""including a shortage of French border control staff"". He said the government understood the post-Brexit changes required and had planned for it, adding: ""We think we have operational procedures and processes in place that do not need to see these levels of queues."" However, travel journalist Simon Calder said we were seeing the impact of leaving the EU for the first time during peak summer travel season as passenger numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels. Whereas in the past passport control had been able to wave travellers through with a flash of their passport at their discretion during busy times, he said, now they had to check and stamp every passport. Mr Calder said on average it was taking about a minute and a half for them to process a family of four. Over the weekend the Port of Dover said it handled almost 142,000 passengers. National Highways re-opened the coastbound M20 between junctions 9 and 11 in Kent shortly after 01:00 BST on Monday, but it remains closed to non-freight traffic between junctions 8 and 9 as part of Operation Brock. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the ""entire discreditable episode"" highlighted the need to make Kent's roads as resilient as possible. She called for more investment in border systems and upgrades to the A2 and lorry parks. Are you planning on travelling via Dover this weekend? Do you have concerns about delays?

"Parents Hollie Dance (pictured) and Paul Battersbee lost two High Court hearings to get continued life support treatment for their son Archie The parents of a 12-year-old boy have lost an appeal against a decision to allow life support treatment to end. Archie Battersbee was found unconscious at home in Southend, Essex, on 7 April and the Royal London Hospital believe he is brain dead. Appeal judges supported a High Court ruling that ending his life support was lawful and in his best interests. A 48-hour delay to ending treatment has been ordered so the family can appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. In a statement, his mother Hollie Dance, said: ""As long as Archie is alive, I will never give up on him; he is too good to give up on. ""We should not have to endlessly battle the hospital in the courts for what we believe is right for Archie. ""Top judges have told us, however, that this is the law. If this so, the law must change."" She added the family was considering taking the case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. Archie has not regained consciousness since he was found by his mother Ms Dance, who believes he had been taking part in an online challenge. Paul Battersbee (pictured at an earlier court hearing) was taken ill before today's Court of Appeal ruling Court of Appeal judges in London were asked to postpone their ruling as Archie's father, Paul Battersbee, had been taken ill outside court, but they refused. It is thought Mr Battersbee may have suffered a heart attack or stroke prior to the hearing. However, judges said it was in Archie's best interests to give a judgement today. Ms Dance said she thought judges had been ""insensitive"" in deciding not to adjourn. She also wanted appeal judges to adjourn their ruling on the basis that she had ""video evidence"" that indicated that Archie, who is attached to a ventilator, had twice tried to breathe for himself on Friday and Saturday. ""The hospital seem to cherry pick what they want to put over to the court. Again we've heard today that Archie's losing weight. He put on 0.4 kilos yesterday. How is that losing weight?"" said Ms Dance. The family's legal team indicated they would make a separate application to Mr Justice Hayden, who made the latest High Court judgement, on that point. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel in east London, had taken the case to the courts to get a ruling on what was in the best interests of Archie, who the courts have heard had catastrophic brain injuries. Judges in two separate High Court hearings had previously ruled against his parents, who wanted treatment to continue while his heart was still beating. Court rules Archie Battersbee life-support can end How did Archie Battersbee's case end up in court? Court of Appeal to hear Archie Battersbee case Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Peter Jackson have now refused to overturn thelast High Court judgement by Mr Justice Hayden. It means life support treatment can lawfully end. Sir Andrew said medical staff had seen ""no signs of life"" in Archie and his ""every bodily function is now maintained by artificial means"". He said the case had received widespread media coverage - including a photograph of Archie. ""Archie is no longer the boy in the photograph,"" said Sir Andrew. In June, a first High Court judge agreed with doctors that Archie Battersbee was ""brain-stem dead"" Mr Justice Hayden delivered his ruling after reviewing evidence in the Family Division of the High Court in London. He described what had happened to Archie as a ""tragedy of immeasurable dimensions"", but said medical evidence was ""compelling and unanimous"" and painted a ""bleak"" picture. Archie's parents, who are separated, had argued he made errors and had been appealing for a third hearing at the High Court with a different judge. Barrister Edward Devereux QC, leading the legal team for Archie's parents, had told appeal judges that Mr Justice Hayden had not given ""real or proper weight"" to Archie's previously expressed wishes and religious beliefs. He also appealed on the grounds that Archie's family's wishes were also not given ""real or proper weight"", that Mr Justice Hayden had failed to carry out a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the benefits and burdens of continuing life support treatment, and had that he had been wrong to conclude that treatment was burdensome and futile.

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Leeds United's home kit is not available to buy until late August Fewer than half of English Football and Premier League clubs have both their new home and away kits available to buy online ahead of the season, as manufacturers face supply chain issues. Only 44 out of 92 clubs currently have both their 2022-23 season kits on sale. Premier League clubs including Crystal Palace and Leeds United are among those who have neither kit available. Some have blamed the delays on disruption and factory shutdowns in Asia due to Covid. It means some clubs won't have their new kit on sale before the season starts, which for the Championship is 29 July, for League One and League Two is 30 July and for the Premier League is 5 August. Out of the 92 clubs in the top four leagues: 44 teams have both kits available for sale on their website 22 teams have only their home kit available 7 teams have only their away kit available 19 teams have neither kit available One English Football League chief executive, who did not want to be named, told the BBC his club had signed off kit designs in October, with orders placed shortly afterwards, but neither their new home or away kit were available to sell yet due to Covid disruption at factories in Asia. He said it was difficult to quantify the cost to the club until it saw the impact on sales, but added that some clubs would face a financial hit. ""We can manage our cash flow, but it will impact on some clubs' cash flow, I'm sure, because July is a month when there's not much cash coming into the business,"" he said. ""We're in a position where that hasn't caused any disasters for us. But for some clubs I would imagine it's pretty difficult."" 'People put such value on these bits of polyester' Warning shipping delay problems set to continue He added that the delay would also be disappointing for fans. ""If you're a parent or a grandparent who's going to buy a kit for a young child's birthday in July, which you would normally have done, you've not been able to do that, you've got to wait,"" he said. Sandy Domingos-Shipley often goes to games with her husband and children, who are big Leeds United supporters Sandy Domingos-Shipley has three children, aged 15, 13 and eight, who are all Leeds United supporters. Normally she would buy them the new kit as soon as it was released before the start of the season but this year she hasn't been able to, with the club saying it won't be on sale until late August. Although Sandy said she would still be buying the kit when it was available, she added: ""The season will be four weeks in and for the kids it kind of ruined the moment because it became our own tradition. ""It makes no sense because that's when you know that you're gonna get lots of people to buy."" Manufacturer Adidas said: ""Like many other industries, we continue to be confronted with limited port and transport capacities. ""We understand the frustration felt by the fans at this time and we have worked in close collaboration with our club partners to find the best solution on delivering the product as soon we can."" Leeds United did not respond to a request for comment. Leeds United and Crystal Palace wore their new kits for a pre-season friendly - but their home and away kits are not available for fans to buy yet Kieran Maguire, a senior lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, said some clubs were being affected by the impact of Covid in Asia, where many factories are based, with production limited due to restrictions. He said a shortage of container ships and disruption at ports was also contributing to the issue. However, he told the BBC the financial impact on most elite clubs would be limited as they are generally paid a fixed amount by manufacturers for the season, with only around 7% commission per unit sold. ""I think fans are fairly sanguine in relation to this,"" he said, adding that fans who wanted the kit would still buy it when it was available. Mr Maguire added that the other peak market for clubs was Christmas and the issue should be resolved by then. He said smaller clubs were more likely to be affected, as manufacturers would prioritise bigger clubs who sell more shirts. Stockport County does not currently have its away shirts for the new season for sale on its website Others have faced different issues. On Friday,Stockport County said,externalit had been ""significantly let down"" by its kit provider Puma. ""It has recently come to light that their shipping partner has mislaid part of the shipment due to be delivered, and as a result we are unable to fulfil a number of orders placed by fans whilst they try to locate it,"" the club said in a statement.

"Parents Hollie Dance (pictured) and Paul Battersbee lost two High Court hearings to get continued life support treatment for their son Archie The parents of a 12-year-old boy have lost an appeal against a decision to allow life support treatment to end. Archie Battersbee was found unconscious at home in Southend, Essex, on 7 April and the Royal London Hospital believe he is brain dead. Appeal judges supported a High Court ruling that ending his life support was lawful and in his best interests. A 48-hour delay to ending treatment has been ordered so the family can appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. In a statement, his mother Hollie Dance, said: ""As long as Archie is alive, I will never give up on him; he is too good to give up on. ""We should not have to endlessly battle the hospital in the courts for what we believe is right for Archie. ""Top judges have told us, however, that this is the law. If this so, the law must change."" She added the family was considering taking the case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. Archie has not regained consciousness since he was found by his mother Ms Dance, who believes he had been taking part in an online challenge. Paul Battersbee (pictured at an earlier court hearing) was taken ill before today's Court of Appeal ruling Court of Appeal judges in London were asked to postpone their ruling as Archie's father, Paul Battersbee, had been taken ill outside court, but they refused. It is thought Mr Battersbee may have suffered a heart attack or stroke prior to the hearing. However, judges said it was in Archie's best interests to give a judgement today. Ms Dance said she thought judges had been ""insensitive"" in deciding not to adjourn. She also wanted appeal judges to adjourn their ruling on the basis that she had ""video evidence"" that indicated that Archie, who is attached to a ventilator, had twice tried to breathe for himself on Friday and Saturday. ""The hospital seem to cherry pick what they want to put over to the court. Again we've heard today that Archie's losing weight. He put on 0.4 kilos yesterday. How is that losing weight?"" said Ms Dance. The family's legal team indicated they would make a separate application to Mr Justice Hayden, who made the latest High Court judgement, on that point. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel in east London, had taken the case to the courts to get a ruling on what was in the best interests of Archie, who the courts have heard had catastrophic brain injuries. Judges in two separate High Court hearings had previously ruled against his parents, who wanted treatment to continue while his heart was still beating. Court rules Archie Battersbee life-support can end How did Archie Battersbee's case end up in court? Court of Appeal to hear Archie Battersbee case Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Peter Jackson have now refused to overturn thelast High Court judgement by Mr Justice Hayden. It means life support treatment can lawfully end. Sir Andrew said medical staff had seen ""no signs of life"" in Archie and his ""every bodily function is now maintained by artificial means"". He said the case had received widespread media coverage - including a photograph of Archie. ""Archie is no longer the boy in the photograph,"" said Sir Andrew. In June, a first High Court judge agreed with doctors that Archie Battersbee was ""brain-stem dead"" Mr Justice Hayden delivered his ruling after reviewing evidence in the Family Division of the High Court in London. He described what had happened to Archie as a ""tragedy of immeasurable dimensions"", but said medical evidence was ""compelling and unanimous"" and painted a ""bleak"" picture. Archie's parents, who are separated, had argued he made errors and had been appealing for a third hearing at the High Court with a different judge. Barrister Edward Devereux QC, leading the legal team for Archie's parents, had told appeal judges that Mr Justice Hayden had not given ""real or proper weight"" to Archie's previously expressed wishes and religious beliefs. He also appealed on the grounds that Archie's family's wishes were also not given ""real or proper weight"", that Mr Justice Hayden had failed to carry out a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the benefits and burdens of continuing life support treatment, and had that he had been wrong to conclude that treatment was burdensome and futile. Archie's parents have been supported by a campaign organisation called the Christian Legal Centre. All arguments were dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

"This video can not be played Lenny Woodard's son accidentally discovered his dad has dementia A former rugby international fears he won't recognise his children in five years because of early onset dementia. Lenny Woodard believes rugby caused his dementia. On Monday he,ex-captain Ryan Jonesand 180 others intend to issue formal proceedings against World Rugby, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and the Rugby Football Union (RFU). World Rugby, the WRU and RFU said they could not comment on any case as no legal proceedings had been received. However, in a joint statement, they said they cared deeply about all players and had strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries. London-based law firm Rylands Legal is representing the claimants, arguing rugby's governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect players from permanent injury caused by ""repetitive concussive and sub-concussive blows"". Amateur rugby player's grieving family warn of risk Ben Kay and Shane Williams join head injury research 'No doubt Dad's dementia was caused by rugby' The firm said it was the biggest class action of its kind outside the United States, where the NFL has paid more than Â£664m to date to former players who developed dementia or concussion-related problems. ""This claim isn't just about financial compensation,"" Rylands said in a statement. ""It is also about making the game safer and ensuring current and former players get tested so that if they are suffering a brain injury they can get the clinical help they need."" Lenny Woodward said he had his first concussion from rugby when he was 11 Former dual-code pro Mr Woodard played rugby union for Pontypool, Ebbw Vale and Pontypridd, and although not capped for Wales he played on their 1998 tour to South Africa and won five caps for the Wales rugby league team. He said others have not yet spoken about their condition as they cannot face telling their families. The dad-of-five said he first suffered a concussion aged 11. The 45-year-old said: ""The stark reality of being diagnosed with early onset dementia in your 40s, with young children, means in five years, 10 years, 15 years time we might not know who they are."" He recounted discussing the matter with his partner as his children played in the next room. Ryan Jones, who said he lived liked a superhero for 15 years, is also among those intending to issue formal proceedings He said: ""My partner was explaining, 'I want the kids to see you as much as possible, as often as possible and do as many memorable things as possible because there is a chance in 10 years, 15 years time you're not even going to know who they are.' His nine-year-old son, Leo, overheard the conversation. ""He burst into tears, ran into the room, hugged me and would not let go of me for a few minutes,"" he said. Pontypridd-born Mr Woodard, who was diagnosed last year, said he was aware of others in the game in a similar situation to himself. He said: ""The reason they haven't gone public with it is because they're struggling to tell their children, wives, family."" When speaking to other players he has assured them they are not alone. And he warned: ""There's going to be more."" On Monday 180 former rugby players, including Adam Hughes, are to begin proceedings against the rugby authorities It was hard to tell people who had played at the sport's top level what lay ahead. ""Unfortunately the game is going to take away their enjoyment of their later life,"" he said. Mr Woodard said he had gone from having ""perfect"" recollection to regularly repeating himself. ""My memory, my thought processes, are declining gradually and I can see that,"" he said. ""I was diagnosed a year ago and I can see it has got worse over the last year. ""I'm hoping to slow that acceleration as much as possible. I often forget journeys at crucial stages within it, repeat myself in conversations, repeat myself half-an-hour later, an hour later, forget conversations, things I've done in the past completely now. ""Whereas five years, 10 years ago I had what I would class as a perfect recollection of things."" Also part of the legal action is former Dragons and Wales under-20s player, Adam Hughes. Rugby 'should follow NFL' over contact in training Gabby Logan's heart screening call for brother A ""complete culture change"" was needed in rugby, the 32-year-old said. Adam Hughes said he knew of pros and ams who believed they had brain damage symptoms but played on Mr Hughes added that he knew of professionals and amateurs who believed they had symptoms of brain damage but were still playing. ""Some people don't want to believe it, they don't want to know that they've got issues, because that scares them, other people would rather not know they've got it because they want to continue playing,"" he said. Both Mr Woodard and Mr Hughes want the minimum rest period for concussed players to be extended to 3-4 weeks. Now a financial advice company boss, Mr Hughes said current players needed other employment options, so they don't have to keep playing. He said: ""Unfortunately rugby is the only thing they can do at this present time."" Progressive Rugby, a non-profit group demanding better protection for players, is not involved in the court action, but said it was in the process of ""finalising a comprehensive list of player welfare critical requirements"" to submit to World Rugby. ""We believe delay is no longer an option and that radical action must be taken as a matter of urgency to ensure rugby union's reputation isn't damaged beyond repair,"" they said. Lawyers representing the ex-players say the rugby authorities: Failed to take proper steps to pay attention to player safety and brain health, when the game became professional Did not do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage Neglected to cut contact in training Should have reduced the number of matches played Cut concussed players rest time instead of extending it Declined to get or follow advice on permanent brain injury risk Ignored evidence concussions may not be immediately apparent and carried out inadequate assessments during games Omitted to make rules limiting substitutionswhich could make players smaller Former Wales international, Alix Popham, wasdiagnosed with early onset dementiain 2020 at the age of 40. The Newport-born flanker, who had 33 caps for Wales, started to forget people's names, or lose track of a conversation. ""I went on a bike ride, it's a loop I've done from my house over a hundred times, got lost, and came back pretty shook up,"" he said. His doctor believes he had more than 100,000 sub-concussions in his career. Alix Popham (right) had a 14-year professional career ""Sub-concussive hits are the silent killer where every contact not necessarily to the head is causing some sort of damage to the brain,"" he said. ""With rugby, your body's hit all the time and your head will fly back, which then causes damage to the brain."" His doctor has set up a 10-year management plan, getting him to do regular tests and brain training. ""After that, who knows,"" he said. ""I've got three daughters, Holly who's 18, Isabel 14 and Darcy who's just turned four so trying to be here as me for as long as possible is the plan."" Looking back, Popham said he would still have played rugby but would have rested more after being concussed. ""Every day when we were doing contact sessions and we were seeing stars and had to have sniffing salts or spray water in your face to come round,"" he recalled. ""They were traumatic brain injuries causing damage and I needed the correct rest to give my brain that time to heal. ""That's what current players are still not doing,"" he said, saying when he speaks to those players, ""nobody is sticking to those current guidelines."" In a joint statement issued to the BBC World Rugby, RFU and WRU said: ""We care deeply about all our players, including former players, and never stand still when it comes to welfare. ""Our strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries are driven by a passion to safeguard our players and founded on the latest science, evidence and independent expert guidance.""

"The Farne Islands are home to 200,000 seabirds including guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills, shags, Arctic terns and puffins Thousands of seabirds have died in an outbreak of avian flu on the Farne Islands in the worst ""disaster"" to hit the colonies in nearly 100 years. The National Trust, which cares for the islands, has found more than 3,000 dead birds but estimated ten times more may have fallen into the sea. The islands off the Northumberland coast are home to about 200,000 birds. The charity wants an urgent response but the government said it could only take ""limited effective actions"". People are advised not to touch any dead birds The Farnes are an internationally important habitat for 23 species including puffins, Arctic terns, guillemots, razorbills, sandwich terns and common terns. They wereclosed to the publicearlier this month to try and prevent the spread of bird flu. Some of the dead birds found were ringed, which revealed details of their travel logged with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). Casualties include an Arctic tern which had flown from the Farne Islands to Antarctica eight times during its lifetime, covering a distance of 144,000 miles (231,745km). Also discovered was a 16-year-old kittiwake which was ringed on the islands in 2006, and a four-year-old kittiwake which may have returned to breed on the islands for the first time having spent most of its life on the North Atlantic. Rangers believe many more birds will have died whose bodies have been lost to the sea Farne Islands general manager Simon Lee said: ""The National Trust has cared for the Farne Islands for just under 100 years, and there are no records of anything so potentially damaging to our already endangered seabird colonies."" Teams of rangers who live and work on the islands have been removing the birds so they can be incinerated. They have been wearing full PPE to collect the carcasses and avoid further contamination to healthy birds. Further south along the Northumberland coast, RSPB rangers on Coquet Island have been collecting andburying thousands of dead seabirdsafter bird flu was confirmed there, devastating the main breeding season. The disease was confirmed in June at agannet colony at Bass Rock, the world's largest colony of northern gannets, and a number of dead birds were found washed up along theNorthumberland and Teessidecoasts. Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: ""The scale of this disaster calls for an urgent national response plan for the virus in wild birds. ""We need a more coordinated approach to ensure effective monitoring, surveillance and reporting to support research into the impacts this deadly disease is having on our wild birds across the UK. ""There is a lack of clear and effective guidance and arrangements for disease control, and we need to urgently develop mitigation measures to reduce the further spread in the coming months as birds migrate back into UK waters."" The National Trust said it would work with conservational partners including the RSPB and BTO to help. National Trust rangers have been removing their carcasses to prevent further contamination The Department for Environment and Rural Affairs said: ""We recognise the significant threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to the UK's precious wild bird populations, but there are limited effective actions that can be taken to protect them, as opposed to captive bird flocks. ""Our current policy is in line with international standards of best practice for disease control. The Animal and Plant Health Agency operates a robust, year-round programme of dead wild bird surveillance and clear public guidance has been issued not to handle their carcasses. ""Our new research consortium also funds research into how bird flu viruses are emerging in wild populations and help us understand the risk posed to both domestic and wild birds."" The UK Health Security Agency has advised that the risk to the public is very low, but people should not touch sick or dead birds and keep any animals away.

"This video can not be played Lenny Woodard's son accidentally discovered his dad has dementia A former rugby international fears he won't recognise his children in five years because of early onset dementia. Lenny Woodard believes rugby caused his dementia. On Monday he,ex-captain Ryan Jonesand 180 others intend to issue formal proceedings against World Rugby, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and the Rugby Football Union (RFU). World Rugby, the WRU and RFU said they could not comment on any case as no legal proceedings had been received. However, in a joint statement, they said they cared deeply about all players and had strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries. London-based law firm Rylands Legal is representing the claimants, arguing rugby's governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect players from permanent injury caused by ""repetitive concussive and sub-concussive blows"". Amateur rugby player's grieving family warn of risk Ben Kay and Shane Williams join head injury research 'No doubt Dad's dementia was caused by rugby' The firm said it was the biggest class action of its kind outside the United States, where the NFL has paid more than Â£664m to date to former players who developed dementia or concussion-related problems. ""This claim isn't just about financial compensation,"" Rylands said in a statement. ""It is also about making the game safer and ensuring current and former players get tested so that if they are suffering a brain injury they can get the clinical help they need."" Lenny Woodward said he had his first concussion from rugby when he was 11 Former dual-code pro Mr Woodard played rugby union for Pontypool, Ebbw Vale and Pontypridd, and although not capped for Wales he played on their 1998 tour to South Africa and won five caps for the Wales rugby league team. He said others have not yet spoken about their condition as they cannot face telling their families. The dad-of-five said he first suffered a concussion aged 11. The 45-year-old said: ""The stark reality of being diagnosed with early onset dementia in your 40s, with young children, means in five years, 10 years, 15 years time we might not know who they are."" He recounted discussing the matter with his partner as his children played in the next room. Ryan Jones, who said he lived liked a superhero for 15 years, is also among those intending to issue formal proceedings He said: ""My partner was explaining, 'I want the kids to see you as much as possible, as often as possible and do as many memorable things as possible because there is a chance in 10 years, 15 years time you're not even going to know who they are.' His nine-year-old son, Leo, overheard the conversation. ""He burst into tears, ran into the room, hugged me and would not let go of me for a few minutes,"" he said. Pontypridd-born Mr Woodard, who was diagnosed last year, said he was aware of others in the game in a similar situation to himself. He said: ""The reason they haven't gone public with it is because they're struggling to tell their children, wives, family."" When speaking to other players he has assured them they are not alone. And he warned: ""There's going to be more."" On Monday 180 former rugby players, including Adam Hughes, are to begin proceedings against the rugby authorities It was hard to tell people who had played at the sport's top level what lay ahead. ""Unfortunately the game is going to take away their enjoyment of their later life,"" he said. Mr Woodard said he had gone from having ""perfect"" recollection to regularly repeating himself. ""My memory, my thought processes, are declining gradually and I can see that,"" he said. ""I was diagnosed a year ago and I can see it has got worse over the last year. ""I'm hoping to slow that acceleration as much as possible. I often forget journeys at crucial stages within it, repeat myself in conversations, repeat myself half-an-hour later, an hour later, forget conversations, things I've done in the past completely now. ""Whereas five years, 10 years ago I had what I would class as a perfect recollection of things."" Also part of the legal action is former Dragons and Wales under-20s player, Adam Hughes. Rugby 'should follow NFL' over contact in training Gabby Logan's heart screening call for brother A ""complete culture change"" was needed in rugby, the 32-year-old said. Adam Hughes said he knew of pros and ams who believed they had brain damage symptoms but played on Mr Hughes added that he knew of professionals and amateurs who believed they had symptoms of brain damage but were still playing. ""Some people don't want to believe it, they don't want to know that they've got issues, because that scares them, other people would rather not know they've got it because they want to continue playing,"" he said. Both Mr Woodard and Mr Hughes want the minimum rest period for concussed players to be extended to 3-4 weeks. Now a financial advice company boss, Mr Hughes said current players needed other employment options, so they don't have to keep playing. He said: ""Unfortunately rugby is the only thing they can do at this present time."" Progressive Rugby, a non-profit group demanding better protection for players, is not involved in the court action, but said it was in the process of ""finalising a comprehensive list of player welfare critical requirements"" to submit to World Rugby. ""We believe delay is no longer an option and that radical action must be taken as a matter of urgency to ensure rugby union's reputation isn't damaged beyond repair,"" they said. Lawyers representing the ex-players say the rugby authorities: Failed to take proper steps to pay attention to player safety and brain health, when the game became professional Did not do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage Neglected to cut contact in training Should have reduced the number of matches played Cut concussed players rest time instead of extending it Declined to get or follow advice on permanent brain injury risk Ignored evidence concussions may not be immediately apparent and carried out inadequate assessments during games Omitted to make rules limiting substitutionswhich could make players smaller Former Wales international, Alix Popham, wasdiagnosed with early onset dementiain 2020 at the age of 40. The Newport-born flanker, who had 33 caps for Wales, started to forget people's names, or lose track of a conversation. ""I went on a bike ride, it's a loop I've done from my house over a hundred times, got lost, and came back pretty shook up,"" he said. His doctor believes he had more than 100,000 sub-concussions in his career. Alix Popham (right) had a 14-year professional career ""Sub-concussive hits are the silent killer where every contact not necessarily to the head is causing some sort of damage to the brain,"" he said. ""With rugby, your body's hit all the time and your head will fly back, which then causes damage to the brain."" His doctor has set up a 10-year management plan, getting him to do regular tests and brain training. ""After that, who knows,"" he said. ""I've got three daughters, Holly who's 18, Isabel 14 and Darcy who's just turned four so trying to be here as me for as long as possible is the plan."" Looking back, Popham said he would still have played rugby but would have rested more after being concussed. ""Every day when we were doing contact sessions and we were seeing stars and had to have sniffing salts or spray water in your face to come round,"" he recalled. ""They were traumatic brain injuries causing damage and I needed the correct rest to give my brain that time to heal. ""That's what current players are still not doing,"" he said, saying when he speaks to those players, ""nobody is sticking to those current guidelines."" In a joint statement issued to the BBC World Rugby, RFU and WRU said: ""We care deeply about all our players, including former players, and never stand still when it comes to welfare. ""Our strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries are driven by a passion to safeguard our players and founded on the latest science, evidence and independent expert guidance."" At home with the Pophams as dementia battle goes on World Cup winner Thompson was 'on suicide watch' The player with 100,000 sub-concussions 'Rugby must settle with players who are suing or risk its future' Premier League to trial saliva test Rugby 'should follow NFL' over contact in training Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""  Liz Truss has also tweeted her support for TalkTV host Kate McCann, after the presenter fainted while hosting the leadership debate. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques.

"Traffic queuing at the Port of Dover at the weekend People hoping to cross the Channel to France this weekend are being warned it will be very busy again, after three days of queues and delays. And that pattern could continue with drivers warned by the AA they could face a summer of repeat delays. Vehicles flowed freely on Monday after a weekend that saw miles of tailbacks build up in Kent. Kent Resilience Forum's Toby Howe said it was a ""very vulnerable situation"" and it took little to cause congestion. Queues of lorries began to build at Dover in the morning, although the port said traffic was flowing normally. Ferry operator DFDS said there were ""small queues"" and asked passengers to allow at least 90 minutes to get through border controls, while P&O ferries said the roads leading to the port were clear. Delays finally easing for Eurotunnel travellers Gridlock persists for thousands travelling to France Do you want to be aBBC Travel Watcher? Get in touch. Over the weekend, traffic built up on the roads leading to the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone and Port of Dover after the M20 motorway through Kent to the south coast was closed to cars from Maidstone to Folkestone because of Operation Brock, which sees lorries diverted to park on the motorway. With the motorway shut, car drivers were diverted to smaller roads which then got jammed with miles of tailbacks. Some people reported sleeping overnight in their cars, while one tired family said the last three miles of their journey took 21 hours. Mr Howe said things were back to ""business as normal"" but remained ""on a knife edge"" with not much needed to create congestion. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the coming weekend was expected to be the second busiest getaway weekend of the summer holidays and, with traffic crossing the Channel back to pre-pandemic levels and additional checks at the border since the UK left the European Union, it took ""very little to cause those tailbacks"". He said on Friday the Port of Dover had issues with a lack of resources, which was compounded by a crash on the motorway. ""You only need another crash on the road or maybe a train breakdown or a power failure somewhere for it to then become a big problem."" Mr Howe said there needed to be more infrastructure in place to take traffic off the roads, such as lorry parks. ""We shouldn't really have to have queues of traffic due to all of this, so we need more infrastructure in place,"" he said. Lorries and cars queuing on the M20 near Folkestone on Friday The AA's head of roads policy Jack Cousens said it had been an ""incredible weekend of traffic jams"" but warned the group was concerned ""we could be in for a repeat of this congestion across the summer"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Getlink - which operates the Eurotunnel between Folkestone and Calais, said the issue over the weekend had been caused by the expected ""very heavy traffic of passengers"" getting away on holidays alongside an unexpected amount of truck traffic, which would normally have crossed to France earlier but had been delayed by an accident on the motorway. He said there were several factors that could help ease the situation, including bringing in digital technology to speed up border checks, increasing the resilience of the road network - with two of the UK's biggest ports served by the same motorway - and improving the Channel tunnel railway network. Mr Keefe added: ""There are definitely solutions. These solutions are not new. They've been on the table for many, many years. ""But hopefully something like this will actually focus attention."" The Dover delays led to a war of words between French and UK officials, with both sides blaming the other. The UK government said French authorities failed to provide enough border staff to check passports at Dover over the weekend, while the French transport minister Clement Beaune highlighted additional border checks brought on by Brexit. Downing Street has insisted the issues were not caused by Brexit, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman saying they were down to a combination of factors ""including a shortage of French border control staff"". He said the government understood the post-Brexit changes required and had planned for it, adding: ""We think we have operational procedures and processes in place that do not need to see these levels of queues."" However, travel journalist Simon Calder said we were seeing the impact of leaving the EU for the first time during peak summer travel season as passenger numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels. Whereas in the past passport control had been able to wave travellers through with a flash of their passport at their discretion during busy times, he said, now they had to check and stamp every passport. Mr Calder said on average it was taking about a minute and a half for them to process a family of four. Over the weekend the Port of Dover said it handled almost 142,000 passengers. National Highways re-opened the coastbound M20 between junctions 9 and 11 in Kent shortly after 01:00 BST on Monday, but it remains closed to non-freight traffic between junctions 8 and 9 as part of Operation Brock. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the ""entire discreditable episode"" highlighted the need to make Kent's roads as resilient as possible. She called for more investment in border systems and upgrades to the A2 and lorry parks. Are you planning on travelling via Dover this weekend? Do you have concerns about delays?

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We need three things: growth, growth, growth"". Sir Keir Starmer has promised Labour would make delivering ""strong, secure and fair"" growth its main priority if it won power. In a speech, the Labour leader attacked the Tories for creating a ""brittle"" economy succeeding in ""too few places"". He announced his party would set up a new advisory body to help boost long-term growth. It comes as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss trade blows over the economy in the Conservative leadership race. In his speech in Liverpool, Sir Keir criticised the ""Thatcherite cosplay"" on display in the contest and accused the Conservatives of ""clinging to the old ideas"". Both Tory leadership candidates have ruled out calling a snap election if they enter Downing Street. The next election has to take place by January 2025 at the latest. Truss says Tory economic policy choked off growth What are the leadership candidates promising? In his speech, Sir Keir said ""growth, growth and growth"" was required to generate revenue for public services and make workers feel ""fairly rewarded"". Taking a swipe at the Tory leadership hopefuls, he said former chancellor Mr Sunak was ""the architect of the cost-of-living crisis,"" and Foreign Secretary Ms Truss was ""the latest graduate from the school of magic money tree economics"". As part of his party's economic strategy, he said Labour would not ""announce a single penny of day-to-day spending without saying how we would pay for it,"" and would ""invest to meet the challenges of the future"". Sir Keir said his party would set up an Industrial Strategy Council to set out ""strategic national priorities that go beyond the political cycle"". He added that the council's role would be established in law, drawing on the expertise of business, science, and unions, providing advice to politicians and holding them to account. He also said it was possible to see economic growth while achieving the UK's target to hit net-zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere would be balanced by the amount removed. ""We will not be distracted by the siren calls - from the right or the left - that say economic growth and net-zero do not go together,"" Sir Keir pledged. He promised he would ""challenge my party's instincts"", with a focus ""as much about growth and productivity, as we have done in the past about redistribution and investment"". But Sir Keir has been challenged from the left of his party, with some calling on him to fight the next election on platform of renationalising public utilities. Writing in the Guardian,external, former shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the renationalisation policies in the party's 2019 manifesto were popular and it the party needs to stay ""on the side of public opinion here"". Pressed on whether he would renationalise energy and water firms, Sir Keir said he would take a ""pragmatic"" not ""ideological approach"". Sir Keir Starmer's speech made clear that the re-nationalisation of industries should no longer be considered a priority, or even a policy, for Labour. He's talked recently about a ""clean slate"" after the party's 2019 manifesto which proposed to take water, energy and broadband industries into public ownership. When running for leader, Sir Keir pledged to support ""common ownership"" but recently said he was ""not in favour of nationalisation"". The view now from the top of the party is that re-nationalisation would not provide the economic growth the UK needs and investment in public services is a greater priority. Sir Keir - who today admitted this approach would challenge his party's instincts - faces his own challenge to convince those in his party who see his as the wrong approach. Meanwhile, the economy has become a key battleground in the Tory leadership race, with Mr Sunak describing Ms Truss's plan to borrow money to fund immediate tax cuts as a ""fairytale"". But Ms Truss criticised tax increases introduced by her former cabinet colleague Mr Sunak, arguing they ""choked off"" growth. She said the economic policies of previous Conservative and Labour governments over the past 20 years have not delivered growth. Both candidates have suggested their proposals would be approved of by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The pair will go head-to-head in a live TV debate later -Our Next Prime Minister will be broadcast on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Monday.

"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

"This video can not be played Lenny Woodard's son accidentally discovered his dad has dementia A former rugby international fears he won't recognise his children in five years because of early onset dementia. Lenny Woodard believes rugby caused his dementia. On Monday he,ex-captain Ryan Jonesand 180 others intend to issue formal proceedings against World Rugby, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and the Rugby Football Union (RFU). World Rugby, the WRU and RFU said they could not comment on any case as no legal proceedings had been received. However, in a joint statement, they said they cared deeply about all players and had strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries. London-based law firm Rylands Legal is representing the claimants, arguing rugby's governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect players from permanent injury caused by ""repetitive concussive and sub-concussive blows"". Amateur rugby player's grieving family warn of risk Ben Kay and Shane Williams join head injury research 'No doubt Dad's dementia was caused by rugby' The firm said it was the biggest class action of its kind outside the United States, where the NFL has paid more than Â£664m to date to former players who developed dementia or concussion-related problems. ""This claim isn't just about financial compensation,"" Rylands said in a statement. ""It is also about making the game safer and ensuring current and former players get tested so that if they are suffering a brain injury they can get the clinical help they need."" Lenny Woodward said he had his first concussion from rugby when he was 11 Former dual-code pro Mr Woodard played rugby union for Pontypool, Ebbw Vale and Pontypridd, and although not capped for Wales he played on their 1998 tour to South Africa and won five caps for the Wales rugby league team. He said others have not yet spoken about their condition as they cannot face telling their families. The dad-of-five said he first suffered a concussion aged 11. The 45-year-old said: ""The stark reality of being diagnosed with early onset dementia in your 40s, with young children, means in five years, 10 years, 15 years time we might not know who they are."" He recounted discussing the matter with his partner as his children played in the next room. Ryan Jones, who said he lived liked a superhero for 15 years, is also among those intending to issue formal proceedings He said: ""My partner was explaining, 'I want the kids to see you as much as possible, as often as possible and do as many memorable things as possible because there is a chance in 10 years, 15 years time you're not even going to know who they are.' His nine-year-old son, Leo, overheard the conversation. ""He burst into tears, ran into the room, hugged me and would not let go of me for a few minutes,"" he said. Pontypridd-born Mr Woodard, who was diagnosed last year, said he was aware of others in the game in a similar situation to himself. He said: ""The reason they haven't gone public with it is because they're struggling to tell their children, wives, family."" When speaking to other players he has assured them they are not alone. And he warned: ""There's going to be more."" On Monday 180 former rugby players, including Adam Hughes, are to begin proceedings against the rugby authorities It was hard to tell people who had played at the sport's top level what lay ahead. ""Unfortunately the game is going to take away their enjoyment of their later life,"" he said. Mr Woodard said he had gone from having ""perfect"" recollection to regularly repeating himself. ""My memory, my thought processes, are declining gradually and I can see that,"" he said. ""I was diagnosed a year ago and I can see it has got worse over the last year. ""I'm hoping to slow that acceleration as much as possible. I often forget journeys at crucial stages within it, repeat myself in conversations, repeat myself half-an-hour later, an hour later, forget conversations, things I've done in the past completely now. ""Whereas five years, 10 years ago I had what I would class as a perfect recollection of things."" Also part of the legal action is former Dragons and Wales under-20s player, Adam Hughes. Rugby 'should follow NFL' over contact in training Gabby Logan's heart screening call for brother A ""complete culture change"" was needed in rugby, the 32-year-old said. Adam Hughes said he knew of pros and ams who believed they had brain damage symptoms but played on Mr Hughes added that he knew of professionals and amateurs who believed they had symptoms of brain damage but were still playing. ""Some people don't want to believe it, they don't want to know that they've got issues, because that scares them, other people would rather not know they've got it because they want to continue playing,"" he said. Both Mr Woodard and Mr Hughes want the minimum rest period for concussed players to be extended to 3-4 weeks. Now a financial advice company boss, Mr Hughes said current players needed other employment options, so they don't have to keep playing. He said: ""Unfortunately rugby is the only thing they can do at this present time."" Progressive Rugby, a non-profit group demanding better protection for players, is not involved in the court action, but said it was in the process of ""finalising a comprehensive list of player welfare critical requirements"" to submit to World Rugby. ""We believe delay is no longer an option and that radical action must be taken as a matter of urgency to ensure rugby union's reputation isn't damaged beyond repair,"" they said. Lawyers representing the ex-players say the rugby authorities: Failed to take proper steps to pay attention to player safety and brain health, when the game became professional Did not do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage Neglected to cut contact in training Should have reduced the number of matches played Cut concussed players rest time instead of extending it Declined to get or follow advice on permanent brain injury risk Ignored evidence concussions may not be immediately apparent and carried out inadequate assessments during games Omitted to make rules limiting substitutionswhich could make players smaller Former Wales international, Alix Popham, wasdiagnosed with early onset dementiain 2020 at the age of 40. The Newport-born flanker, who had 33 caps for Wales, started to forget people's names, or lose track of a conversation. ""I went on a bike ride, it's a loop I've done from my house over a hundred times, got lost, and came back pretty shook up,"" he said. His doctor believes he had more than 100,000 sub-concussions in his career. Alix Popham (right) had a 14-year professional career ""Sub-concussive hits are the silent killer where every contact not necessarily to the head is causing some sort of damage to the brain,"" he said. ""With rugby, your body's hit all the time and your head will fly back, which then causes damage to the brain."" His doctor has set up a 10-year management plan, getting him to do regular tests and brain training. ""After that, who knows,"" he said. ""I've got three daughters, Holly who's 18, Isabel 14 and Darcy who's just turned four so trying to be here as me for as long as possible is the plan."" Looking back, Popham said he would still have played rugby but would have rested more after being concussed. ""Every day when we were doing contact sessions and we were seeing stars and had to have sniffing salts or spray water in your face to come round,"" he recalled. ""They were traumatic brain injuries causing damage and I needed the correct rest to give my brain that time to heal. ""That's what current players are still not doing,"" he said, saying when he speaks to those players, ""nobody is sticking to those current guidelines."" In a joint statement issued to the BBC World Rugby, RFU and WRU said: ""We care deeply about all our players, including former players, and never stand still when it comes to welfare. ""Our strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries are driven by a passion to safeguard our players and founded on the latest science, evidence and independent expert guidance.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Grass fires break out in Surrey and London Firefighters are to stay overnight to monitor the aftermath of a large grass fire at a Surrey beauty spot. At least eight hectares of land were affected by the blaze that started around midday at Hankley Common near Farnham on Sunday. A major incident was declared and although that has now ended, people are still being warned to avoid the area. There were separate blazes in Rammey Marsh, Enfield, at Cranford Park, Hayes, and at Burgate in Suffolk. In Surrey, people reported seeing smoke over Guildford, Woking and Addlestone and on the M25 near Chertsey. Firefighters were called just after midday and the fire service has said it expects crews to remain at the scene until at least Monday. The cause of the blaze is unknown. People are being asked to call 999 only if they see fire but not to report smoke. Surrey Policetweeted,externalthat it was assisting fire crews and had closed Thursley Road. The force asked people to stay away while emergency teams have dealt with the incident. Smoke from Hankley Common could be seen for miles around People were warned about the dangers of a ""great deal of smoke"" Flying instructor Jordan Bridge said the blaze was one of the largest he has seen in the area. The 24-year-old, from Alton in Hampshire, said at about lunchtime he saw ""huge smoke clouds building to the east of Lasham Airfield"" where he works. ""After take-off I could see that the fire was covering a wide area with the smoke extending downwind over Guildford and Woking towards London,"" he added. ""Obviously [I was] concerned for all involved in the local area given the already stretched resources of local fire services."" The extent of the blaze on Hankley Common can be seen from this angle Crews tackled a blaze on the same stretch of land on Wednesday whenfour hectares of Hankley Common near Elstead caught fire. After that incident, the service warned that despite overnight rain, more warm weather was expected and vegetation remained extremely dry, urging the public not to use barbeques and to take care. Hankley Common - known for its appearance in the Bond film Skyfall - is a heathland habitat and home to ground-nesting birds including nightjars and skylarks. It is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is used for training exercises. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Burgate, Suffolk, 18 fire engines were sent to deal with a stubbled crop fire. Crews were first called at 12:40 to reports of thick black smoke and the fire service initially said ""the wind is not helping, the fire has been spreading"". That blaze has been contained but crews are still trying to put it out. Crews were first called to Burgate at 12:40 to reports of thick black smoke ""Farmers are ploughing firebreaks ahead of the flames,"" one witness said.
