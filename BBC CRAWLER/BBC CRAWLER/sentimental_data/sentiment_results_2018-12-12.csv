"Government guidance says services should develop evacuation plans The second phase of the Grenfell Tower inquiry is unlikely to start until the end of 2019, the chairman has said. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said there were some 200,000 documents still to disclose which would not be done before next autumn, more than two years after the fire which killed 72 people. The first phase, which concludes this week, centred on the night of the fire - the second will examine wider issues. Earlier, the inquiry heard the fire service had no tower evacuation plans. The Fire Brigades Union said Britain's fire services had no strategy for evacuating a high-rise building at the time of the Grenfell disaster. This was despitegovernment guidelines,externalwhich recommended contingency plans in case services needed to abandon the standard ""stay put"" advice. On the night of the fire at the tower block in North Kensington, west London, a policy of ""stay put"" was kept in place for around two hours after the blaze broke out. Both firefighters on the ground and in control rooms told residents they should remain in their flats. Governmentguidance published in 2014 says fire services should develop evacuation plans,externalfor when the standard ""stay put"" advice becomes ""untenable"". Sir Martin, the retired appeal court judge who is chairing the inquiry, will consider whether evacuating the building earlier could have saved lives. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Martin Seaward, the FBU's barrister, told the inquiry that developing practical drills for an evacuation plan would have been ""a major undertaking achievable only at the national level"". It would be ""too daunting"" even for a large fire service like London's, he said. Firefighters have previously given evidence that evacuations in such circumstances were not something they were trained to do. ""The incident commander was placed in an impossible position without an evacuation procedure in place,"" Mr Seaward said. He added that he hoped the inquiry would next consider why evacuation plans hadn't been developed. Before the Grenfell fire there had been a series of well-known smaller fires which spread rapidly, Mr Seaward told the inquiry. But he said procedures and training were not drawn up as a result. On Monday, a lawyer for the victimstold the inquirythat London Fire Brigade's leaders had let down residents and firefighters. The first phase of the inquiry's hearings - which ended on Wednesday - concentrated solely on the events of the night of 14 June 2017. The second phase will examine the refurbishment of the tower and concerns expressed by residents about fire safety. Sir Martin said that ""if all goes well"" the second half of the inquiry would take place closer to the tower in west London, after survivors and the bereaved struggled to get to the current central London venue. He said work had begun to digest 200,000 documents relating to the refurbishment, including the installation of cladding and insulation, which would ""tell much of the story"" of what went wrong.

"A streamer, a dense part of the corona, moves away from the Sun (out of view to the left) Just weeks after making the closest ever flyby of the Sun, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe is sending back its data. Included in the observations is this remarkable image of the energetic gas, or plasma, flowing out from the star. The bright dot is actually Mercury. The black dots are repeats of the little world that occur simply because of the way the picture is constructed. Parker's WISPR instrument acquired the vista just 27.2 million km from the surface of the Sun on 8 November. The imager was looking out sideways from behind the probe's thick heat shield. Bye bye snow: Why winter is shrinking Space laser makes height maps of Earth Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Artwork: Parker must always keep its heatshield pointed at the Sun The Nasa mission was launched back in August to study the mysteries of the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona. This region is strangely hotter than the star's ""surface"", or photosphere. While this can be 6,000 degrees Celsius, the outer atmosphere may reach temperatures of a few million degrees. The mechanisms that produce this super-heating are not fully understood. Parker aims to solve the puzzle by passing through the outer atmosphere and directly sampling its particle, magnetic and electric fields. ""We need to go into this region to be able to sample the new plasma, the newly formed material, to be able to see what processes, what physics, is taking place in there,"" explained Nicola Fox, director of the Heliophysics Division at Nasa HQ in Washington DC. ""We want to understand why there is this temperature inversion, as in - you walk away from a hot star and the atmosphere gets hotter not colder as you would expect."" Not only is Parker breaking records for proximity to the Sun, it is also setting new speed records for a spacecraft. On the recent flyby, it achieved 375,000km/h. The fastest any previous probe managed was about 250,000km/h. Parker will go quicker still on future close passes of the Sun.. The latestscience from the mission is being featured here at the American Geophysical Union,externalFall Meeting - the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists.

"Evelyn Berezin said her word processor would help secretaries become more efficient at their jobs The woman who created and sold what many recognise as the world's first word processor has died aged 93. Evelyn Berezin called the device the Data Secretary when, in 1971, her company Redactron launched the product. She grew Redactron from nine employees to close to 500 and was named one of the US's top leaders by BusinessWeek magazine in the year she sold it, 1976. She had earlier built one of the original computerised airline reservation systems. The innovation - which matched customers and available seats - was tested by United Airlines in 1962. According to the Computer History Museum, it had a one-second response time and worked for 11 yearswithout any central system failures,external. The technology vied with the rival Sabre system, developed by American Airlines, for being the first of its kind. In addition, Ms Berezin helped pioneer other types of special-purpose computing including: an automated banking system a weapons-targeting calculator for the US Defense Department terminals for a horse-racing track that monitored how much money was being bet on each animal In an interview in 2015,external, Ms Berezin explained that she had decided to set up her own business in the mid-60s after coming to the conclusion that her prospects were limited so long as she was employed by someone else. She said that she had initially considered developing an electronic cash register but ultimately opted to create what would become known as a word processor instead. She said: ""6% of all the people in the United States who worked were secretaries. ""At the time we started, which was in 1968 to 1969, nobody really had any desk-type computers on which you could write a word-processing program that a secretary would use. ""I know that desktop computers seem obvious now but it wasn't so then."" At the time, the nearest equivalent was a machineby IBM called the MT/ST,external- a typewriter with magnetic tape recording and playback facilities. IBM's marketing referred to a ""word processor"", but the machine relied on relay switches rather than computer chips, had been targeted at military equipment makers rather than the wider business market, and in Ms Berezin's mind was ""klutzy"". ""We were committed to building a computer to run our system and we knew that we had to use integrated circuits because it was the only way we could make it small enough and cheap enough and reliable enough to sell,"" Ms Berezin said. Her machine - which stood about 1m (3ft 3in) tall - featured a keyboard, cassette drives, control electronics and a printer. It could record and play back what the user had typed, allowing it to be edited or reprinted. The original model lacked a monitor, and soon faced competition from a rival, the Lexitron, which did. But later versions of the Data Secretary did include a screen. Some versions of the Data Secretary did feature a screen The project nearly ended in disaster. Ms Berezin had intended to buy the processors required from Intel, which had gone into business in 1968. But it said it was too busy dealing with orders for its memory chips. The solution was that Redactron had to design some of the chips required itself and provide the schematics to two manufacturers. There were further problems with a prototype when it was put on display in a New York hotel for reporters to see. The issue was that in dry weather, it was prone to a build-up of static electricity, which caused sparks to fly between its circuits, preventing it from working. ""To our horror it was a dry day and the engineers were setting this non-working machine up for our big story,""Ms Berezin said,external. ""Ed Wolf [our head of engineering brought] a full pail of water and without a word to anyone throws the pail of water over the whole thick carpet in the room. ""The water sank into the carpet, which stayed damp for three or four hours, and the machine worked perfectly."" The first production machine was delivered to a customer in September 1971. And over the following year, Redactron sold or rented more than 770 others, excluding demo units. Over the following years, demand grew but the company's finances came under strain, in part because of high interest rates and a recession that meant clients wanted to rent rather than buy its products. ""We were told by the bank to sell the company and they had somebody they knew who was interested,"" said Ms Berezin. ""At the time, I was distraught about it."" She went to work for the purchaser, the business equipment-maker Burroughs Corporation. But it proved to be an ill match. ""I was not one of them -  I told them what I thought - a loud woman they did not know how to deal with,"" she said. ""So, they disconnected and so did I."" Ms Berezin left the company around 1980, after which she became involved in venture capital and sat on other companies' boards before becoming involved with Stony Brook University. The New York Timesreported that a nephew had confirmed she had died on 8 December,externalin Manhattan after turning down treatment for cancer. One of the remaining Data Secretary word processors can be seen on display at the Computer History Museum in California.

"The 29-year-old man was said to have been physically exhausted when he was rescued A man has been rescued after spending two days trapped in a grease vent at a vacant Chinese restaurant in California, police say. Emergency crews responded to reports of ""a faint voice calling for help"" from the building in the San Francisco area. The man was said to have been exhausted and suffering from dehydration, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Police say he may have been trespassing, but it is unclear whether the incident was a burglary attempt.

"Young's best-known songs include Cinnamon Girl, Rockin' In The Free World and Heart of Gold Neil Young says he'll go ahead with a show in London's Hyde Park next year - but it will no longer be part of the Barclaycard-sponsored BST festival. The star had previously criticised BST organisers for choosing a ""fossil fuel funding entity"" as a sponsor. ""That doesn't work for me,"" he said in a subsequently-deleted website post. ""I believe in science. I worry about the climate crisis and am deeply concerned about its massive global ramifications."" Although he stopped short of cancelling the shows, he said ""one option"" would be to replace the sponsor. On Tuesday, he appeared to claim victory in aseparate post,external, saying he was ""happy to announce that the Hyde park show will proceed without Barclays as a sponsor"". ""We are overjoyed, so happy to be playing the show!"" Later in the day, BST organisers said in a statement: ""Neil Young has made the decision to move away from the Barclaycard presents British Summer Time concert series. ""Neil Young and Bob Dylan will play a stand-alone concert in Hyde Park on the same date, 12 July. All tickets will remain valid."" Barclaycard told the BBC it would not comment on the situation. Other BST gigs, including dates by Robbie Williams and Florence + The Machine, will not be affected. Barclays was listed as a major funder of fossil fuel extraction in a2018 report,externalby the non-profit group Banking on Climate Change, receiving a ""D+"" rating. Earlier this year, the bank's AGM wasdisrupted by protestors,externalcritical of its funding for oil pipelines from Canadian tar sands. Barclaycard, a division of Barclays that provides credit card and payment services, has sponsored the BST Hyde Park concerts since their inception in 2013, with headline acts including The Rolling Stones, Taylor Swift and Tom Petty. Young also played the festival in 2014 with his band Crazy Horse, apparently without objection to the bank's involvement. On Sunday, the star aired a number of grievances about his upcoming concert, claiming it was announced prematurely, and objecting to the fact that tickets were put on sale to the public ahead of his fans. ""I had no idea the announcement was coming that day,"" he wrote. ""I was still finessing the art for the poster and trying to make sure that all of the details of the show were agreeable to me. ""Then, suddenly, someone jumped the gun. The tickets were put on sale and the announcement was made, all without my knowledge."" The post included lyrics from Young's 1988 anti-corporate sponsorship song This Note's For You: ""I ain't singing for Pepsi / Don't sing for Coke / I won't sing for nobody / Makes me look like a joke."" Fittingly, the post announcing Barclaycard's withdrawal from the event was headlined ""Sponsored By Nobody"". The 73-year-old is an active environmentalist, criticising the automotive industry, supporting anti-fracking activists and recording songs about climate change, including 2014's Who's Gonna Stand Up? (and Save The Earth). More recently, the star took President Trump to task over his response to the California wildfires, in which he lost his home.

"PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez: ""A rich country cannot have poor workers"" Spain's minimum wage will jump by 22% in 2019 - the largest annual increase in more than 40 years. It means millions of low-paid workers could see a pay rise from â¬736 ($835; Â£665) to â¬900, effective from January. Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez announced the increase on Wednesday, declaring ""a rich country cannot have poor workers"". The announcement comes two days after France's president Emmanuel Macron announced a â¬100 increase for minimum wage earners from 2019. Mr Macron's move came after weeks of sometimes violent protests from the ""gilets jaunes"" movement against high costs of living. Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' Spain country profile But while Spain's increase is part of an annual review, it is far higher than any adjustment in recent years. Spain's minimum wage is lower than that of the UK, Germany and France but higher than in other EU members including Portugal, Greece and Poland. Low-paid workers could see a pay rise from â¬736 to â¬900 Many workers in Spain are paid for 14 months of work, with extra payments in July and December - making the effective annual minimum salary â¬12,600. Ministers will approve the measure at their meeting on 21 December, Mr SÃ¡nchez said. It will then be authorised by royal decree, without the need for approval by parliament. Spain sets the minimum wage annually, but recent increases have been much smaller - set at just 4% a year ago. If all goes to according to plan, the increase will be the biggest since 1977, the year of Spain's first free elections following the death of dictator Francisco Franco. The large bump is the result of an ongoing attempt by Mr SÃ¡nchez's minority government to secure its political plans - including budget measures - with the help of anti-austerity party Podemos. Podemos claimed the minimum wage increase as a victory for the party, with its General Secretary RamÃ³n Espinar calling it ""the first step to balance the scales"". Mr SÃ¡nchez is also under pressure from Catalan separatist parties -they have refused to back himover rising tensions between the semi-autonomous region and Madrid - and from the success of far-right party Vox -it made gains in Andalusia's regional election. Four weekends of violent protests against fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues prompted Mr Macron to announce economic concessions. The effective increase of 7% will be met by the government rather than employers, at the cost of billions of euros in public money. Other measures included cancelling a planned tax increase for low-income pensioners, overtime pay no longer being taxed, and employers asked to pay a tax-free end of year bonus to employees. But Mr Macron did not reinstate a tax on the wealthy he had abolished, saying ""this would weaken us, we need to create jobs"".

"The pound has slipped back from its highs of earlier on Wednesday even though Prime Minister Theresa May won the vote of confidence in her leadership. After the result, it dipped to $1.2603, having hit a high of $1.2672 earlier. Of the the 317 Conservative MPs, 200 backed the prime minister, but 117 voted against her. XTB Online Trading said the ""far from comprehensive victory"" had caused ""some selling in the markets"". Chief market analyst David Cheetham said the pound had erased some of its earlier gains and headed back lower. However, the pound subsequently recovered ground and is still 1.14% up on the day against the dollar at $1.2635 and about 0.7% ahead against the euro at â¬1.1109. Currency traders had expected Mrs May to win the confidence vote, and the pound traded ahead for much of Wednesday. CIBC's head of foreign exchange strategy, Jeremy Stretch, described the outcome of the confidence vote as ""not a great result but not an absolute disaster"". He said the pound had not got near to $1.27 against the dollar and the ""scale of the win has for now limited [the pound's] impetus"". The challenge to Mrs May was brought by Conservative MPs who said Mrs May's deal with the EU had watered down the Brexit that voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. Her decision to cancel Tuesday's parliamentary vote on the deal prompted them to back a no confidence vote. Mrs May had meetings with European leaders on Tuesday, seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal in a last-ditch bid to save it. She will discuss further changes at an EU summit on Thursday. The European Union has ruled out renegotiating the divorce agreement. Parliament is set to vote on a deal before 21 January. XTB's Mr Cheetham said: ""Given that more than a third of her own party voted against her it seems increasingly implausible that she will get the requisite backing in Parliament to push through her deal. ""The result leaves the overall level of uncertainty at unprecedented heights - something that doesn't bode well for the pound,"" he added.

"Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence on Wednesday evening. Many of her MPs publicly said during the day which way they planned to vote ahead of the poll. The ballot was secret, so an MP's public declaration might not match up to the mark they made on the ballot paper. We now know that 200 Tory MPs backed her leadership, while 117 voted against. The figures below reflect how they said they would vote before the ballot.

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"Cardinal Pell faces trial in Australia on sex abuse charges Two cardinals facing allegations linked to sexual abuse have been removed from Pope Francis's inner circle, the Vatican said. Australia's George Pell and Chile's Francisco Javier Errazuriz will no longer sit on the Council of Cardinals, set up by the pope as an international advice body. The pair were absent from the last meeting of the group in September. A spokesperson said the Pope wrote to them both in October to thank them. Cardinal Pell, who remains the Vatican treasurer, faces trial on sexual abuse charges in Australia - accusations the cardinal strenuously denies. His Chilean colleague, Francisco Javier Errazuriz, faces accusations that he covered up alleged child abuse while serving as Archbishop of Santiago, claims he also denies. 'How I escaped the priest who abused me for decades' Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya has also left the group, spokesman Greg Burke said.

"Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence on Wednesday evening. Many of her MPs publicly said during the day which way they planned to vote ahead of the poll. The ballot was secret, so an MP's public declaration might not match up to the mark they made on the ballot paper. We now know that 200 Tory MPs backed her leadership, while 117 voted against. The figures below reflect how they said they would vote before the ballot.

"Ms Brockell said many other bereaved parents had contacted her to tell of similar experiences The mother of a stillborn child has called on tech companies to rethink how they target ads after she was inundated with baby-related promotions. Gillian Brockell wrote to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Experian, saying if they were smart enough to deduce she had been pregnant, they should have realised her baby had died. Other internet users have remarked that they have had similar experiences. Facebook and Twitter have acknowledged they could do better. Washington DC-based Ms Brockell posted a message to Twitter last month to share the news that her son had died in the womb. She suggested that the technology companies should have picked up on this or other online activity resulting from her son's death. Instead, she said, the companies remained focused on her earlier pregnancy-related posts and actions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""And then the announcement with keywords like 'heartbroken' and 'problem' and 'stillborn' and the 200 teardrop emoticons from my friends? Is that not something you could track?"" She added that when she had tried to actively discourage the technology companies from showing her the pregnancy-related promotions, they had misinterpreted her response. ""When we... click 'I don't want to see this ad,' and even answer your 'Why?' with the cruel-but-true 'It's not relevant to me,' do you know what your algorithm decides? ""It decides you've given birth, assumes a happy result, and deluges you with ads for the best nursing bras... tricks to get the baby to sleep through the night... and the best strollers to grow with your baby. ""And then, after all that, Experian swoops in with the lowest tracking blow of them all: a spam email encouraging me to 'finish registering your baby' (I never 'started' but sure) to track his credit throughout the life he will never lead."" Facebook's advertising chief, Rob Goldman, has been the first of the executives responsible to respond. He apologised for Ms Brockell's experience but noted that the platform's settings included an option to block ads about topics the user might find painful, including parenting. Facebook's settings let users ask for parenting ads to be blocked ""It still needs improvement, but please know that we're working on it,""he added,external.

"Cardinal Pell faces trial in Australia on sex abuse charges Two cardinals facing allegations linked to sexual abuse have been removed from Pope Francis's inner circle, the Vatican said. Australia's George Pell and Chile's Francisco Javier Errazuriz will no longer sit on the Council of Cardinals, set up by the pope as an international advice body. The pair were absent from the last meeting of the group in September. A spokesperson said the Pope wrote to them both in October to thank them. Cardinal Pell, who remains the Vatican treasurer, faces trial on sexual abuse charges in Australia - accusations the cardinal strenuously denies. His Chilean colleague, Francisco Javier Errazuriz, faces accusations that he covered up alleged child abuse while serving as Archbishop of Santiago, claims he also denies. 'How I escaped the priest who abused me for decades' Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya has also left the group, spokesman Greg Burke said.

"Theresa May won a vote of confidence on Wednesday evening, which was called after the required 48 letters demanding a contest were submitted. But despite winning, her future looks far from certain. Here - based on the latest odds at the bookmakers - are the fancied runners tipped to be vying for the top job, if and when Mrs May's tenure as prime ministers comes to an end. None has so far declared their intention to stand. Boris Johnson, 54, was the face of the campaign to get Britain out of the EU and did little to disguise his disappointment with Mrs May's Brexit plan, eventuallyresigning as foreign secretary over it. The former London mayor has long harboured leadership ambitions and isa big favourite with Conservative Party members,externalbut he would first have to get the backing of enough MPs to make into the ballot of members - no easy task. His first bid for the leadership, following the 2016 referendum, ended in disaster after fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the 11th hour and put himself forward instead, prompting Mr Johnson to withdraw from the race. Dominic Raab, 44, had already been a long-standing Eurosceptic when he became part of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. The former Brexit secretary resigned in Novemberover what he described as ""fatal flaws"" in the prime ministers draft Brexit agreement. The former lawyer has refused to rule out standing in a leadership contest and is said to be ""relaxed"" about a no-deal scenario, which will appeal to Brexiteer MPs. He warned on Thursday that if Mrs May continues as prime minister, there is a ""greater risk of a Jeremy Corbyn government"". He added: ""We will have to back her as best we can but the problem is that both in relation to Brexit and the wider sustainability of the government, given the likelihood of any changes to the deal, given the likely scale of opposition, it looks very difficult to see how this prime minister can lead us forward."" A former protege of George Osborne, 49-year-old Sajid Javid became the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background in April, following Amber Rudd's resignation. Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the 2016 referendum. An MP since 2010, he has previously served as business secretary and then culture secretary, and was part of a short-lived ""joint ticket"" leadership bid in 2016, hoping to become chancellor with Stephen Crabb as PM. After the vote, he tweeted: ""Right, vote over. Time to come together, deliver Brexit and so much more."" Michael Gove, 51, made a dramatic comeback in June 2017 when he returned to the cabinet as environment secretary, just a year after he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle following Mrs May's leadership victory. The former justice and education secretary came third in the last leadership contest, after withdrawing his support from fellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson and deciding to stand himself. Mr Gove has not ruled himself out to succeed Mrs May but played down speculation, saying it was ""extremely unlikely"" he would stand and tweeting on Wednesday that he was ""backing the Prime Minister 100%"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, 52, had always been seen as a Eurosceptic but was one of the figures supporting the David Cameron Remain position during the 2016 referendum. Mr Hunt, who was the longest serving health secretary in the history of the NHS before being promoted to foreign secretary, is considered a close ally of Theresa May. However he has faced a number of controversies during his career, including a battle over a new contract for junior doctors in 2015. Mr Hunt tweeted his congratulations to Mrs May after the vote, saying her ""stamina, resilience and decency has again won the day"". The former Brexit secretary was the first minister to quit over Mrs May's Chequers plan in July, saying he couldn't back a policy he didn't believe in. An MP since 1987, Mr Davis, 69, first stood to be Conservative leader in 2001 and was an overwhelming favourite to replace Michael Howard in 2005 but lost out to David Cameron. He went on to serve as shadow home secretary under Mr Cameron but dramatically resigned his seat and frontbench role in protest at plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He successfully fought a by-election and returned to the backbenches before unexpectedly being propelled back into frontline politics as Brexit secretary after the 2016 referendum. Amber Rudd only returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary in November afterresigning as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. She was a leading Remain campaigner in the 2016 referendum and although being a vocal supporter of the PM's Brexit plan, she has also proposed an alternative, which would see the UK being more closely tied to the EU. The 55-year-old MP has a slim majority of 346 in her Hastings constituency and the risk of losing her seat could hinder her chances. On Thursday, she said the vote has put an end to the leadership question. She said Mrs May has ""got the support of the party behind her"" and that she hopes the government can now get on with delivering a successful exit from the EU. BrexiteerEsther McVey, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal has already shown her ability to bounce back after losing her seat in 2015. Penny Mordauntwas a leading figure in the Leave campaign in 2016 and despite appearing reluctant to explicitly back Theresa May's Brexit plan, she has not resigned from her cabinet role as international development secretary. Liz Truss, currently second-in-command at the Treasury, has been building up her profile with some memorable party conference appearances. Commons leaderAndrea Leadsom, a Brexiteer who challenged Mrs May in 2016 before withdrawing, might fancy another go Attorney GeneralGeoffrey Coxwas a big hit at this year's Tory conference, with a theatrical speech, prompting talk of him as a future leader. Priti Patel, a Brexiteer who quit the government over private trips to Israel, has a strong base of support which is reflected in the betting. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for Mrs May to go, has previously denied having leadership ambitions. Might he change his mind? Theresa May's second-in-commandDavid Lidington, a Remain supporter, also features in the betting. BackbencherTom Tugendhat, Cabinet ministersMatthew HancockandGavin Williamson, backbencherJames Cleverlyand Scottish Tory leaderRuth Davidsonare also on the bookmakers' lists as outsiders. Remain-supporting former education secretaryJustine Greeninghasnot ruled out standing if a vacancy arose. Could Boris Johnson be challenged again?

"This video can not be played ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May Theresa May addressed Conservative MPs shortly before they began casting their ballots in a vote of confidence in her as their party leader. As the prime minister arrived, her colleagues weren't quite sure of the result. One member of the government told me the result of the ballot would be closer than expected - not a comfortable victory. Another member of the cabinet told me it would change nothing - it was an exercise in futility. Expectation right now is that she will win. But the prime minister has said that she'll go - though not just yet. MPs voting on Theresa May's future Politics Live: Rolling updates on confidence vote She'll have what a loyal minister described as a ""little more time"". But to do what? Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing. So the prime minister is left tonight even with a likely victory, with less time in office, less authority, and with no credible Brexit policy - and now, even more to do.

"Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence on Wednesday evening. Many of her MPs publicly said during the day which way they planned to vote ahead of the poll. The ballot was secret, so an MP's public declaration might not match up to the mark they made on the ballot paper. We now know that 200 Tory MPs backed her leadership, while 117 voted against. The figures below reflect how they said they would vote before the ballot.

"The pound has slipped back from its highs of earlier on Wednesday even though Prime Minister Theresa May won the vote of confidence in her leadership. After the result, it dipped to $1.2603, having hit a high of $1.2672 earlier. Of the the 317 Conservative MPs, 200 backed the prime minister, but 117 voted against her. XTB Online Trading said the ""far from comprehensive victory"" had caused ""some selling in the markets"". Chief market analyst David Cheetham said the pound had erased some of its earlier gains and headed back lower. However, the pound subsequently recovered ground and is still 1.14% up on the day against the dollar at $1.2635 and about 0.7% ahead against the euro at â¬1.1109. Currency traders had expected Mrs May to win the confidence vote, and the pound traded ahead for much of Wednesday. CIBC's head of foreign exchange strategy, Jeremy Stretch, described the outcome of the confidence vote as ""not a great result but not an absolute disaster"". He said the pound had not got near to $1.27 against the dollar and the ""scale of the win has for now limited [the pound's] impetus"". The challenge to Mrs May was brought by Conservative MPs who said Mrs May's deal with the EU had watered down the Brexit that voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. Her decision to cancel Tuesday's parliamentary vote on the deal prompted them to back a no confidence vote. Mrs May had meetings with European leaders on Tuesday, seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal in a last-ditch bid to save it. She will discuss further changes at an EU summit on Thursday. The European Union has ruled out renegotiating the divorce agreement. Parliament is set to vote on a deal before 21 January. XTB's Mr Cheetham said: ""Given that more than a third of her own party voted against her it seems increasingly implausible that she will get the requisite backing in Parliament to push through her deal.

"This video can not be played ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will fight a challenge to her leadership with ""everything I've got"". Here is her statement in full. ""Sir Graham Brady has confirmed that he has received 48 letters from Conservative MPs so there will now be a vote of confidence in my leadership of the Conservative Party. ""I will contest that vote with everything I've got. ""I have been a member of the Conservative Party for over 40 years. ""I've served it as an activist, councillor, MP, shadow minister, home secretary and now as prime minister. Theresa May faces no confidence vote Live updates: Theresa May faces challenge ""I stood to be leader because I believe in the Conservative vision for a better future; a thriving economy with nowhere and nobody left behind; a stronger society where everyone can make the most of their talents - always serving the national interest. ""And at this crucial moment in our history, that means securing a Brexit deal that delivers on the result of the EU referendum. ""Taking back control of our borders, laws and money, but protecting jobs, our security and our precious union as we do so. ""Through good times and bad over the last two years, my passionate belief that such a deal is attainable, that a bright future lies ahead for our country, has not wavered and it is now within our grasp. ""I spent yesterday meeting Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Rutte,  President Tusk and President Juncker to address the concerns that MPs have with the backstop, and we are making progress. ""I was due to travel to Dublin this afternoon to continue that work, but will now remain here in London to make the case for my leadership with my parliamentary colleagues. ""A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now will put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it. ""A new leader wouldn't be in place by the 21 January legal deadline, so a leadership election risks handing control of the Brexit negotiations to opposition MPs in Parliament. Analysis: No surprise in May's defiance Guide: Rules for challenge to Theresa May ""The new leader wouldn't have time to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement and get the legislation through Parliament by 29 March, so one of their first acts would have to be extending or rescinding Article 50, delaying or even stopping Brexit, when people want us to get on with it. ""And a leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the parliamentary arithmetic. ""Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division, just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest. ""The only people whose interests would be served are Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. ""The British people want us to get on with it and they want us to focus on the other vital issues that matter to them too - building a stronger economy, delivering first class public services and the homes that families need. ""These are the public's priorities, and they must be the Conservative Party's priorities too. Who has written no confidence letters? Brexit: A really simple guide ""We must - and we shall - deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead. ""But the Conservatives must not be a single issue party; we are a party of the whole nation. ""Moderate, pragmatic, mainstream: committed to re-uniting our country and building a country that works for everyone - the agenda I set out in my first speech outside this front door. ""Delivering the Brexit people voted for, building a country that works for everyone.

"It turns out that Harold Wilson was wrong when he said a week is a long time in politics. In these fraught times at Westminster a long time is measured in hours, minutes or even seconds. On Tuesday night ministers were suggesting in private that Theresa May would lose today's vote of confidence in her leadership. A key rule of the process - that victory would keep her in place for a year - was counting against her on Tuesday. Why? Because that would mean she would lead the Tories into an early general election, the one thing Tory MPs agree must not happen. Wind the clock forward to Wednesday morning and another rule of the process - that the confidence vote must be held promptly - is now counting in the prime minister's favour. Guide: Rules for challenge to Theresa May Brexit: Tory resentment of Irish power Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No 10 aides are taking nothing for granted and know full well that the end of the May premiership could well be signalled at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday when Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, reads out the result. But if Theresa May pulls it off, there are three factors that would explain how she could replace Bill Clinton as the ""comeback kid"". The factors are: Speed. The speed of the contest has allowed the prime minister to frame the choice before MPs. Sir Graham Brady gave a flavour of the speed of the contest this morning when he said he spoke to May at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday night and made a point of announcing before the financial markets opened on Wednesday morning that a vote would be held. Amid murmurings from his fellow Brexiteers that he was skewing the vote in her favour, Brady said he was following the rules which say the vote should be held promptly. Framing. In framing the choice before Tory MPs this morning, the prime minister reached out to the majority of Conservative MPs who want a negotiated Brexit. She said her successor would not be in place by 21 January - the legal deadline for a deal. That could mean that the next leader may have to extend article 50, delaying or even stopping Brexit. No alternative candidate. A change in party rules means that the prime minister may be helped by one big difference between today's vote and the last time a sitting Conservative prime minister was challenged without having triggered a contest. In challenging Margaret Thatcher, Michael Heseltine could stand up and outline how he would deal with the two big issues that had prompted the loss of confidence in Thatcher - the council tax and Europe. Wednesday is a confidence vote, not round one of a leadership contest. That means that none of the likely contenders in a leadership contest that would be triggered by a loss tonight - Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Amber Rudd and Sajid Javid - are on the airwaves. So the only big voice is Theresa May. During prime minster's questions, there were big cheers on Mrs May's benches when Kenneth Clarke warned that a leadership contest would be a terrible distraction. The man she describes as her ""rock"" - her husband Philip May - watched Theresa May from the Commons gallery. ""The prime minister is in remarkable form,"" one aide said. No 10 will be hoping that mood lasts beyond 21:00 GMT Wednesday. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or oniPlayer.

"A comedian has turned down a gig at a university after being asked to sign a ""behavioural agreement"" first. Konstantin Kisin was warned about a ""no tolerance policy"" on topics including racism, sexism and transphobia. He was asked to perform at a gig at the School of African and Oriental Studies (SOAS) in London, organised by university society Unicef on Campus. The group has since apologised and the Students' Union says it ""believes fully in freedom of speech"". Konstantin told Radio 1 Newsbeat the experience reflects a growing trend of free speech becoming stifled on university campuses across the UK. He shared the ""behavioural agreement form"" online, saying the title ""nearly made me puke"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I just think it reflects an attitude among a group of people, people at university particularly, where it seems that they have become places of indoctrination rather than learning,"" he said. ""Students are being taught to prevent offence rather than to seek truth and pursue experiences. ""Universities used to be all about that, but now it seems they're places where students are being taught to be woke. I think it reflects a broader issue, where increasingly there are people who value safety, or what they perceive to be safety."" The full list of topics listed by the organisers were ""racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism"". The contract said: ""It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed. But it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way."" Konstantin, who was born in the Soviet Union, says that he's since referenced the experience on stage. ""I was performing at Comedy Unleashed. It's a comedy night specifically focused on ensuring that comedians have a place where they don't self-censor,"" he explains. ""I read [Unicef on Campus]'s letter and it got a lot of groans and frustrated responses from the audience."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We would never wish to impose that guests would have to agree to anything they do not believe in. ""We apologise for the misunderstanding."" A spokesperson for SOAS Students' Union said it ""does not require speakers to sign any form of contract or behavioural agreement"". Konstantin also hosts Triggernometry, a YouTube show that focuses on issues such as the gender pay gap, which Konstantin describes as ""the kind of thing that you might not be able to talk about"". ""We are trying to create a space where these discussions can be had in a nuanced, long-form way, so we interview people for an hour and we don't interrupt them very much - we try and let them speak,"" he explains. But he also insists that he's never been out to deliberately cause offence - he's simply offering a fresh take on his 20 years in the UK as a Russian immigrant. ""I'm from Russia, I joke aboutNovichokand I joke about the fact that I'm Russian and my wife is Ukrainian -that's a whole big issueright now,"" he says. ""I make fun of British people and that's a kind of 'Hey I'm a foreigner and that's what I've noticed about you guys'."" Still, he's certain that offence can be found in almost any comedian's set. ""If you choose to find offence then there's plenty of room to do so,"" he says. ""I didn't turn down this gig because I'm some racist, homophobic, xenophobic, ableist comedian. I turned down this gig because if you sign a contract like that, you're exposing yourself to someone's bad interpretation. ""If someone writes a contract like that, the chances are that they will be hypersensitive, vigilant and trying to catch you out. I'm just not interested in that.""

"A majority of Tory MPs have said they want Boris Johnson to remain party leader and prime minister. But critics suggest his authority has been undermined and he still faces challenges to keep his job. All 359 Conservative MPs took part in the vote. Mr Johnson received the support of 211 of them, with 148 voting against him. The result means Mr Johnson was supported by 59% of his MPs. As the ballot was held in secret, Tory MPs don't have to say how they voted, but some have chosen to do so. The PM will know his opponents are not defeated Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to have been challenged. Theresa May: In a vote over her Brexit policy, Mrs May survived a confidence vote witha majority of 83 in December 2018. Despite winning, she resigned as PM six months later Iain Duncan Smith:Following months of speculation the Tory leadernarrowly lost a confidence vote in October 2003,externaland resigned John Major:Triggered a contest in 1995 byresigning as leader of the Tory party(though not as prime minister) amid disagreements inside the party over Europe. Mr Major beat challenger John Redwood, but went on to lose the 1997 election Margaret Thatcher:Resigned as PM in 1990 afterfailing to win outright victory for party leadership,external. She beat Michael Heseltine by 204 votes to 152, but was persuaded to stand down by her Cabinet Having survived, Mr Johnson can continue as Conservative Party leader and therefore prime minister. However, by-elections to pick new MPs in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton will be held on 23 June. If they are taken by opposition parties, Mr Johnson could find himself under renewed pressure. Although Mr Johnson won the vote, MPs could still consider options to try to remove him: Change the rules At present, Conservative MPs will not be allowed to hold another confidence vote for a year. However, there has been speculation the rules could be changed, in order to hold another vote sooner. When asked about it, Sir Graham Brady MP - the chairman of a group called the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory backbenchers - said ""technically, it's possible"". Cabinet pressure The Cabinet - made up senior members of the government - could put political pressure on the PM to resign. This happened toMargaret Thatcher in 1990,external, despite having defeated Michael Heseltine who had challenged for the leadership. A far less likely route would be for the Cabinet to go the Queen and declare they don't have confidence in the PM. However, this ""would drag the Queen into a very difficult position"" says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government. Motion of no confidence in the prime minister A confidence vote where all MPs - not just Conservatives - get to vote has been proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. The government is very unlikely to make time in Parliament to hold such a vote, according to Ms Haddon. However, if the leader of the opposition - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time. It would need just one more MP to vote in favour than the number voting against in order to pass. However, Tory MPs are very unlikely to go down this path says Ms Haddon: ""They would only use this mechanism as a last resort if they had no other way to dislodge Boris Johnson."" If Mr Johnson stood down, a leadership contest would be triggered. The eventual winner would become prime minister. In order to stand, candidates need the support of eight other Tory MPs. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. in the first round, candidates must get 5% of the votes to stay in the running (18 MPs) in the second round, they must get 10% (36 MPs) in the following rounds, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country - not just MPs - will vote for the winner.

"Sana news agency released pictures of forensics experts examining the grave Hundreds of unidentified bodies which seem to have been tortured have been found in a former Islamic State group stronghold, Syrian state media says. Seven mass graves near Albu Kamal in eastern Syria have been unearthed, the official Sana news agency reports, with more than 100 bodies recovered so far. Most seem to ""have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment before execution"", Sana says. IS has been accused of numerous atrocities in Iraq and Syria. A Syrian Red Crescent official told AFP news agency there were several women among the dead, and said some of those killed ""were blindfolded and handcuffed"". The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Syria forces drove the jihadist group from Albu Kamalin Deir al-Zour province on the border with Iraq last year. At the peak of the group's power, about 10 million people lived in IS-controlled areas, but the US military said earlier this year that the jihadists had been ousted from 98% of their former territory. Other mass graves have been found in areas once controlled by Islamic State group In Syria, the group is still present in small pockets in the south and east. Where their forces have been ousted, evidence of atrocities have been uncovered.

"The Zomato delivery driver was filmed eating food from his delivery bag The sacking of a food delivery man in India after he was filmed eating a client's food and resealing the containers has sparked a conversation about the delivery industry in the country. The BBC finds out more. The video, which was filmed in Madurai in southern India, shows the delivery man, who is wearing a T-shirt from popular Indian food delivery app Zomato, eating food out of boxed orders then resealing them and putting them back into a delivery bag. Initially met with disgust, anger and ridicule, the video was watched thousands of times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The social reactions prompted Zomato, one of India's biggest food delivery companies, to react with a statement that they took ""food tampering very seriously"". ""We have spoken to him at length and while we understand that this was a human error in judgement, we have taken him off our platform,"" the company added. Delivery man caught eating client's food India jobs: The signs point to a bleak outlook for employment Gig economy: The future, or exploitative? However, with the news that Zomato had decided to terminate the employment of the unidentified delivery man, the conversation began to turn more sympathetic. Many pointed to long work hours, difficult conditions and poor pay as serious issues faced by delivery employees. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some delivery people the BBC spoke to described similar problems. ""Earlier we used to get 60 rupees [85 cents] per delivery. Then from 60 it became 40. Still I continued because I had to educate my children. Now the company is planning to make it 30 rupees per delivery. But I have expenses - petrol is expensive, I have children as well. Tell me what should I do?"" one delivery person, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. Another said ""I am the sole bread earner in my family. In case I have an accident, I don't have an insurance policy. The company doesn't give us insurance either. If there is a mishap then I will be in trouble. The company should think about that."" App-based delivery is a relatively new business in India, but has seen huge levels of growth in a short time. Apart from food, Indians can now also order things like groceries and even furniture to be delivered to their homes. Retail delivery giants like Amazon and Flipkart, which was recently acquired by Walmart, also employ tens of thousands of people to act as delivery staff. BeyoncÃ© sings at India's A-list wedding How did an eel get up this seal's nose? RIP Roger the enormous kangaroo With an estimated six to eight million people joining the Indian workforce every year and with jobs not growing anywhere close to that rate, many people are willing to accept even menial jobs with exploitative work conditions just so that they earn some level of income. Zomato says it employs around 150,000 delivery people across India, while Swiggy, another food delivery app, said it has around 100,000 active delivery partners at any given time. While many companies do not share specifics of how much they deliver every month, Zomato recently put out a statementwhich claimed that they were receiving around 21 million food orders every month,external. There is no overall financial estimation of how much the industry is worth. However, both Swiggy and Zomato have denied that they ask their delivery partners to meet unreasonable deadlines or impose fines on those who do not meet ""targets"". ""All our delivery partners are independent contractors and choose to login (when and for as long as they want to) as per their own will for delivering food through our platform. They are free to go offline and come back online after any duration (be it an hour, day or week). Hence, all partners are advised to go offline when they want to take a break,"" a representative from Zomato told the BBC. Both companies also said that they provided their delivery people with benefits like insurance. One delivery person, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Deepak, confirmed that he has never been penalised for taking a break. But with companies hiring more and more delivery people, it was getting harder for him to earn more money and customers almost never tipped, he said. He also told the BBC that he had seen the video of the Zomato delivery person, but said he had ""no sympathy"" for him. ""Wrong is wrong. Where is the question of sympathy? He shouldn't have done this. If someone gave you jhoota [half-eaten] food would you eat it?""

"This video can not be played ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May Theresa May addressed Conservative MPs shortly before they began casting their ballots in a vote of confidence in her as their party leader. As the prime minister arrived, her colleagues weren't quite sure of the result. One member of the government told me the result of the ballot would be closer than expected - not a comfortable victory. Another member of the cabinet told me it would change nothing - it was an exercise in futility. Expectation right now is that she will win. But the prime minister has said that she'll go - though not just yet. MPs voting on Theresa May's future Politics Live: Rolling updates on confidence vote She'll have what a loyal minister described as a ""little more time"". But to do what? Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing. So the prime minister is left tonight even with a likely victory, with less time in office, less authority, and with no credible Brexit policy - and now, even more to do.

"Theresa May won a vote of confidence on Wednesday evening, which was called after the required 48 letters demanding a contest were submitted. But despite winning, her future looks far from certain. Here - based on the latest odds at the bookmakers - are the fancied runners tipped to be vying for the top job, if and when Mrs May's tenure as prime ministers comes to an end. None has so far declared their intention to stand. Boris Johnson, 54, was the face of the campaign to get Britain out of the EU and did little to disguise his disappointment with Mrs May's Brexit plan, eventuallyresigning as foreign secretary over it. The former London mayor has long harboured leadership ambitions and isa big favourite with Conservative Party members,externalbut he would first have to get the backing of enough MPs to make into the ballot of members - no easy task. His first bid for the leadership, following the 2016 referendum, ended in disaster after fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the 11th hour and put himself forward instead, prompting Mr Johnson to withdraw from the race. Dominic Raab, 44, had already been a long-standing Eurosceptic when he became part of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. The former Brexit secretary resigned in Novemberover what he described as ""fatal flaws"" in the prime ministers draft Brexit agreement. The former lawyer has refused to rule out standing in a leadership contest and is said to be ""relaxed"" about a no-deal scenario, which will appeal to Brexiteer MPs. He warned on Thursday that if Mrs May continues as prime minister, there is a ""greater risk of a Jeremy Corbyn government"". He added: ""We will have to back her as best we can but the problem is that both in relation to Brexit and the wider sustainability of the government, given the likelihood of any changes to the deal, given the likely scale of opposition, it looks very difficult to see how this prime minister can lead us forward."" A former protege of George Osborne, 49-year-old Sajid Javid became the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background in April, following Amber Rudd's resignation. Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the 2016 referendum. An MP since 2010, he has previously served as business secretary and then culture secretary, and was part of a short-lived ""joint ticket"" leadership bid in 2016, hoping to become chancellor with Stephen Crabb as PM. After the vote, he tweeted: ""Right, vote over. Time to come together, deliver Brexit and so much more."" Michael Gove, 51, made a dramatic comeback in June 2017 when he returned to the cabinet as environment secretary, just a year after he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle following Mrs May's leadership victory. The former justice and education secretary came third in the last leadership contest, after withdrawing his support from fellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson and deciding to stand himself. Mr Gove has not ruled himself out to succeed Mrs May but played down speculation, saying it was ""extremely unlikely"" he would stand and tweeting on Wednesday that he was ""backing the Prime Minister 100%"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, 52, had always been seen as a Eurosceptic but was one of the figures supporting the David Cameron Remain position during the 2016 referendum. Mr Hunt, who was the longest serving health secretary in the history of the NHS before being promoted to foreign secretary, is considered a close ally of Theresa May. However he has faced a number of controversies during his career, including a battle over a new contract for junior doctors in 2015. Mr Hunt tweeted his congratulations to Mrs May after the vote, saying her ""stamina, resilience and decency has again won the day"". The former Brexit secretary was the first minister to quit over Mrs May's Chequers plan in July, saying he couldn't back a policy he didn't believe in. An MP since 1987, Mr Davis, 69, first stood to be Conservative leader in 2001 and was an overwhelming favourite to replace Michael Howard in 2005 but lost out to David Cameron. He went on to serve as shadow home secretary under Mr Cameron but dramatically resigned his seat and frontbench role in protest at plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He successfully fought a by-election and returned to the backbenches before unexpectedly being propelled back into frontline politics as Brexit secretary after the 2016 referendum. Amber Rudd only returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary in November afterresigning as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. She was a leading Remain campaigner in the 2016 referendum and although being a vocal supporter of the PM's Brexit plan, she has also proposed an alternative, which would see the UK being more closely tied to the EU. The 55-year-old MP has a slim majority of 346 in her Hastings constituency and the risk of losing her seat could hinder her chances. On Thursday, she said the vote has put an end to the leadership question. She said Mrs May has ""got the support of the party behind her"" and that she hopes the government can now get on with delivering a successful exit from the EU. BrexiteerEsther McVey, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal has already shown her ability to bounce back after losing her seat in 2015. Penny Mordauntwas a leading figure in the Leave campaign in 2016 and despite appearing reluctant to explicitly back Theresa May's Brexit plan, she has not resigned from her cabinet role as international development secretary. Liz Truss, currently second-in-command at the Treasury, has been building up her profile with some memorable party conference appearances. Commons leaderAndrea Leadsom, a Brexiteer who challenged Mrs May in 2016 before withdrawing, might fancy another go Attorney GeneralGeoffrey Coxwas a big hit at this year's Tory conference, with a theatrical speech, prompting talk of him as a future leader. Priti Patel, a Brexiteer who quit the government over private trips to Israel, has a strong base of support which is reflected in the betting. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for Mrs May to go, has previously denied having leadership ambitions. Might he change his mind? Theresa May's second-in-commandDavid Lidington, a Remain supporter, also features in the betting. BackbencherTom Tugendhat, Cabinet ministersMatthew HancockandGavin Williamson, backbencherJames Cleverlyand Scottish Tory leaderRuth Davidsonare also on the bookmakers' lists as outsiders. Remain-supporting former education secretaryJustine Greeninghasnot ruled out standing if a vacancy arose. Could Boris Johnson be challenged again?

"This video can not be played ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May Looking nervous but entirely determined, the prime minister's message this morning won't surprise anyone who knows her well: she will fight the challenge to her leadership with everything she has. But all the doubts, all the anxieties, all the unhappiness about the prime minister's leadership that have crystallised around the conundrum of Brexit have finally come to a head. Her party - not the opposition, not Parliament - deciding that her time may be up. But the prime minister who promised she would be strong and stable is instead at the top of a party that looks weak and chaotic at a vital time. Theresa May faces no confidence vote Guide: Rules for challenge to Theresa May She's in this position, her critics say, because of the choices and missteps she has made. But her supporters would say it was because for some people in the Tory party who have had years of fury about Europe, nothing would ever have been good enough. One of her cabinet colleagues is predicting a ""long day"" but a ""solid win"". Let's see. Digital protestations this morning from her colleagues online that they will back her don't necessarily translate into a win in a secret ballot. And if the prime minister wins, purgatory for a year, for those who are bitterly angry about her plans for Brexit. Their criticisms can't translate into anything more than shouts of protest. Purgatory for her too, carrying on with a Brexit compromise that right now she just can't yet pass.

"The number of homicides has hit the highest number since 2008 when there was 154 The number of killings in London has reached the highest number for a decade. The fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Jay Sewell in Eltham on Tuesday night means there have been 130 homicides in the capital since 1 January. The figure, which includes murders and manslaughters, is the highest number since 2008 when there were 154 deaths in a year. A spokesperson for London's mayor described the increase as ""shameful"". The Met Police said it was ""committed to reducing violent crime."" The 130 homicides this year has included 73 stabbings and 14 shootings. Mr Sewell, from Kent, died in a south London hospital after he arrived with another 18-year-old. Both of them had suffered serious stab wounds. They had been injured at about 21:50 GMT in Alwold Crescent where there were reports of armed youths in the street. Jay Sewell was attacked in Eltham Scotland Yard said five people - two women aged 53 and 29 and three men aged 56, 31 and 22 - had been arrested on suspicion of murder and all were in custody.

"Blunt has been recognised for two very different roles Emily Blunt is up for two prizes at next month's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, the nominations for which have just been announced. The British star is up for the guild's best film actress prize for Mary Poppins Returns, which is having its European premiere later in London. She is also up for a supporting actor award for horror film A Quiet Place, which husband John Krasinski directed. Christian Bale and Olivia Colman are among the other British nominees. The former is shortlisted for his role as former US vice president Dick Cheney in the political satire Vice. The latter is up for the best actress award for The Favourite, for which Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are also recognised. Mary Poppins Returns opens in the UK on 21 December Hugh Grant, Joseph Fiennes and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British talents in contention for the guild's television awards. Stone also receives a second nomination here for Netflix series Maniac, while Krasinski gets his own nod for acting in Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are both nominated for their acting in A Star is Born, which is also up for outstanding performance by a cast. Lady Gaga up for best actress Globe Black Panther, Black Klansman, Bohemian Rhapsody and Crazy Rich Asians are also shortlisted for the SAG equivalent to a best picture award. The Screen Actors Guild is an American labour union that represents performers in media around the world. It was founded in 1933 in an effort to eliminate exploitation of Hollywood actors who were being forced into multi-year contracts with major film studios - many of which were known for dictating the public and private lives of performers. The SAG Awards have been held since 1995 and is often seen as an indicator of success at the Academy Awards, so if these nominations are anything to go by, maybe the Brits will have a bit of luck on their side come Oscars season. The 25th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards will be presented in West Hollywood on 27 January. A full list of nominees is availableon the SAG website,external.

"Amanda Cox's death is being treated as unexplained Investigations are taking place into the death of a new mother who is thought to have collapsed after getting lost inside Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Amanda Cox, who was 34 and from Peebles in the Borders, was reported missing on Monday after failing to return to the maternity ward following a visit to see her son at the neonatal unit. She was found collapsed at about 22:00 after a five-hour search. Police said her death was being treated as unexplained, but not suspicious. NHS Lothian said it was helping police with their inquiry into the death. Ms Cox's family were not available for comment about her death. A family friend said Ms Cox had been suffering headaches since before the birth of her son, Murray, last Thursday. ""Apparently she was going back to her room for medication but took a wrong turning and came out of the neonatal ward into a disused ward,"" said the friend. The friend added that Murray, who weighed just 3lb 7oz, had been transferred to Edinburgh following his birth in Borders General Hospital. Amanda Cox was discovered collapsed inside Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Monday night In a statement Police Scotland said: ""We can confirm that missing woman Amanda Cox was discovered collapsed within the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary around 10pm on Monday December 10. ""She sadly passed away a short time later."" The statement added: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with Amanda's family and friends at this time."" Jim Crombie, deputy chief executive of NHS Lothian, said the health authority was assisting police with their inquiries. He added: ""My thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Amanda Cox at this sad time."" Local MSP Christine Grahame has sent her condolences to the Cox family and is seeking answers about why it took so long to find Amanda. She said ""This is appalling news. It's a tragedy for the family"" ""How over many hours, not just minutes, many hours this mother went missing in a hospital. ""How there was a search outside the grounds but nobody located her within the hospital. It should never have happened. It's dreadful and it must never happen again.""

"The number of homicides has hit the highest number since 2008 when there was 154 The number of killings in London has reached the highest number for a decade. The fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Jay Sewell in Eltham on Tuesday night means there have been 130 homicides in the capital since 1 January. The figure, which includes murders and manslaughters, is the highest number since 2008 when there were 154 deaths in a year. A spokesperson for London's mayor described the increase as ""shameful"". The Met Police said it was ""committed to reducing violent crime."" The 130 homicides this year has included 73 stabbings and 14 shootings. Mr Sewell, from Kent, died in a south London hospital after he arrived with another 18-year-old. Both of them had suffered serious stab wounds. They had been injured at about 21:50 GMT in Alwold Crescent where there were reports of armed youths in the street. Jay Sewell was attacked in Eltham Scotland Yard said five people - two women aged 53 and 29 and three men aged 56, 31 and 22 - had been arrested on suspicion of murder and all were in custody.

The woman lost her temper when told she could not take her child into the grotto in Stockton-on-Tees because she did not have a booking, police said.

"French police have appealed for help in finding a man suspected of a Christmas market gun attack in Strasbourg that killed three people, and left a fourth brain dead and 12 others wounded. Hundreds of security personnel are searching for Cherif Chekatt, 29, on both sides of the Franco-German border. The suspect had a string of criminal convictions and had become a radical Islamist while in prison. Police say he is highly dangerous and should not be approached. French officials announced on Thursday that a third person had died in the aftermath of the Strasbourg attack. Five people were seriously wounded, they said, including a man described as brain dead. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman Chekatt has been in jail in Germany as well as France, and German reports suggested he may have received a call from Germany shortly before the Strasbourg attack. He did not answer the call, but investigators were trying to establish who was behind it, RBB Inforadio reported. Border checks on drivers near Strasbourg brought traffic to a near standstill on Thursday The French government and police union urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. A 23-year-old protester was struck by a lorry and killed at a roundabout in Avignon on Wednesday night. The lights of Paris' Eiffel Tower were turned off overnight,externalin tribute to the victims of the Strasbourg attack. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the gesture was to show the city's support to the families affected and ""all of Strasbourg"". The Eiffel Tower in Paris goes dark in tribute to the victims and ""all of Strasbourg"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman, who was injured in an exchange of fire with soldiers who were patrolling the Christmas market in Strasbourg when the attack occurred. Across the nearby border, German police were conducting searches after France's Deputy Interior Minister, Laurent NuÃ±ez, acknowledged that the gunman might no longer be in France. Border agents were checking vehicles crossing the Rhine river, which marks the Franco-German frontier, leading to long lines of traffic in both directions. This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and helping a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Mr Castaner said the country had moved to the highest level of alert, expanding police powers and increasing vigilance. He added that security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up. The mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, has said the Christmas market there will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, with flags lowered to half-mast at the local town hall. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday, a man opened fire close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber, which attracts thousands of visitors. France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. As well as the fatalities, 12 people were wounded, six of them seriously, he added. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after commandeering a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker boasted to the taxi driver that he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him in the vicinity of the police station in the Neudorf area. When he got out the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping into the night. Four people connected to the suspect had been detained overnight in Strasbourg, Mr Heitz said. Sources close to the investigation quoted by Reuters news agency said they were the suspect's mother, father and two brothers. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. By Damian Grammaticas, Strasbourg Strasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place. The lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. ""We're all shaken up,"" he said. At this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways. ""Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid,"" said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly. Strasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: ""It's shameful."" Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife. The Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports  that he was in a serious condition. One soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman. Strasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past. Not only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack. In 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot.Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later,externalfor their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack. However, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Cohen walked free from court - but will have to report to jail in March US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who once said heâd take a bullet for him, has lashed out at his ex-boss' ""dirty deeds"" as he was given a 36-month prison sentence. Cohen is the first member of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed over the special counsel's inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In a New York court Cohen, 52, blamed his crimes on Mr Trump. The disgraced attorney told Judge William Pauley on Wednesday that Mr Trump had caused him to ""follow a path of darkness rather than light"". He told the court his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" and that he ""felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds"". Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? Cohen will serve his term concurrently with a two-month sentence he was given for lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, a charge levelled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The judge gave Cohen until 6 March to report to Otisville prison in upstate New York. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). As he left the court, Cohen did not pause to speak to journalists. Mr Trump ignored reporters as they asked for his reaction later at the White House. If there's a lesson to be learned from the tale of the two Michaels, it's that deals with federal prosecutors are best done quickly. Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, when confronted by the special counsel's office, was quick to co-operate. He may end up with a sentence that includes no jail time. Michael Cohen, on the other hand, initially put up a legal fight. Prosecutors say he never fully co-operated. Now the 52-year-old is facing three years in prison. Another message from the fate of the two Trump associates is that Mr Trump's business dealings, not Russian election meddling, could present a greater legal threat to the president. According to Mr Cohen's lawyer, his client had the ""misfortune"" of being the president's personal lawyer, business partner and all-around fixer for more than a decade. When investigators began digging into his actions, they uncovered a variety of chargeable crimes. By all accounts, Mr Trump's larger business empire is getting similar scrutiny. His long-time accountant is co-operating with investigators. There's no telling where Mr Mueller's Russia investigation will end up, but one thing is clear - it's not the only shark circling the White House. The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation. Mr Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Mr Trump. One of those payments was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, to suppress a woman's allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. On Wednesday the Department of Justice also announced it had reached a deal with AMI to forego prosecution as long as the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 election"". The tabloid publisher also agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. Mr Trump has acknowledged the payments despite denying the affairs, and called them a private transaction unrelated to his campaign. The special counsel reached a plea deal with Cohen on one count of lying to Congress given his co-operation with the Russia inquiry. The president's former lawyer admitted to making false statements to Congress about a Trump property deal in Moscow during the 2016 election. During Wednesday's sentencing, Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said the special counsel probe ""is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate"", referring to the scandal that brought down Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Cohen's other convictions for tax evasion and bank fraud charges are unrelated to the president. In exchange for a more lenient sentence, he had offered information regarding his campaign finance violations, including payingadult film star Stormy Danielshush money at the behest of ""the candidate"", in what is understood to be a reference to Mr Trump. This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar Relations between Cohen, once considered Mr Trump's right-hand man, and the president have soured over the course of Cohen's criminal trials. Mr Trump, who calls Mr Mueller's inquiry a ""witch hunt"", has repeatedly criticised his former ally since he began co-operating with investigators. He told reporters last month that Cohen was ""weak"" and ""not a very smart person"". All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen arrived for his sentencing with members of his family In other Russia investigation developments, former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his talks with the Russian ambassador, has asked for leniency. Flynn's attorneys requested he serve no prison time as he has co-operated with the special counsel's investigation from the start. Last week, the special counsel's teamannounced that they would not be pursuing jail time for Flynnas he provided ""substantial"" details regarding the Trump campaign team and Russian officials. Cohen, Flynn and ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort are among a number of the president's aides being investigated by Mr Mueller's team. Mr Manafort - who has been convicted of fraud - had been co-operating with the special counsel's inquiry. But last Friday, Mr Mueller's team released a memo alleging he had breached a plea agreement by lying to investigators. Cohen leaves court.

"A heavy police presence remains on the streets of Strasbourg ""He came out from the porch of a building armed with a pistol in his hand, his arm outstretched."" One eyewitness to the shooting in Strasbourg told French media she stumbled into the path of the gunman - and was lucky to survive. Audrey was one of many people taking in the Christmas markets with some friends when the first shots rang out. ""He headed towards a gentleman walking in front of me and immediately fired a bullet at his head,"" she told Radio Monte Carlo (RMC). ""The man collapsed, and the guy opened fire again at someone else who fell to the ground too,"" she added. Her two friends ran, screaming. Audrey was left standing face-to-face with the shooter, paralysed with fear. ""He turned around, I was facing him,"" she told the radio station.,external""He ran off and went under another porch."" ""Why didn't he shoot at me? I don't know. I think I was extremely lucky. As everyone was screaming, he fled."" Another witness named Jonathan was working as a waiter when he heard the gunfire. ""I thought it was our slate that had just fallen outside,"" he told DerniÃ¨res Nouvelles D'Alsace,external. But then he discovered a man lying on the ground, bleeding. He quickly retreated inside and barricaded the restaurant, telling all his customers to get down. But then he discovered the injured man had not been alone - and had been waiting outside for his family. ""The wife, who was with her son in the restaurant, was in the bathroom - and when she came out, we had to tell her that her husband was shot,"" he told RMC.

The 34-year-old resident had been walking nearby when the attack happened, and found a man in his 50s lying wounded on the ground outside an ice cream parlour.

""He was losing a lot of blood."" A passing cyclist then stopped and told him she was a doctor and gave the man heart massage. He never saw the gunman, and the fate of the wounded man is not yet known. He ran off past a local cinema, where people were ""walking quietly down the street, who had not heard"". He warned whoever he could. Eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC about a similar experience. The streets were deserted early on Wednesday in the aftermath He heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him - but the man died. ""There are no ambulance services able to enter the area, apparently,"" he said, adding: ""After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was pointless."" In the nearby basketball stadium, sheltering residents broke into a rousing chorus of the national anthem in solidarity with the victims - something which was widely played on French television.

On income tax, Mr Mackay opted to raise the threshold where the lowest rates kick in by the rate of inflation, and froze the point at which people start paying the higher rate at Â£43,430. This means almost every tax payer in Scotland will pay no more tax next year than in the current financial year. However, with Chancellor Philip Hammond announcing in October that the higher rate threshold in the rest of the UK would rise to Â£50,000, it meant the gap between what higher earners pay in tax north and south of the border would grow. Mr Mackay insisted that ""now is not the time to cut tax for the highest earners at the expense of our public services"".

"This video can not be played Cohen walked free from court - but will have to report to jail in March US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who once said heâd take a bullet for him, has lashed out at his ex-boss' ""dirty deeds"" as he was given a 36-month prison sentence. Cohen is the first member of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed over the special counsel's inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In a New York court Cohen, 52, blamed his crimes on Mr Trump. The disgraced attorney told Judge William Pauley on Wednesday that Mr Trump had caused him to ""follow a path of darkness rather than light"". He told the court his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" and that he ""felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds"". Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? Cohen will serve his term concurrently with a two-month sentence he was given for lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, a charge levelled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The judge gave Cohen until 6 March to report to Otisville prison in upstate New York. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). As he left the court, Cohen did not pause to speak to journalists. Mr Trump ignored reporters as they asked for his reaction later at the White House. If there's a lesson to be learned from the tale of the two Michaels, it's that deals with federal prosecutors are best done quickly. Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, when confronted by the special counsel's office, was quick to co-operate. He may end up with a sentence that includes no jail time. Michael Cohen, on the other hand, initially put up a legal fight. Prosecutors say he never fully co-operated. Now the 52-year-old is facing three years in prison. Another message from the fate of the two Trump associates is that Mr Trump's business dealings, not Russian election meddling, could present a greater legal threat to the president. According to Mr Cohen's lawyer, his client had the ""misfortune"" of being the president's personal lawyer, business partner and all-around fixer for more than a decade. When investigators began digging into his actions, they uncovered a variety of chargeable crimes. By all accounts, Mr Trump's larger business empire is getting similar scrutiny. His long-time accountant is co-operating with investigators. There's no telling where Mr Mueller's Russia investigation will end up, but one thing is clear - it's not the only shark circling the White House. The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation. Mr Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Mr Trump. One of those payments was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, to suppress a woman's allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. On Wednesday the Department of Justice also announced it had reached a deal with AMI to forego prosecution as long as the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 election"". The tabloid publisher also agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. Mr Trump has acknowledged the payments despite denying the affairs, and called them a private transaction unrelated to his campaign. The special counsel reached a plea deal with Cohen on one count of lying to Congress given his co-operation with the Russia inquiry. The president's former lawyer admitted to making false statements to Congress about a Trump property deal in Moscow during the 2016 election. During Wednesday's sentencing, Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said the special counsel probe ""is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate"", referring to the scandal that brought down Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Cohen's other convictions for tax evasion and bank fraud charges are unrelated to the president. In exchange for a more lenient sentence, he had offered information regarding his campaign finance violations, including payingadult film star Stormy Danielshush money at the behest of ""the candidate"", in what is understood to be a reference to Mr Trump. This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar Relations between Cohen, once considered Mr Trump's right-hand man, and the president have soured over the course of Cohen's criminal trials. Mr Trump, who calls Mr Mueller's inquiry a ""witch hunt"", has repeatedly criticised his former ally since he began co-operating with investigators. He told reporters last month that Cohen was ""weak"" and ""not a very smart person"". All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen arrived for his sentencing with members of his family In other Russia investigation developments, former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his talks with the Russian ambassador, has asked for leniency. Flynn's attorneys requested he serve no prison time as he has co-operated with the special counsel's investigation from the start. Last week, the special counsel's teamannounced that they would not be pursuing jail time for Flynnas he provided ""substantial"" details regarding the Trump campaign team and Russian officials. Cohen, Flynn and ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort are among a number of the president's aides being investigated by Mr Mueller's team. Mr Manafort - who has been convicted of fraud - had been co-operating with the special counsel's inquiry. But last Friday, Mr Mueller's team released a memo alleging he had breached a plea agreement by lying to investigators. Cohen leaves court.

"Government guidance says services should develop evacuation plans The second phase of the Grenfell Tower inquiry is unlikely to start until the end of 2019, the chairman has said. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said there were some 200,000 documents still to disclose which would not be done before next autumn, more than two years after the fire which killed 72 people. The first phase, which concludes this week, centred on the night of the fire - the second will examine wider issues. Earlier, the inquiry heard the fire service had no tower evacuation plans. The Fire Brigades Union said Britain's fire services had no strategy for evacuating a high-rise building at the time of the Grenfell disaster. This was despitegovernment guidelines,externalwhich recommended contingency plans in case services needed to abandon the standard ""stay put"" advice. On the night of the fire at the tower block in North Kensington, west London, a policy of ""stay put"" was kept in place for around two hours after the blaze broke out. Both firefighters on the ground and in control rooms told residents they should remain in their flats. Governmentguidance published in 2014 says fire services should develop evacuation plans,externalfor when the standard ""stay put"" advice becomes ""untenable"". Sir Martin, the retired appeal court judge who is chairing the inquiry, will consider whether evacuating the building earlier could have saved lives. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Martin Seaward, the FBU's barrister, told the inquiry that developing practical drills for an evacuation plan would have been ""a major undertaking achievable only at the national level"". It would be ""too daunting"" even for a large fire service like London's, he said. Firefighters have previously given evidence that evacuations in such circumstances were not something they were trained to do. ""The incident commander was placed in an impossible position without an evacuation procedure in place,"" Mr Seaward said. He added that he hoped the inquiry would next consider why evacuation plans hadn't been developed. Before the Grenfell fire there had been a series of well-known smaller fires which spread rapidly, Mr Seaward told the inquiry. But he said procedures and training were not drawn up as a result. On Monday, a lawyer for the victimstold the inquirythat London Fire Brigade's leaders had let down residents and firefighters. The first phase of the inquiry's hearings - which ended on Wednesday - concentrated solely on the events of the night of 14 June 2017. The second phase will examine the refurbishment of the tower and concerns expressed by residents about fire safety. Sir Martin said that ""if all goes well"" the second half of the inquiry would take place closer to the tower in west London, after survivors and the bereaved struggled to get to the current central London venue. He said work had begun to digest 200,000 documents relating to the refurbishment, including the installation of cladding and insulation, which would ""tell much of the story"" of what went wrong.

Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson Finance Secretary Derek Mackay That's all from Holyrood Live on Wednesday 12 December 2018, the day Finance Secretary Derek Mackay published his draft budget. Scotland's finance secretary has said he will not pass on a tax break for higher earners that was announced by the Chancellor in his UK budget. Derek Mackay said ""now is not the time"" to cut taxes for higher earners as he unveiled his Scottish budget. It means the gap between top rate taxpayers in Scotland has widened compared to the rest of the UK. But Mr Mackay said most people would continue to pay less in Scotland than south of the border. He also pledged extra funding for education, the health service, local government and infrastructure as has set out his plans for tax and spending for the next year at Holyrood. The Conservatives claimed that higher earners were ""being punished in the SNP's Scotland,"" with people earning Â£50,000 in Scotland paying about Â£1,500 more a year than their counterparts south of the border.

Scotland's finance secretary will not pass on a tax break for higher earners that was announced by the chancellor in his UK budget. The SNP is a minority administration, so Mr Mackay needs some help to get his plans through the final vote, which should take place next February. The Scottish Greens have been his partners for the past two years but they are making threatening noises this year by saying they won't even enter formal negotiations until they see movement towards major reform of local government funding. The Lib Dems, who are normally at least in the conversation, have pulled out of talks altogether after their demand that the SNP step away from any plans for a new independence referendum. For similar constitutional reasons, a deal with Labour or the Conservatives looks vanishingly unlikely. This leaves the Greens in a strong position to make demands - and they have set their sights on scrapping the council tax in favour of ""a fairer system that protects services and cuts inequality"". What can Mr Mackay do to provide the ""meaningful progress"" on this front that Patrick Harvie is looking for? Will the tourist tax be enough, or is he going to have to move further? Expect the real horse-trading to begin in earnest between this announcement and the first votes on the budget bill in the new year. The independent economic forecaster, the Scottish Fiscal Commission, has producedforecasts on economic growth,externalfor the coming years and is predicting economic growth of 1.4% this year and 1.2% in 2019, which it says reflects ""stronger recent economic performance, a more positive prospect for earnings over the next few years"". The Commission forecasts that Â£15.2bn of the Scottish Budget will be raised by devolved taxes in 2019-20. Income tax raises the most revenue, forecast to be Â£11.7bn in the next financial year. Healthwas the big winner with the Scottish Government proposing an increase of almost Â£730m in health and care services, with much of the money being passed on in so-called ""Barnett consequentials"" from Westminster as a result of spending commitments by the UK government south of the border. Educationspending saw a real-terms increase including a Â£180m pot to raise standards in schools. Almost Â£500m has also been committed to aid the expansion of the early learning and childcare sector. Support forbusinesscomes in the shape of Â£5bn commitment for capital investment to be spent on modernising Scotland's infrastructure, including a new Â£50m fund for regenerating run down high streets. Initial funding of Â£130 million towards the establishment of a Scottish National Investment Bank has also been earmarked. Public sector payincreases of 3% for those earning up to Â£36,500 have also been proposed, while those who earn between Â£36,500 and Â£80,000 will see their wages increase by 2%. Separate to the draft budget, it has been announced that MSPs will receive a 2.3% increase taking their salaries to Â£63,579. Mr Mackay also said Scotland's 32local councilswill receive a real terms increase in both revenue and capital funding, taking the local government budget to Â£11.1bn. The Scottish government has also committed more cash to the Â£2.9bnjusticebudget, claiming the police resource budget will be protected in real terms. Income tax- anew five-band regimecame into force earlier this year and the finance secretary has decided to maintain the current rates. He will increase the starter and basic rate thresholds by inflation in a move designed to help the lowest paid. However, the Scottish higher rate threshold has been frozen - unlike in the rest of the UK where the threshold will go up to Â£50,000 from April next year - which Mr Mackay said would raise an extra Â£68m in revenue. The move means the divergence between the income tax regime in Scotland and the rest of the UK continues to grow.  Other taxes Elsewhere, the replacement system for stamp duty in Scotland (Land and Buildings Transaction Tax) is also being revamped with the amount that buy-to-let investors or holiday home buyers pay on a second residential purchase going up from 3% to 4%. The Scottish government's Small Business Bonus Scheme is maintained, while the non-domestic poundage rates paid by businesses will see a"" below-inflation increase"". Local authorities will once again be allowed to increase council tax levels by up to 3%. According to the Scottish Parliament  this is the first year that the new budget
process applies, hereâs a quick overview explainer of the committee / chamber
process... Now the Scottish government has published the Scottish budget, which will include a summary of how the Parliamentâs
committees have influenced the formulation of the budget. Ministers will now provide a more detailed response to individual committeesâ pre budget
reports withinfive sitting daysfrom the publication of the
Budget. Each committee will then have the opportunity to hear oral
evidence from their respective ministers on the detailed response. Committees and individual members will have the opportunity to propose alternative revenue and spending proposals through reasoned amendments to the Scottish government motion on the general principles of the Bill. If ministers do not intend to lodge formal amendments to reflect any reasoned amendments agreed by the Scottish Parliament at Stage 1 then they must provide a written explanation to the Finance and Constitution Committee in advance of Stage 2. Prior to the Stage 1 debate on the Budget Bill, there will be a debate in the Chamber on the committee pre-budget reports and the response of Ministers in the Budget. The debate will be led by the Finance and Constitution Committee and time will be provided during the debate for each relevant convener to set out how their committee has sought to influence the budget and to allow the Government an opportunity to respond. This debate will take place on24 January 2019. The Stage 1 Debate on the Budget Bill will take placew/c 28 January 2019. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokesman for the universities and colleges union, the UCU, said: ""This is a deeply disappointing budget for Scottish higher education. Today's real terms cut to the sector's funding will ultimately hit students the hardest.  If we value our universities and the teaching, knowledge exchange and research they provide, then we needed a funding settlement to match the politicians' warm words."" Mike Kirby, Unison's Scotland secretary, said: ""Today's Scottish government budget fails to make the investment in public services that our country needs. The Scottish government should have taken advantage of their tax powers to maintain essential public services. Instead they have further cut business tax and maintained the failed small business bonus scheme. The rise in local government funding is less than both Cosla and Audit Scotland say is necessary to maintain vital public services."" Allow Twitter content?

Finance Secretary Derek Mackay Finance Secretary Derek Mackay set out his tax and spending plans for the next financial year. Mr MacKay said his budget would protect Scotland from the worst effects of Brexit, but critics said it had ignored business pleas not to increase the income tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK. He said his budget would invest record sums in the health service, there's extra money for childcare, and education funding is protected. Also announced were a real terms cut in business rates, more affordable homes and extra apprenticeship places. On tax, lower income thresholds will increase by inflation, while higher thresholds will be frozen. The finance secretary says that means 99% of taxpayers will pay less tax than they do on their current income. But the Conservatives complained that the increased tax gap with England would damage business growth, and Labour argued the budget doesn't do enough to help children in poverty. MSPs will vote on the plans at the end of January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Zomato delivery driver was filmed eating food from his delivery bag The sacking of a food delivery man in India after he was filmed eating a client's food and resealing the containers has sparked a conversation about the delivery industry in the country. The BBC finds out more. The video, which was filmed in Madurai in southern India, shows the delivery man, who is wearing a T-shirt from popular Indian food delivery app Zomato, eating food out of boxed orders then resealing them and putting them back into a delivery bag. Initially met with disgust, anger and ridicule, the video was watched thousands of times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The social reactions prompted Zomato, one of India's biggest food delivery companies, to react with a statement that they took ""food tampering very seriously"". ""We have spoken to him at length and while we understand that this was a human error in judgement, we have taken him off our platform,"" the company added. Delivery man caught eating client's food India jobs: The signs point to a bleak outlook for employment Gig economy: The future, or exploitative? However, with the news that Zomato had decided to terminate the employment of the unidentified delivery man, the conversation began to turn more sympathetic. Many pointed to long work hours, difficult conditions and poor pay as serious issues faced by delivery employees. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some delivery people the BBC spoke to described similar problems. ""Earlier we used to get 60 rupees [85 cents] per delivery. Then from 60 it became 40. Still I continued because I had to educate my children. Now the company is planning to make it 30 rupees per delivery. But I have expenses - petrol is expensive, I have children as well. Tell me what should I do?"" one delivery person, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. Another said ""I am the sole bread earner in my family. In case I have an accident, I don't have an insurance policy. The company doesn't give us insurance either. If there is a mishap then I will be in trouble. The company should think about that."" App-based delivery is a relatively new business in India, but has seen huge levels of growth in a short time. Apart from food, Indians can now also order things like groceries and even furniture to be delivered to their homes. Retail delivery giants like Amazon and Flipkart, which was recently acquired by Walmart, also employ tens of thousands of people to act as delivery staff. BeyoncÃ© sings at India's A-list wedding How did an eel get up this seal's nose? RIP Roger the enormous kangaroo With an estimated six to eight million people joining the Indian workforce every year and with jobs not growing anywhere close to that rate, many people are willing to accept even menial jobs with exploitative work conditions just so that they earn some level of income. Zomato says it employs around 150,000 delivery people across India, while Swiggy, another food delivery app, said it has around 100,000 active delivery partners at any given time. While many companies do not share specifics of how much they deliver every month, Zomato recently put out a statementwhich claimed that they were receiving around 21 million food orders every month,external. There is no overall financial estimation of how much the industry is worth. However, both Swiggy and Zomato have denied that they ask their delivery partners to meet unreasonable deadlines or impose fines on those who do not meet ""targets"". ""All our delivery partners are independent contractors and choose to login (when and for as long as they want to) as per their own will for delivering food through our platform. They are free to go offline and come back online after any duration (be it an hour, day or week). Hence, all partners are advised to go offline when they want to take a break,"" a representative from Zomato told the BBC. Both companies also said that they provided their delivery people with benefits like insurance. One delivery person, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Deepak, confirmed that he has never been penalised for taking a break. But with companies hiring more and more delivery people, it was getting harder for him to earn more money and customers almost never tipped, he said. He also told the BBC that he had seen the video of the Zomato delivery person, but said he had ""no sympathy"" for him. ""Wrong is wrong. Where is the question of sympathy? He shouldn't have done this. If someone gave you jhoota [half-eaten] food would you eat it?""

"This video can not be played Froome, Brailsford and Thomas react to Sky's sponsorship withdrawal Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome says Team Sky will ""be doing everything we can"" to survive once their owner and main sponsor pulls out at the end of 2019. Broadcaster Skyannounced earlier on Wednesdaythat it would end its decade-long commitment after next season. ""I can't predict the future, but this is a really special team,"" said Froome, who won the Giro d'Italia in May. ""We plan to be together in 2020 if at all possible."" The British rider added: ""We will all be doing everything we can to help make that happen - in different colours with a new partner, but with the same values, focus and desire to win."" Sky to end backing in 2019 Other riders on Team Sky's books include reigning Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, Colombian prospect Egan Bernal, Dutchman Wout Poels, England's Ian Stannard and Wales' Luke Rowe. In an open letter to fans, the team admitted their future was in doubt. ""If we can find a new long-term partner to take the team forward into a new era, then we will do so,""it read.,external ""Equally, any future partner would have to be the right partner - one who shares our ethos and buys in to our values."" Froome, whose contract with Team Sky runs until the end of the 2020 season, paid tribute to the team's current backers. When they were launched in 2010, Team Sky's ambition of delivering a first British Tour de France winner by 2015 was seen as ambitious. They achieved that goal three years ahead of schedule thanks to Sir Bradley Wiggins' 2012 success. Between him, Froome and Thomas, Team Sky have won the yellow jersey in six of the past seven races. Speaking to BBC Sport from a training camp in Mallorca, Froome said he had only been told the news on Tuesday evening. ""Naturally we were all surprised to hear the news,"" he said. ""But at the same time we've got to remain optimistic and not lose focus on what we're trying to do. ""We've got big goals next year to win a lot of bike races. My target will be on the Tour de France and I've got every confidence if we can have a season next year that's similar to previous seasons, we'll be able to find another sponsor."" Froome said he did not think the decision would impact on his chances of winning a fifth Tour de France title. ""Nothing's changing in the team right now. We've got one more year to race and I think, if anything, it's given us even more motivation to go out and have the best season possible next year."" Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford claimed Sky's withdrawal was a ""new opportunity"" and a ""natural"" decision after 10 years in the sport. ""We know in life things change. When things do change you stay calm, bring the group together, stay strong and look for opportunities. Go out there with energy and excitement and build something new,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I like to build things, I'm an optimist."" Brailsford said he'd like Team Sky to be remembered for its ""impact on participation"", ""winning a lot"" and being a ""really high performing team"" that ""set high standards"". He also said he had already received calls ""expressing interest"", adding the future ""looks very good"" and said he takes his ""responsibility very seriously"" to make sure the team have a ""secure future"". Asked about the reaction to the news from Froome and Thomas he said it had been ""absolute class"" and showed why they are ""big champions on and off the bike"". Geraint Thomas signed a new deal with Team Sky after winning his maiden Tour de France title this year Thomas confirmed the possibility of Sky ending their sponsorship was not raised during his contract renewal talks, with the Welshman havingsigned a new three-year deal in September. He said the news was a ""shock"" and ""disappointing"" but that he was ""excited"" for the future direction of the team. ""It's been an incredible nine years so far and we want to go out on a high and make 2019 the last and the best year yet,"" he told BBC Sport. ""We're still confident in Dave and the team that they can continue and keep the team together. ""A lot of other teams have lost title sponsors but have continued - Movistar has been going for over 30 years with different sponsors. ""It's certainly not the end, or at least hopefully it's not the end, so it's also kind of exciting at the same time. It just gives everyone a bit more motivation to keep pushing on.""

The group has since apologised and the Students' Union says it ""believes fully in freedom of speech"".

""I just think it reflects an attitude among a group of people, people at university particularly, where it seems that they have become places of indoctrination rather than learning,"" he said. ""Students are being taught to prevent offence rather than to seek truth and pursue experiences. ""Universities used to be all about that, but now it seems they're places where students are being taught to be woke. I think it reflects a broader issue, where increasingly there are people who value safety, or what they perceive to be safety."" The full list of topics listed by the organisers were ""racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism"". The contract said: ""It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed. But it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way."" Konstantin, who was born in the Soviet Union, says that he's since referenced the experience on stage. ""I was performing at Comedy Unleashed. It's a comedy night specifically focused on ensuring that comedians have a place where they don't self-censor,"" he explains.

""I'm from Russia, I joke aboutNovichokand I joke about the fact that I'm Russian and my wife is Ukrainian -that's a whole big issueright now,"" he says. ""I make fun of British people and that's a kind of 'Hey I'm a foreigner and that's what I've noticed about you guys'."" Still, he's certain that offence can be found in almost any comedian's set. ""If you choose to find offence then there's plenty of room to do so,"" he says. ""I didn't turn down this gig because I'm some racist, homophobic, xenophobic, ableist comedian. I turned down this gig because if you sign a contract like that, you're exposing yourself to someone's bad interpretation. ""If someone writes a contract like that, the chances are that they will be hypersensitive, vigilant and trying to catch you out. I'm just not interested in that.""

"Superdry, best known for its coats and hoodies, has warned of weaker than expected profits, saying shoppers have not bought extra winter layers this year. It now expects annual profits of between Â£55m and Â£70m - analysts had been expecting around Â£84m. The announcement hit Superdry's shares and they closed more than 38% lower. The company is considering closing stores as part of a cost cutting drive to save Â£50m by 2022. ""Superdry had a difficult first half, impacted by unseasonably warm weather across our major markets, a consumer economy that is increasingly discount driven and the issues we are addressing in product mix and range,"" said Euan Sutherland, Superdry's chief executive officer. Underlying profit before tax almost halved in the first half of the year, to Â£12.9m. Superdry founder seeks return to the fold High Street crisis: How do we spend our money? November shopper footfall 'worst since recession' The retailer is a third of the way through an 18-month strategy to re-energise the brand which includes introducing childrenswear and 100% organic cotton products. Mr Sutherland said the firm's ""over-reliance"" on jackets and sweatshirts was partly to blame for flagging sales. He will oversee an efficiency drive which will include reviewing the number and size of their stores, and exploring renegotiating rents between now and March 2019. Superdry's shares were down by as much as 30% on Wednesday. They have lost more than 70% of their value this year. Superdry became popular with teenagers by providing high quality sweatshirts and other casual wear with a Japanese-style branding. However it has been losing ground and was dubbed recently by the Financial Times as a brand ""for cool dads"". ""It is a brand that hit a trend in the UK several years ago,"" said Maria Malone, from the Manchester Fashion Institute. ""Its customers are older, thirty plus, but the website features young models, this confuses the consumer."" The problem is that Superdry's products are neither high fashion nor very functional, and its style, reminiscent of American Classic or Gap, is ubiquitous, Ms Malone said. According to fashion retail analyst, Kate Hardcastle, the brand has saturated the market and has suffered from discount retailers producing copycat versions, ""To stay fashionable and engage with a buyer a brand has to have an air of exclusivity about it,"" she said. Superdry's founder Julian Dunkerton left the board in March. Since then he has criticised the retailer's strategy. He said the company should focus on its core jackets and hoodies and offer a far wider range of variations online: ""Superdry is a series of core products - stick with them and tweak them,"" he said. As part of its new strategy Superdry has launched a ""fast-fashion"" range aimed at a ""younger, more fashion-driven"" customer. The range mimics online retailers in going from design to delivery to consumers in six weeks and is being marketed via social media.

"It turns out that Harold Wilson was wrong when he said a week is a long time in politics. In these fraught times at Westminster a long time is measured in hours, minutes or even seconds. On Tuesday night ministers were suggesting in private that Theresa May would lose today's vote of confidence in her leadership. A key rule of the process - that victory would keep her in place for a year - was counting against her on Tuesday. Why? Because that would mean she would lead the Tories into an early general election, the one thing Tory MPs agree must not happen. Wind the clock forward to Wednesday morning and another rule of the process - that the confidence vote must be held promptly - is now counting in the prime minister's favour. Guide: Rules for challenge to Theresa May Brexit: Tory resentment of Irish power Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No 10 aides are taking nothing for granted and know full well that the end of the May premiership could well be signalled at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday when Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, reads out the result. But if Theresa May pulls it off, there are three factors that would explain how she could replace Bill Clinton as the ""comeback kid"". The factors are: Speed. The speed of the contest has allowed the prime minister to frame the choice before MPs. Sir Graham Brady gave a flavour of the speed of the contest this morning when he said he spoke to May at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday night and made a point of announcing before the financial markets opened on Wednesday morning that a vote would be held. Amid murmurings from his fellow Brexiteers that he was skewing the vote in her favour, Brady said he was following the rules which say the vote should be held promptly. Framing. In framing the choice before Tory MPs this morning, the prime minister reached out to the majority of Conservative MPs who want a negotiated Brexit. She said her successor would not be in place by 21 January - the legal deadline for a deal. That could mean that the next leader may have to extend article 50, delaying or even stopping Brexit. No alternative candidate. A change in party rules means that the prime minister may be helped by one big difference between today's vote and the last time a sitting Conservative prime minister was challenged without having triggered a contest. In challenging Margaret Thatcher, Michael Heseltine could stand up and outline how he would deal with the two big issues that had prompted the loss of confidence in Thatcher - the council tax and Europe. Wednesday is a confidence vote, not round one of a leadership contest. That means that none of the likely contenders in a leadership contest that would be triggered by a loss tonight - Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Amber Rudd and Sajid Javid - are on the airwaves. So the only big voice is Theresa May. During prime minster's questions, there were big cheers on Mrs May's benches when Kenneth Clarke warned that a leadership contest would be a terrible distraction. The man she describes as her ""rock"" - her husband Philip May - watched Theresa May from the Commons gallery. ""The prime minister is in remarkable form,"" one aide said. No 10 will be hoping that mood lasts beyond 21:00 GMT Wednesday. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or oniPlayer.

"Castlegate Shopping Centre says its elves have ""dusted themselves down"" since the upsetting flare-up An angry mum spat in the face of an elf at a shopping centre Christmas grotto. The woman lost her temper when told she could not take her child into the grotto in Stockton-on-Tees because she did not have a booking, police said. She also verbally abused other elves, said Karen Eve, manager of the Castlegate Shopping Centre, who added that the flare-up ""doesn't scream Christmas spirit at all"". Security has been stepped up at the centre and police are investigating.

"Finance Secretary Derek Mackay delivers the draft Budget 2019-20. Income tax rates will remain the same as last year with the higher rate threshold being frozen. However, the starter and lower rate threshold will be increased by inflation. A no deal Brexit could affect the Scottish government's spending plans, the minister tells MSPs. Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson Finance Secretary Derek Mackay That's all from Holyrood Live on Wednesday 12 December 2018, the day Finance Secretary Derek Mackay published his draft budget. Scotland's finance secretary has said he will not pass on a tax break for higher earners that was announced by the Chancellor in his UK budget. Derek Mackay said ""now is not the time"" to cut taxes for higher earners as he unveiled his Scottish budget. It means the gap between top rate taxpayers in Scotland has widened compared to the rest of the UK. But Mr Mackay said most people would continue to pay less in Scotland than south of the border. He also pledged extra funding for education, the health service, local government and infrastructure as has set out his plans for tax and spending for the next year at Holyrood. The Conservatives claimed that higher earners were ""being punished in the SNP's Scotland,"" with people earning Â£50,000 in Scotland paying about Â£1,500 more a year than their counterparts south of the border. Use our Budget calculator, developed byDeloitte,external, to find out how your pocket may be affected by the latest tax measures. If you live in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament now sets income tax rates and bands apart from the personal allowance. The UK Parliament continues to be responsible for national insurance, fuel, alcohol and cigarette duty. Some changes will not be seen until future financial years and are not included in this calculator. The Scottish budget is a draft proposal and still has to be agreed by MSPs.

Scotland's finance secretary will not pass on a tax break for higher earners that was announced by the chancellor in his UK budget. The SNP is a minority administration, so Mr Mackay needs some help to get his plans through the final vote, which should take place next February. The Scottish Greens have been his partners for the past two years but they are making threatening noises this year by saying they won't even enter formal negotiations until they see movement towards major reform of local government funding. The Lib Dems, who are normally at least in the conversation, have pulled out of talks altogether after their demand that the SNP step away from any plans for a new independence referendum. For similar constitutional reasons, a deal with Labour or the Conservatives looks vanishingly unlikely. This leaves the Greens in a strong position to make demands - and they have set their sights on scrapping the council tax in favour of ""a fairer system that protects services and cuts inequality"". What can Mr Mackay do to provide the ""meaningful progress"" on this front that Patrick Harvie is looking for? Will the tourist tax be enough, or is he going to have to move further? Expect the real horse-trading to begin in earnest between this announcement and the first votes on the budget bill in the new year. The independent economic forecaster, the Scottish Fiscal Commission, has producedforecasts on economic growth,externalfor the coming years and is predicting economic growth of 1.4% this year and 1.2% in 2019, which it says reflects ""stronger recent economic performance, a more positive prospect for earnings over the next few years"". The Commission forecasts that Â£15.2bn of the Scottish Budget will be raised by devolved taxes in 2019-20. Income tax raises the most revenue, forecast to be Â£11.7bn in the next financial year. Healthwas the big winner with the Scottish Government proposing an increase of almost Â£730m in health and care services, with much of the money being passed on in so-called ""Barnett consequentials"" from Westminster as a result of spending commitments by the UK government south of the border. Educationspending saw a real-terms increase including a Â£180m pot to raise standards in schools. Almost Â£500m has also been committed to aid the expansion of the early learning and childcare sector. Support forbusinesscomes in the shape of Â£5bn commitment for capital investment to be spent on modernising Scotland's infrastructure, including a new Â£50m fund for regenerating run down high streets. Initial funding of Â£130 million towards the establishment of a Scottish National Investment Bank has also been earmarked. Public sector payincreases of 3% for those earning up to Â£36,500 have also been proposed, while those who earn between Â£36,500 and Â£80,000 will see their wages increase by 2%. Separate to the draft budget, it has been announced that MSPs will receive a 2.3% increase taking their salaries to Â£63,579. Mr Mackay also said Scotland's 32local councilswill receive a real terms increase in both revenue and capital funding, taking the local government budget to Â£11.1bn. The Scottish government has also committed more cash to the Â£2.9bnjusticebudget, claiming the police resource budget will be protected in real terms. Income tax- anew five-band regimecame into force earlier this year and the finance secretary has decided to maintain the current rates. He will increase the starter and basic rate thresholds by inflation in a move designed to help the lowest paid. However, the Scottish higher rate threshold has been frozen - unlike in the rest of the UK where the threshold will go up to Â£50,000 from April next year - which Mr Mackay said would raise an extra Â£68m in revenue. The move means the divergence between the income tax regime in Scotland and the rest of the UK continues to grow.  Other taxes Elsewhere, the replacement system for stamp duty in Scotland (Land and Buildings Transaction Tax) is also being revamped with the amount that buy-to-let investors or holiday home buyers pay on a second residential purchase going up from 3% to 4%. The Scottish government's Small Business Bonus Scheme is maintained, while the non-domestic poundage rates paid by businesses will see a"" below-inflation increase"". Local authorities will once again be allowed to increase council tax levels by up to 3%. According to the Scottish Parliament  this is the first year that the new budget
process applies, hereâs a quick overview explainer of the committee / chamber
process... Now the Scottish government has published the Scottish budget, which will include a summary of how the Parliamentâs
committees have influenced the formulation of the budget. Ministers will now provide a more detailed response to individual committeesâ pre budget
reports withinfive sitting daysfrom the publication of the
Budget. Each committee will then have the opportunity to hear oral
evidence from their respective ministers on the detailed response. Committees and individual members will have the opportunity to propose alternative revenue and spending proposals through reasoned amendments to the Scottish government motion on the general principles of the Bill. If ministers do not intend to lodge formal amendments to reflect any reasoned amendments agreed by the Scottish Parliament at Stage 1 then they must provide a written explanation to the Finance and Constitution Committee in advance of Stage 2. Prior to the Stage 1 debate on the Budget Bill, there will be a debate in the Chamber on the committee pre-budget reports and the response of Ministers in the Budget. The debate will be led by the Finance and Constitution Committee and time will be provided during the debate for each relevant convener to set out how their committee has sought to influence the budget and to allow the Government an opportunity to respond. This debate will take place on24 January 2019. The Stage 1 Debate on the Budget Bill will take placew/c 28 January 2019. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokesman for the universities and colleges union, the UCU, said: ""This is a deeply disappointing budget for Scottish higher education. Today's real terms cut to the sector's funding will ultimately hit students the hardest.  If we value our universities and the teaching, knowledge exchange and research they provide, then we needed a funding settlement to match the politicians' warm words."" Mike Kirby, Unison's Scotland secretary, said: ""Today's Scottish government budget fails to make the investment in public services that our country needs. The Scottish government should have taken advantage of their tax powers to maintain essential public services. Instead they have further cut business tax and maintained the failed small business bonus scheme. The rise in local government funding is less than both Cosla and Audit Scotland say is necessary to maintain vital public services."" Allow Twitter content?

Finance Secretary Derek Mackay Finance Secretary Derek Mackay set out his tax and spending plans for the next financial year. Mr MacKay said his budget would protect Scotland from the worst effects of Brexit, but critics said it had ignored business pleas not to increase the income tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK. He said his budget would invest record sums in the health service, there's extra money for childcare, and education funding is protected. Also announced were a real terms cut in business rates, more affordable homes and extra apprenticeship places. On tax, lower income thresholds will increase by inflation, while higher thresholds will be frozen. The finance secretary says that means 99% of taxpayers will pay less tax than they do on their current income. But the Conservatives complained that the increased tax gap with England would damage business growth, and Labour argued the budget doesn't do enough to help children in poverty. MSPs will vote on the plans at the end of January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Young's best-known songs include Cinnamon Girl, Rockin' In The Free World and Heart of Gold Neil Young says he'll go ahead with a show in London's Hyde Park next year - but it will no longer be part of the Barclaycard-sponsored BST festival. The star had previously criticised BST organisers for choosing a ""fossil fuel funding entity"" as a sponsor. ""That doesn't work for me,"" he said in a subsequently-deleted website post. ""I believe in science. I worry about the climate crisis and am deeply concerned about its massive global ramifications."" Although he stopped short of cancelling the shows, he said ""one option"" would be to replace the sponsor. On Tuesday, he appeared to claim victory in aseparate post,external, saying he was ""happy to announce that the Hyde park show will proceed without Barclays as a sponsor"". ""We are overjoyed, so happy to be playing the show!"" Later in the day, BST organisers said in a statement: ""Neil Young has made the decision to move away from the Barclaycard presents British Summer Time concert series. ""Neil Young and Bob Dylan will play a stand-alone concert in Hyde Park on the same date, 12 July. All tickets will remain valid."" Barclaycard told the BBC it would not comment on the situation. Other BST gigs, including dates by Robbie Williams and Florence + The Machine, will not be affected. Barclays was listed as a major funder of fossil fuel extraction in a2018 report,externalby the non-profit group Banking on Climate Change, receiving a ""D+"" rating. Earlier this year, the bank's AGM wasdisrupted by protestors,externalcritical of its funding for oil pipelines from Canadian tar sands. Barclaycard, a division of Barclays that provides credit card and payment services, has sponsored the BST Hyde Park concerts since their inception in 2013, with headline acts including The Rolling Stones, Taylor Swift and Tom Petty. Young also played the festival in 2014 with his band Crazy Horse, apparently without objection to the bank's involvement. On Sunday, the star aired a number of grievances about his upcoming concert, claiming it was announced prematurely, and objecting to the fact that tickets were put on sale to the public ahead of his fans. ""I had no idea the announcement was coming that day,"" he wrote. ""I was still finessing the art for the poster and trying to make sure that all of the details of the show were agreeable to me. ""Then, suddenly, someone jumped the gun. The tickets were put on sale and the announcement was made, all without my knowledge."" The post included lyrics from Young's 1988 anti-corporate sponsorship song This Note's For You: ""I ain't singing for Pepsi / Don't sing for Coke / I won't sing for nobody / Makes me look like a joke."" Fittingly, the post announcing Barclaycard's withdrawal from the event was headlined ""Sponsored By Nobody"".

"Geraint Thomas (in yellow) celebrates winning the 2018 Tour de France with his Team Sky team-mates The future of Team Sky, which has delivered Tour de France wins for Britons Sir Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas, is in doubt after broadcaster Sky announced it will withdraw backing at the end of 2019. Team Sky was launched in January 2010 and has since amassed 322 victories, including eight Grand Tour successes. ""Team Sky will continue to race under a different name if a new backer is secured to provide funding from the beginning of 2020,"" said a Team Sky statement. Wiggins has left the Team Sky set-up to establish his own team after retiring as a rider, but Froome and Thomas are still part of its roster, with reigning Tour champion Thomas signinga new three-year deal with Team Sky in September. Graham McWilliam, chairman of Team Sky, said it was ""the right time"" to bring the broadcaster's involvement with the cycling team to an end and it had been ""our decision"". ""It's been a pleasure and a privilege to have been on the journey with Team Sky and British Cycling right from the start. Priority now is to help find new partners to take the team into the future,""he added.,external I am 100% not a cheat - Wiggins Team Sky 'crossed ethical line' UCI drop Froome case 'A devastating blow to the biggest of reputations' BBC sports editor Dan Roan This marks the beginning of the end of an era of both success and scandal. Thanks to unmatched levels of financial support from their main backer, Team Sky have come to dominate their sport in recent years. While they will be missed by their fans, others in the sport will no doubt feel this finally gives other teams a chance to compete and is healthy for cycling. But as well as being arguably the most successful current professional team in British sport, they are also the most controversial. Sky sources tell me that the decision - taken by chief executive Jeremy Darroch - was part of a natural review of commercial partnerships after the Â£30bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster by media giant Comcast and not to do with the string of high-profile controversies that so damaged the team's reputation in recent years. But it is only a few months since a scathing report by a parliamentary committee concluded that Team Sky had ""crossed the ethical line"" over their use of medical exemptions for banned drugs. The team denied this, but the intrigue surrounding a mystery Jiffy bag - a medical delivery to Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011; the inconsistencies in Sky's explanations, and the absence of medical records at a team that was known for attention to detail and 'marginal gains', were further devastating blows. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was cleared of any wrongdoing in the case of his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol, but the saga did further damage to the team's standing. On the one hand, the timing is intriguing. Geraint Thomas' maiden Tour de France win was regarded as a timely PR boost after so much controversy and thoughts will now turn to the riders and staff, all of whom face an uncertain future. But there is more controversy to come. In February, the man at the very centre of the Jiffy bag scandal - ex-Team Sky chief medic Dr Richard Freeman - has a General Medical Council hearing when he will be asked to explain a mystery delivery of testosterone to the velodrome in 2011. Maybe Sky had simply had enough of the negative headlines, despite so many wins. This video can not be played July 2018: Former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Freeman - We never crossed the line Promising 21-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal, whose performance in this year's Tour de France marked him out as a potential Grand Tour contender,signed a new five-year deal in October. ""While Sky will be moving on at the end of next year, the team is open minded about the future and the potential of working with a new partner, should the right opportunity present itself,"" said team principal Sir Dave Brailsford. ""We aren't finished yet by any means. There is another exciting year of racing ahead of us and we will be doing everything we can to deliver more Team Sky success in 2019."" Team Sky's ambitionto become the first team to win the Tour de France,externalwith a British rider was seen as hugely ambitious when they launched.

However, the efficient but unspectacular style and big spending that has underpinned their stranglehold has proved unpopular with some fans, particularly in France. The team has also been subject to allegations of cheating. Froome, a four-time Tour winner with Sky, had an anti-doping case brought against him andsubsequently dropped by the UCI,while Wiggins has faced questions over his use ofa medical exemption for hayfever medication. TheUK Anti-Doping Agency conducted a 14-month investigationinto a 'mystery package' delivered to then-team doctor Richard Freeman on the final day of Wiggins' successful Criterium du Dauphine bid in 2011. Team Sky, Froome and Wiggins deny any wrongdoing in all three cases. US cable giant Comcast completed a Â£30bn takeover of Sky earlier this year,ousting Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Fox, who owned a minority stake in Team Sky, will also end their involvement in the team from the end of 2019. Some spectators jeered Team Sky at the 2018 Tour de France presentation event BBC chief sports writer Tom Fordyce This was news that neither principal Sir Dave Brailsford nor his riders saw coming, and it leaves a team that has dominated men's road racing facing the most uncertain of futures. The size of Sky's sponsorship over the past eight seasons transformed the balance of power in professional cycling. When Brailsford announced at the team's inception that there would be a British winner of the Tour de France it seemed an impossibility. They instead went on to win six of the last seven yellow jerseys, their budget larger than any of their rivals, their roster strong enough to feature riders in support roles who were good enough to lead many other teams. But it was a relationship always underpinned by the love that James Murdoch - former chief executive of Sky plc and 21st Century Fox - discovered for cycling mid-way through his life, the classic Mamil (middle-aged man in lycra) given an entire team to play with rather than simply a new bike. Murdoch was always hands-on. He was texting Brailsford constantly from the US as Chris Froome pulled off his remarkable late coup on stage 19 on this year's Giro d'Italia, the only of one of cycling's three Grand Tours that Sky had not won coming into 2018. The impetus for the team's jerseys featuring an anti-plastics campaign last season came from Murdoch's wife Kathryn, as did the design for the black orca that figured on the back of the white kit. When Murdoch resigned from 21st Century Fox after Sky were taken over by US giants Comcast, a critical link in the chain had been removed. This is not necessarily the end for the team. Team sponsorships in cycling change frequently. While the size of Sky's investment may be been unprecedented, their length of tenure was unusual too. But finding a sponsor willing to match that financial commitment, at a time of significant financial stress on British companies and after a string of controversies about some of Sky's practices, will perhaps be Brailsford's biggest challenge yet.

"This video can not be played Froome, Brailsford and Thomas react to Sky's sponsorship withdrawal Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome says Team Sky will ""be doing everything we can"" to survive once their owner and main sponsor pulls out at the end of 2019. Broadcaster Skyannounced earlier on Wednesdaythat it would end its decade-long commitment after next season. ""I can't predict the future, but this is a really special team,"" said Froome, who won the Giro d'Italia in May. ""We plan to be together in 2020 if at all possible."" The British rider added: ""We will all be doing everything we can to help make that happen - in different colours with a new partner, but with the same values, focus and desire to win."" Sky to end backing in 2019 Other riders on Team Sky's books include reigning Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, Colombian prospect Egan Bernal, Dutchman Wout Poels, England's Ian Stannard and Wales' Luke Rowe. In an open letter to fans, the team admitted their future was in doubt. ""If we can find a new long-term partner to take the team forward into a new era, then we will do so,""it read.,external ""Equally, any future partner would have to be the right partner - one who shares our ethos and buys in to our values."" Froome, whose contract with Team Sky runs until the end of the 2020 season, paid tribute to the team's current backers. When they were launched in 2010, Team Sky's ambition of delivering a first British Tour de France winner by 2015 was seen as ambitious. They achieved that goal three years ahead of schedule thanks to Sir Bradley Wiggins' 2012 success. Between him, Froome and Thomas, Team Sky have won the yellow jersey in six of the past seven races. Speaking to BBC Sport from a training camp in Mallorca, Froome said he had only been told the news on Tuesday evening. ""Naturally we were all surprised to hear the news,"" he said. ""But at the same time we've got to remain optimistic and not lose focus on what we're trying to do. ""We've got big goals next year to win a lot of bike races. My target will be on the Tour de France and I've got every confidence if we can have a season next year that's similar to previous seasons, we'll be able to find another sponsor."" Froome said he did not think the decision would impact on his chances of winning a fifth Tour de France title. ""Nothing's changing in the team right now. We've got one more year to race and I think, if anything, it's given us even more motivation to go out and have the best season possible next year."" Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford claimed Sky's withdrawal was a ""new opportunity"" and a ""natural"" decision after 10 years in the sport. ""We know in life things change. When things do change you stay calm, bring the group together, stay strong and look for opportunities. Go out there with energy and excitement and build something new,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I like to build things, I'm an optimist."" Brailsford said he'd like Team Sky to be remembered for its ""impact on participation"", ""winning a lot"" and being a ""really high performing team"" that ""set high standards"". He also said he had already received calls ""expressing interest"", adding the future ""looks very good"" and said he takes his ""responsibility very seriously"" to make sure the team have a ""secure future"". Asked about the reaction to the news from Froome and Thomas he said it had been ""absolute class"" and showed why they are ""big champions on and off the bike"". Geraint Thomas signed a new deal with Team Sky after winning his maiden Tour de France title this year Thomas confirmed the possibility of Sky ending their sponsorship was not raised during his contract renewal talks, with the Welshman havingsigned a new three-year deal in September. He said the news was a ""shock"" and ""disappointing"" but that he was ""excited"" for the future direction of the team. ""It's been an incredible nine years so far and we want to go out on a high and make 2019 the last and the best year yet,"" he told BBC Sport. ""We're still confident in Dave and the team that they can continue and keep the team together. ""A lot of other teams have lost title sponsors but have continued - Movistar has been going for over 30 years with different sponsors. ""It's certainly not the end, or at least hopefully it's not the end, so it's also kind of exciting at the same time. It just gives everyone a bit more motivation to keep pushing on.""

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford, photographed by a Labour AM sat in the assembly, said the political skies had ""darkened"" Mark Drakeford has been confirmed as the new first minister after a vote in the Welsh Assembly. The Welsh Labour leader succeeds Carwyn Jones, who resigned yesterday. Mr Drakeford was backed by 30 AMs, versus 12 for the Conservatives' Paul Davies and nine for Plaid Cymru's Adam Price. The AM for Cardiff West and former finance minister said that in a ""fractured world"" AMs should strive for ""a kinder sort of politics"". He said the assembly should be a ""beacon of hope"". Who is Mark Drakeford? Drakeford wins Welsh Labour contest The Queen is expected to endorse his appointment in the next 24 hours. Mr Drakeford will then need to be sworn in by a senior judge before he can officially take up office. Accepting his nomination for the job, Mr Drakeford referred to theno confidence vote Theresa May faces laterfrom Conservative MPs. Mark Drakeford was confirmed as first minister after he won the Welsh Labour leadership contest, which finished last week ""When I was elected as the leader of the Labour Party last week I said that I wanted to be a beacon of hope in a darkening world,"" he said. ""Today is not a moment for partisan remarks, but the skies around us has darkened even further in the days that have followed. ""A species of madness has descended on the Conservative Party, in which a significant number of MPs appear to believe that our country's future is best secured by heaping a leadership contest on to the burning platform that Brexit has become."" He urged AMs to make sure their actions would ""make a difference in a fractured and uneasy world"". Carwyn Jones bows out as first minister Jones's legacy as first minister Mr Drakeford added: ""It is an enormous privilege to lead a political party here in Wales, and even more so be nominated and elected as first minister in the National Assembly. I am absolutely conscious both of the opportunity and the responsibility which comes with this position."" Kirsty Williams will continue as Welsh education secretary Mr Drakeford was nominated for the job by his predecessor first minister Carwyn Jones, now sat on the backbenches. In a roll call vote, Labour AMs, Liberal Democrat AM Kirsty Williams and independent AM Dafydd Elis-Thomas all backed him. The two largest opposition parties - the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru - nominated their own leaders for the job while UKIP abstained. Following the vote, it was confirmed that Ms Williams will remain in her role as education secretary in Mr Drakeford's cabinet following an agreement with the new Welsh Labour leader. ""This agreement allows us to build on our achievements over the last two years and to continue on our national mission of raising standards, reducing the attainment gap, and delivering an education system that is a source of national pride and public confidence,"" she said. Mark Drakeford was applauded by Labour AMs after he was confirmed as the new first In his debut speech as first minister, Mark Drakeford didn't talk about the nitty-gritty of delivering public services. Instead, he set his sights on offering a ""kinder sort of politics"" and talked about his ambition to be a ""beacon of hope"". It wasn't a time for partisan politics, he said... before quickly piling into the Tories over Brexit and their leadership machinations in Westminster. As a former government adviser and then a cabinet minister, Mr Drakeford has had a long apprenticeship. He'll hope to put his own stamp on the Welsh Government after nine years under Carwyn Jones's leadership. But like Mr Jones's own acceptance speech nine years ago, Mr Drakeford paid tribute to their predecessor, Rhodri Morgan.

"Young's best-known songs include Cinnamon Girl, Rockin' In The Free World and Heart of Gold Neil Young says he'll go ahead with a show in London's Hyde Park next year - but it will no longer be part of the Barclaycard-sponsored BST festival. The star had previously criticised BST organisers for choosing a ""fossil fuel funding entity"" as a sponsor. ""That doesn't work for me,"" he said in a subsequently-deleted website post. ""I believe in science. I worry about the climate crisis and am deeply concerned about its massive global ramifications."" Although he stopped short of cancelling the shows, he said ""one option"" would be to replace the sponsor. On Tuesday, he appeared to claim victory in aseparate post,external, saying he was ""happy to announce that the Hyde park show will proceed without Barclays as a sponsor"". ""We are overjoyed, so happy to be playing the show!"" Later in the day, BST organisers said in a statement: ""Neil Young has made the decision to move away from the Barclaycard presents British Summer Time concert series. ""Neil Young and Bob Dylan will play a stand-alone concert in Hyde Park on the same date, 12 July. All tickets will remain valid."" Barclaycard told the BBC it would not comment on the situation. Other BST gigs, including dates by Robbie Williams and Florence + The Machine, will not be affected. Barclays was listed as a major funder of fossil fuel extraction in a2018 report,externalby the non-profit group Banking on Climate Change, receiving a ""D+"" rating. Earlier this year, the bank's AGM wasdisrupted by protestors,externalcritical of its funding for oil pipelines from Canadian tar sands. Barclaycard, a division of Barclays that provides credit card and payment services, has sponsored the BST Hyde Park concerts since their inception in 2013, with headline acts including The Rolling Stones, Taylor Swift and Tom Petty. Young also played the festival in 2014 with his band Crazy Horse, apparently without objection to the bank's involvement. On Sunday, the star aired a number of grievances about his upcoming concert, claiming it was announced prematurely, and objecting to the fact that tickets were put on sale to the public ahead of his fans. ""I had no idea the announcement was coming that day,"" he wrote. ""I was still finessing the art for the poster and trying to make sure that all of the details of the show were agreeable to me. ""Then, suddenly, someone jumped the gun. The tickets were put on sale and the announcement was made, all without my knowledge."" The post included lyrics from Young's 1988 anti-corporate sponsorship song This Note's For You: ""I ain't singing for Pepsi / Don't sing for Coke / I won't sing for nobody / Makes me look like a joke.""

"One in eight homes had download speeds below 5Mbps, according to uSwitch A village street in Bamfurlong, Gloucestershire, has been named as the slowest for broadband internet, according to an annual survey. The study said homes on Greenmeadows Park averaged just 0.14 megabits per second (Mbps). The fastest spot, by contrast, is said to offer speeds that are nearly 1,900 times faster. It was named as Abdon Avenue in Birmingham, where the average speed was recorded as being 265.89Mbps. For the sake of comparison, those figures suggest it would take users five minutes 42 seconds to download all five episodes of Sir David Attenborough's Dynasties series in high definition in Abdon Avenue, but more than seven days in Greenmeadows Park. Of note, the Gloucestershire street is only about one mile (1.6km) away from GCHQ, the communications-focussed intelligence agency, which has some of the fastest internet access of all. The research was carried out by the price comparison service uSwitch, which said it was based on more than 279,000 real-world speed tests by members of the public. However, the team behind a rival service has criticised the company's methodology, and it appears that Greenmeadows Park's residents do have access to much faster speeds. The government has promised homes and businesseswill have a legal right to a minimum of 10Mbps from 2020. USwitch said its results suggested the average speed in the UK was now 46.2Mbps, but added that about 13% of homes had speeds below 5Mbps. Five of the country's fastest streets were found to be in the South West - in Devon, Dorset, Cornwall and Wiltshire. Meanwhile, nine of the slowest streets were said to be in areas north of the River Mersey - including North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Scotland. In some cases the firm said it was a ""postcode lottery"" as to whether users had abnormally fast or slow access, but in others it said there were ways to get a better service, such as moving to a ""full-fibre"" connection. ""Over a third of the slowest streets have access to superfast speeds, so people living there have no need to be crawling along on completely unusable internet services,"" said spokeswoman Dani Warner. Greenmeadows Park residents may be among those who are unaware of the choices on offer. A property on sale in the street is currently advertised as offering speeds of ""up to 2Mbps"", while BT's own speed-checker claims they stretch ""up to 3.5Mbps"". But Gloucestershire County Council has tweeted that the rural broadband provider Gigaclear also offers an ""ultrafast"" gigabit service. Allow Twitter content?

"Michael Barrymore was arrested on suspicion of the rape and murder of Stuart Lubbock in 2007 Entertainer Michael Barrymore will receive only nominal damages from Essex Police after an unlawful arrest which he claimed had ""destroyed his career"". The comedian and TV presenter had hoped for a payout of more than Â£2.4m from the force in relation to his 2007 wrongful arrest on suspicion of the rape and murder of Stuart Lubbock. Essex Police challenged the amount it owed him and has won its appeal. This Court of Appeal ruling overturns the 2017 High Court ruling. Three judges ruled in London earlier that 66-year-old Mr Barrymore was ""entitled to nominal damages only"", despite his lawyer claiming the arrest had produced a ""devastating"" effect on his career. Further hearings are expected to decide the final amount of compensation Mr Barrymore will receive and Essex Police has said it will seek costs from the entertainer. Mr Barrymore previously brought legal action against the police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment under his real name, Michael Ciaran Parker, claiming that he was owed millions of pounds in compensation for lost earnings. Barrymore judge rules against police Barrymore wins payout over wrongful arrest How the British TV king lost his crown Mr Lubbock was found dead in the entertainer's swimming pool in 2001 The star was detained in relation to Mr Lubbock's death after the 31-year-old's body was found in Mr Barrymore's swimming pool at his home in Roydon, Essex, in 2001. He was arrested alongside two other men but no charges were ever brought. The arrest was unlawful because the arresting officer did not have reasonable grounds to suspect Mr Barrymore, a high court judge Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said in August 2017. An officer who could have legally detained the starwas stuck in trafficat the time. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Mr Lubbock died Essex Police said in a statement: ""The Court of Appeal has today confirmed that had a different procedure been followed on 14 June 2007 the arrest of Mr Parker would have been lawful and have declared that only nominal damages are paid by the force."" It also said the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death remained open and that its thoughts were with his family.

"""Meghan Markle"" was the most searched-for person's name for the second year running on Google's UK search service. But the Duchess of Sussex came second to the overall winner of the most queried term - ""World Cup"" - in the company's search trends review for 2018. ""Royal wedding"" and ""royal baby"" were the top two news event trends. The duchess announced her first pregnancyin Octoberwhile on tour with Prince Harry in Australia. Of course, there were two royal weddings this year: Prince Harry and Meghan Marklein May; and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbankin October, which may have added to the overall figures. ""Roxanne Pallett"" the former Emmerdale actor who courted controversy on Celebrity Big Brother after accusing housemate Ryan Thomas of punching her, came second in most-searched-for celebrities. Pallett ended up quitting herradio showon York-based Minster FM over the fallout from the incident, calling herself ""the most hated girl in Britain"". Celebrities who struggled with substance abuse took the third and fourth spots: ""Demi Lovato"", who hadan apparent overdose, and ""Ant McPartlin"", who had well-documented struggles with rehab and recovery. McPartlin took time off from his TV presenting roles including ITV's I'm a Celebrity - which was the top trending TV Show - aftercrashing his carwhile under the influence of alcohol. Despite being the most watched television drama last year, ""Bodyguard"" was pipped to the post by ""Killing Eve"" - numbers three and two respectively in the television category. Marvel's superhero film Black Panther was the fourth top trending overall query as well as being the most searched for movie title. It was the studio's first film to focus on Africa and feature a predominantly black cast. Black Panther was also one of thehighest grossing movies of the year, taking more than $1bn (Â£800m) worldwide. Among the more prosaic searches in the ""How To...?"" list were ""How to bleed radiators?"" at number eight and ""How to put lights on a Christmas tree?"" at number nine. Perhaps reflecting wider privacy concerns on social media, ""How to delete Instagram?"" and ""How to delete Facebook?"" were fifth and sixth on the list. Jeremy Clarkson's return to prime-time TV with a classic moment on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" made it into the most searched trends. The show introduced an ""Ask the Host"" lifeline to its Phone a Friend, 50/50 and Ask The Audience options. Clarkson gave a confident answer to ""What is an Ibex?"" leading to a flurry of searches for the wild goat. Unfortunately he said it was a deer and lost his contestant Â£15,000. Finishing ahead of this gaffe ""What is Bitcoin?"" topped the list of quizzical searches. Considering the wild price fluctuations and opaque nature of how the crypto-currency works, it does not come as a surprise. Heads were also scratched over ""What is GDPR"" the new European Union legislation on data protection which made second spot on the What is? list.

"Government guidance says services should develop evacuation plans The second phase of the Grenfell Tower inquiry is unlikely to start until the end of 2019, the chairman has said. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said there were some 200,000 documents still to disclose which would not be done before next autumn, more than two years after the fire which killed 72 people. The first phase, which concludes this week, centred on the night of the fire - the second will examine wider issues. Earlier, the inquiry heard the fire service had no tower evacuation plans. The Fire Brigades Union said Britain's fire services had no strategy for evacuating a high-rise building at the time of the Grenfell disaster. This was despitegovernment guidelines,externalwhich recommended contingency plans in case services needed to abandon the standard ""stay put"" advice. On the night of the fire at the tower block in North Kensington, west London, a policy of ""stay put"" was kept in place for around two hours after the blaze broke out. Both firefighters on the ground and in control rooms told residents they should remain in their flats. Governmentguidance published in 2014 says fire services should develop evacuation plans,externalfor when the standard ""stay put"" advice becomes ""untenable"". Sir Martin, the retired appeal court judge who is chairing the inquiry, will consider whether evacuating the building earlier could have saved lives. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Martin Seaward, the FBU's barrister, told the inquiry that developing practical drills for an evacuation plan would have been ""a major undertaking achievable only at the national level"". It would be ""too daunting"" even for a large fire service like London's, he said. Firefighters have previously given evidence that evacuations in such circumstances were not something they were trained to do. ""The incident commander was placed in an impossible position without an evacuation procedure in place,"" Mr Seaward said. He added that he hoped the inquiry would next consider why evacuation plans hadn't been developed. Before the Grenfell fire there had been a series of well-known smaller fires which spread rapidly, Mr Seaward told the inquiry. But he said procedures and training were not drawn up as a result. On Monday, a lawyer for the victimstold the inquirythat London Fire Brigade's leaders had let down residents and firefighters. The first phase of the inquiry's hearings - which ended on Wednesday - concentrated solely on the events of the night of 14 June 2017. The second phase will examine the refurbishment of the tower and concerns expressed by residents about fire safety. Sir Martin said that ""if all goes well"" the second half of the inquiry would take place closer to the tower in west London, after survivors and the bereaved struggled to get to the current central London venue. He said work had begun to digest 200,000 documents relating to the refurbishment, including the installation of cladding and insulation, which would ""tell much of the story"" of what went wrong.

"Meng Wanzhou has said she will contest allegations of fraud Donald Trump says he could intervene in the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou if it helps to avoid a further decline in US relations with China. ""Whatever's good for this country, I would do,"" the US president said. Ms Meng, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant, was granted bail on Tuesday by a Canadian court. She was arrested on 1 December and could be extradited to the US to face fraud charges linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran. Ms Meng, 46, denies any wrongdoing and has said she will contest the allegations. She is the daughter of Huawei's founder and her detention, which comes amid an increasingly acrimonious trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, has angered China and soured its relations with both Canada and the US. Why Huawei matters in five charts What's going on with Huawei? Canada seeks access to China-held citizen In an interview with Reuters news agency on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he would intervene in the US Justice Department's case against Ms Meng if it would serve national security interests or help achieve a trade deal with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made - which is a very important thing - what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" he said. A Canadian official, speaking on background on Wednesday, told journalists that it would be difficult this early in the proceedings to evaluate whether Mr Trump's comment could have an impact on the extradition case. But he said that ""it is certainly something that Ms Meng's counsel could raise"". Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told journalists in Ottawa that parties seeking extradition from Canada should ensure the process is not politicised. Justice William Ehrcke in Vancouver set bail for Ms Meng at C$10m (Â£6m; $7.4m). Of that, C$7m must be provided in cash with C$3m in collateral. The judge said that she would be under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. She will be unable to go out between 2300 and 0600 and must surrender all passports and travel documents. In the three-day bail hearing in Vancouver, Ms Meng's lawyers sought to provide guarantees that she would not pose a flight risk if released. The application was opposed by Canadian prosecutors. Supporters of Ms Meng gathered outside the court in Vancouver US prosecutors say Ms Meng used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. They allege she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company from Huawei.  It is also alleged she deceived banks about the true relationship between the two companies. Applause broke out in the courtroom when Justice Ehrcke granted bail. Ms Meng cried and hugged her lawyers. The judge ordered her to reappear in court on 6 February. After the ruling, Huawei issued a statement, saying: ""We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach a just conclusion."" China, which insists that Ms Meng has not violated any laws, had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released the Huawei executive. Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng earlier summoned both the US and Canadian ambassadors and lodged a ""strong protest"" urging her release. The ministry described Ms Meng's arrest as ""extremely nasty"". Ms Meng is chief financial officer of Huawei, the world's second-biggest smartphone maker Separately on Tuesday, it emerged that a Canadian former diplomathad been detained in China. Michael Kovrig's current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was working for his prompt release. There has been no official word from China about his whereabouts. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was in direct contact with Chinese authorities concerning the case. Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Mr Kovrig previously worked as a diplomat in Beijing, Hong Kong and at the UN in New York. Canadian officials said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link between Mr Kovrig's reported detention and the arrest of Ms Meng. Under Canadian law, the federal justice minister has 30 days after receiving a formal request from the US to decide whether to allow an extradition hearing to proceed in court. If a judge is satisfied with the evidence presented during the hearing, he or she will authorise the individual be committed for extradition.  The justice minister then decides whether to surrender them to the US. Ms Meng does have avenues to appeal. She can appeal both the court decision and seek a judicial review of the minister's decision. If the appellate court upholds either decision, an individual may still seek leave to appeal to Canada's Supreme Court. In some rare instances, extradition cases have dragged on for over a decade. In a statement, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she takes her ""extradition responsibilities and obligations very seriously"". Canadian officials say they will ""faithfully follow the rule of law"" in this case. Meng Wanzhou joined Huawei as early as 1993, when she began a career at her father's company as a receptionist. After she graduated with a master's degree in accountancy from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1999, she joined the finance department of Huawei. She became the company's chief finance officer in 2011 and was promoted to vice-chair a few months before her arrest. Ms Meng's links to her father, Ren Zhengfei, were not public knowledge until a few years ago. In a practice highly unusual in Chinese tradition, she adopted her family name not from her father but her mother, Meng Jun, who was Mr Ren's first wife. Timeline: What's going on with Huawei?

"A comedian has turned down a gig at a university after being asked to sign a ""behavioural agreement"" first. Konstantin Kisin was warned about a ""no tolerance policy"" on topics including racism, sexism and transphobia. He was asked to perform at a gig at the School of African and Oriental Studies (SOAS) in London, organised by university society Unicef on Campus. The group has since apologised and the Students' Union says it ""believes fully in freedom of speech"". Konstantin told Radio 1 Newsbeat the experience reflects a growing trend of free speech becoming stifled on university campuses across the UK. He shared the ""behavioural agreement form"" online, saying the title ""nearly made me puke"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I just think it reflects an attitude among a group of people, people at university particularly, where it seems that they have become places of indoctrination rather than learning,"" he said. ""Students are being taught to prevent offence rather than to seek truth and pursue experiences. ""Universities used to be all about that, but now it seems they're places where students are being taught to be woke. I think it reflects a broader issue, where increasingly there are people who value safety, or what they perceive to be safety."" The full list of topics listed by the organisers were ""racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism"". The contract said: ""It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed. But it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way."" Konstantin, who was born in the Soviet Union, says that he's since referenced the experience on stage. ""I was performing at Comedy Unleashed.

""I'm from Russia, I joke aboutNovichokand I joke about the fact that I'm Russian and my wife is Ukrainian -that's a whole big issueright now,"" he says.

I turned down this gig because if you sign a contract like that, you're exposing yourself to someone's bad interpretation.

"Amanda Cox's death is being treated as unexplained Investigations are taking place into the death of a new mother who is thought to have collapsed after getting lost inside Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Amanda Cox, who was 34 and from Peebles in the Borders, was reported missing on Monday after failing to return to the maternity ward following a visit to see her son at the neonatal unit. She was found collapsed at about 22:00 after a five-hour search. Police said her death was being treated as unexplained, but not suspicious. NHS Lothian said it was helping police with their inquiry into the death. Ms Cox's family were not available for comment about her death. A family friend said Ms Cox had been suffering headaches since before the birth of her son, Murray, last Thursday. ""Apparently she was going back to her room for medication but took a wrong turning and came out of the neonatal ward into a disused ward,"" said the friend. The friend added that Murray, who weighed just 3lb 7oz, had been transferred to Edinburgh following his birth in Borders General Hospital. Amanda Cox was discovered collapsed inside Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Monday night In a statement Police Scotland said: ""We can confirm that missing woman Amanda Cox was discovered collapsed within the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary around 10pm on Monday December 10. ""She sadly passed away a short time later."" The statement added: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with Amanda's family and friends at this time."" Jim Crombie, deputy chief executive of NHS Lothian, said the health authority was assisting police with their inquiries. He added: ""My thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Amanda Cox at this sad time."" Local MSP Christine Grahame has sent her condolences to the Cox family and is seeking answers about why it took so long to find Amanda. She said ""This is appalling news. It's a tragedy for the family"" ""How over many hours, not just minutes, many hours this mother went missing in a hospital. ""How there was a search outside the grounds but nobody located her within the hospital. It should never have happened. It's dreadful and it must never happen again.""

"Meng Wanzhou has said she will contest allegations of fraud Donald Trump says he could intervene in the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou if it helps to avoid a further decline in US relations with China. ""Whatever's good for this country, I would do,"" the US president said. Ms Meng, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant, was granted bail on Tuesday by a Canadian court. She was arrested on 1 December and could be extradited to the US to face fraud charges linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran. Ms Meng, 46, denies any wrongdoing and has said she will contest the allegations. She is the daughter of Huawei's founder and her detention, which comes amid an increasingly acrimonious trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, has angered China and soured its relations with both Canada and the US. Why Huawei matters in five charts What's going on with Huawei? Canada seeks access to China-held citizen In an interview with Reuters news agency on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he would intervene in the US Justice Department's case against Ms Meng if it would serve national security interests or help achieve a trade deal with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made - which is a very important thing - what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" he said. A Canadian official, speaking on background on Wednesday, told journalists that it would be difficult this early in the proceedings to evaluate whether Mr Trump's comment could have an impact on the extradition case. But he said that ""it is certainly something that Ms Meng's counsel could raise"". Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told journalists in Ottawa that parties seeking extradition from Canada should ensure the process is not politicised. Justice William Ehrcke in Vancouver set bail for Ms Meng at C$10m (Â£6m; $7.4m). Of that, C$7m must be provided in cash with C$3m in collateral. The judge said that she would be under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. She will be unable to go out between 2300 and 0600 and must surrender all passports and travel documents. In the three-day bail hearing in Vancouver, Ms Meng's lawyers sought to provide guarantees that she would not pose a flight risk if released. The application was opposed by Canadian prosecutors. Supporters of Ms Meng gathered outside the court in Vancouver US prosecutors say Ms Meng used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. They allege she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company from Huawei.  It is also alleged she deceived banks about the true relationship between the two companies. Applause broke out in the courtroom when Justice Ehrcke granted bail. Ms Meng cried and hugged her lawyers. The judge ordered her to reappear in court on 6 February. After the ruling, Huawei issued a statement, saying: ""We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach a just conclusion."" China, which insists that Ms Meng has not violated any laws, had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released the Huawei executive. Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng earlier summoned both the US and Canadian ambassadors and lodged a ""strong protest"" urging her release. The ministry described Ms Meng's arrest as ""extremely nasty"". Ms Meng is chief financial officer of Huawei, the world's second-biggest smartphone maker Separately on Tuesday, it emerged that a Canadian former diplomathad been detained in China. Michael Kovrig's current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was working for his prompt release. There has been no official word from China about his whereabouts. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was in direct contact with Chinese authorities concerning the case. Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Mr Kovrig previously worked as a diplomat in Beijing, Hong Kong and at the UN in New York. Canadian officials said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link between Mr Kovrig's reported detention and the arrest of Ms Meng. Under Canadian law, the federal justice minister has 30 days after receiving a formal request from the US to decide whether to allow an extradition hearing to proceed in court. If a judge is satisfied with the evidence presented during the hearing, he or she will authorise the individual be committed for extradition.  The justice minister then decides whether to surrender them to the US. Ms Meng does have avenues to appeal. She can appeal both the court decision and seek a judicial review of the minister's decision. If the appellate court upholds either decision, an individual may still seek leave to appeal to Canada's Supreme Court. In some rare instances, extradition cases have dragged on for over a decade. In a statement, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she takes her ""extradition responsibilities and obligations very seriously"". Canadian officials say they will ""faithfully follow the rule of law"" in this case. Meng Wanzhou joined Huawei as early as 1993, when she began a career at her father's company as a receptionist. After she graduated with a master's degree in accountancy from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1999, she joined the finance department of Huawei. She became the company's chief finance officer in 2011 and was promoted to vice-chair a few months before her arrest. Ms Meng's links to her father, Ren Zhengfei, were not public knowledge until a few years ago. In a practice highly unusual in Chinese tradition, she adopted her family name not from her father but her mother, Meng Jun, who was Mr Ren's first wife. Timeline: What's going on with Huawei?

"Women are awarded prizes at a ceremony in the afternoon but not at the evening dinner Women in farming have called on a men-only awards dinner ""to get with the times"" and allow them to attend. The Dartmouth Fatstock Show in Devon, which sees farmers compete for the best cattle, sheep and poultry, has run for more than 100 years. Show chairman, Phil Bond, said the men-only evening dinner was ""a tradition and how it has always been done"". Farmer Chloe Quantick said: ""They need to stop being a bit sexist and let us in there."" The current system sees prizes distributed to men and women at an afternoon ceremony, before the men's awards are presented for a second time at a hotel dinner. This year's event took place on Tuesday. Debbie Morris was told a man would have to represent her at the show when she was mayor of Dartmouth More Devon news The show committee recently held a vote and decided to maintain the exclusion of women - one farmer resigned in protest and said his pleas for change were ""shouted down"". Mr Bond said: ""That's the tradition, that's the way it always has been done. I've got the support and the backing from the committee to carry on. ""If in the future that changes as a democracy or as a vote within the committee that will carry on."" He said he believed ""ladies are really not bothered"" and he would rather keep out of the ""petty argument of it all"". M&S knickers display 'vomit-inducing' DJ sorry for Ballon d'Or 'twerk' question 'Girls don't feel safe walking home alone' The Dartmouth Young Farmers Association currently has more female than male members, and there are four women on the show committee of 17. Jessica Perry, a committee member, said the female ban was ""very outdated now"". ""It would be nice if we could move with the 21st Century,"" she said. ""But that's something that as a group and as a committee the Fatstock show will have to discuss and hopefully move with the times."" This video can not be played Fatstock show chairman Phil Bond says women are 'not bothered' about a men-only dinner Ms Quantick, who won two championships at this year's show, said: ""I think they should get with modern times and let the women come. ""They need to stop being a bit sexist and let us in there, because we can have a good laugh just as much as men can, so in my opinion we should be allowed to go."" Debbie Morris said there was no exception to the rule even when she was mayor of Dartmouth, when she was told a male representative would have to attend in her place.

"A majority of Tory MPs have said they want Boris Johnson to remain party leader and prime minister. But critics suggest his authority has been undermined and he still faces challenges to keep his job. All 359 Conservative MPs took part in the vote. Mr Johnson received the support of 211 of them, with 148 voting against him. The result means Mr Johnson was supported by 59% of his MPs. As the ballot was held in secret, Tory MPs don't have to say how they voted, but some have chosen to do so. The PM will know his opponents are not defeated Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to have been challenged. Theresa May: In a vote over her Brexit policy, Mrs May survived a confidence vote witha majority of 83 in December 2018. Despite winning, she resigned as PM six months later Iain Duncan Smith:Following months of speculation the Tory leadernarrowly lost a confidence vote in October 2003,externaland resigned John Major:Triggered a contest in 1995 byresigning as leader of the Tory party(though not as prime minister) amid disagreements inside the party over Europe. Mr Major beat challenger John Redwood, but went on to lose the 1997 election Margaret Thatcher:Resigned as PM in 1990 afterfailing to win outright victory for party leadership,external. She beat Michael Heseltine by 204 votes to 152, but was persuaded to stand down by her Cabinet Having survived, Mr Johnson can continue as Conservative Party leader and therefore prime minister. However, by-elections to pick new MPs in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton will be held on 23 June. If they are taken by opposition parties, Mr Johnson could find himself under renewed pressure. Although Mr Johnson won the vote, MPs could still consider options to try to remove him: Change the rules At present, Conservative MPs will not be allowed to hold another confidence vote for a year. However, there has been speculation the rules could be changed, in order to hold another vote sooner. When asked about it, Sir Graham Brady MP - the chairman of a group called the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory backbenchers - said ""technically, it's possible"". Cabinet pressure The Cabinet - made up senior members of the government - could put political pressure on the PM to resign. This happened toMargaret Thatcher in 1990,external, despite having defeated Michael Heseltine who had challenged for the leadership. A far less likely route would be for the Cabinet to go the Queen and declare they don't have confidence in the PM. However, this ""would drag the Queen into a very difficult position"" says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government. Motion of no confidence in the prime minister A confidence vote where all MPs - not just Conservatives - get to vote has been proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. The government is very unlikely to make time in Parliament to hold such a vote, according to Ms Haddon. However, if the leader of the opposition - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time. It would need just one more MP to vote in favour than the number voting against in order to pass. However, Tory MPs are very unlikely to go down this path says Ms Haddon: ""They would only use this mechanism as a last resort if they had no other way to dislodge Boris Johnson."" If Mr Johnson stood down, a leadership contest would be triggered. The eventual winner would become prime minister. In order to stand, candidates need the support of eight other Tory MPs. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. in the first round, candidates must get 5% of the votes to stay in the running (18 MPs) in the second round, they must get 10% (36 MPs) in the following rounds, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country - not just MPs - will vote for the winner.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Superdry, best known for its coats and hoodies, has warned of weaker than expected profits, saying shoppers have not bought extra winter layers this year. It now expects annual profits of between Â£55m and Â£70m - analysts had been expecting around Â£84m. The announcement hit Superdry's shares and they closed more than 38% lower. The company is considering closing stores as part of a cost cutting drive to save Â£50m by 2022. ""Superdry had a difficult first half, impacted by unseasonably warm weather across our major markets, a consumer economy that is increasingly discount driven and the issues we are addressing in product mix and range,"" said Euan Sutherland, Superdry's chief executive officer. Underlying profit before tax almost halved in the first half of the year, to Â£12.9m. Superdry founder seeks return to the fold High Street crisis: How do we spend our money? November shopper footfall 'worst since recession' The retailer is a third of the way through an 18-month strategy to re-energise the brand which includes introducing childrenswear and 100% organic cotton products. Mr Sutherland said the firm's ""over-reliance"" on jackets and sweatshirts was partly to blame for flagging sales. He will oversee an efficiency drive which will include reviewing the number and size of their stores, and exploring renegotiating rents between now and March 2019. Superdry's shares were down by as much as 30% on Wednesday. They have lost more than 70% of their value this year. Superdry became popular with teenagers by providing high quality sweatshirts and other casual wear with a Japanese-style branding. However it has been losing ground and was dubbed recently by the Financial Times as a brand ""for cool dads"". ""It is a brand that hit a trend in the UK several years ago,"" said Maria Malone, from the Manchester Fashion Institute. ""Its customers are older, thirty plus, but the website features young models, this confuses the consumer."" The problem is that Superdry's products are neither high fashion nor very functional, and its style, reminiscent of American Classic or Gap, is ubiquitous, Ms Malone said. According to fashion retail analyst, Kate Hardcastle, the brand has saturated the market and has suffered from discount retailers producing copycat versions, ""To stay fashionable and engage with a buyer a brand has to have an air of exclusivity about it,"" she said. Superdry's founder Julian Dunkerton left the board in March. Since then he has criticised the retailer's strategy. He said the company should focus on its core jackets and hoodies and offer a far wider range of variations online: ""Superdry is a series of core products - stick with them and tweak them,"" he said. As part of its new strategy Superdry has launched a ""fast-fashion"" range aimed at a ""younger, more fashion-driven"" customer. The range mimics online retailers in going from design to delivery to consumers in six weeks and is being marketed via social media.

"The Christmas market in Strasbourg attracts thousands of visitors every year A gunman opened fire near a crowded Christmas market in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, in an attack that killed five people. The attack on the evening of 11 December also injured another 11 people, four of whom are still in hospital. The main suspect in the attack, 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, was shot dead by police on the evening of 13 December. Hundreds of officers had been involved in the search for the suspect, who was well known to the authorities for previous criminal offences. The attack began at around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on 11 December close to one of Strasbourg's central squares, place KlÃ©ber. The attacker was seen holding a gun outside 10, rue des OrfÃ¨vres in the centre of the city, prosecutor Remy  Heitz said on Wednesday. He then went around the area, down the following streets in succession: rue des Grandes Arcades, rue du Saumon, rue des Chandelles and rue Sainte-HÃ©lÃ¨ne, before going on to rue du Pont Saint-Martin. Along the way he opened fire several times and also used a knife to seriously wound and kill people, Mr Heitz added, saying the suspect yelled ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) during the rampage. When faced by four soldiers of the anti-terror Sentinelle operation, he fired in their direction. They fired back, wounding him in the arm. He managed to reach a taxi which drove him away from the scene and dropped him in the vicinity of the police station in Neudorf, the area where he lived which sits on the border between Germany and France. The taxi driver, who has spoken to the police, said the man had asked to be taken to that district without giving an address, saying he would guide him there. The driver also said he could see the man had a hand gun and was wounded. To explain the origin of his wounds, the suspect said he had killed 10 people and that he had been injured in a firefight with soldiers. After he got out of the taxi, the gunman came across police officers and exchanged fire with them. This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and attending to a victim of the Strasbourg shooting The suspect also told the driver that a grenade had been found at his home that morning. That allowed investigators to link the man with a police search undertaken earlier on Tuesday. During that operation, which was part of investigations into a robbery and a homicide, police had found a defensive grenade, a loaded rifle and four knives, the prosecutor said. As a result of testimonies from the public, an extensive police operation involving a helicopter was launched on Thursday evening at 19:30 local time (18:30 GMT) in the Neudorf area, where Chekatt was last seen after the attack. At 21:00, Chekatt was spotted in rue du Lazaret by officers in a police car, Mr Heitz said on Friday. The suspect noticed the police car and tried to enter a building at number 74, but could not get in. The officers identified themselves, and he turned around, pointing a gun - similar to the one used in Tuesday's attack - and fired in their direction, hitting their car, Mr Heitz said. Two of the three officers fired back several times and killed the suspect. He was identified through his fingerprints and declared dead at 21:05. The officers found an old gun, still loaded, some ammunition and a knife on his body. Born in Strasbourg in February 1989, Chekatt was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. He is thought to have become radicalised during his time in prison, and was noticed by the relevant authorities in 2015 for that reason. He was placed on the ""fiche S"" watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security, and was being monitored by the DGSI, France's domestic intelligence agency, Mr Heitz said on Wednesday. Seven people were arrested in connection with the attack - four members of his family as well as three other people close to him. However, all but one were freed several days later. Face to face with the gunman A Thai tourist was one of the victims, named as Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, by Thai media reports. He had recently arrived in the country on holiday, they say. He was killed with a bullet in the head on rue des Moulins, according to local TV. Another victim was a retired bank worker, aged 61, from Strasbourg. He died on rue des Chandelles, local TV reported. The third victim was Kamal Naghchband, a garage mechanic and father of three originally from Afghanistan. He had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head, his cousin told the AFP news agency. The fourth victim was 29-year-old Italian journalist Antonio Megalizzi. He was critically injured and later succumbed to his wounds. His death was announced three days after the attack. Polish national Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski, 35, has been named as the fifth victim by French media. He was in a deep coma for five days after being hit in the head before succumbing to his wounds on Sunday,Le Monde reported,external.

"Theresa May has been back in Brussels to seek changes to the Brexit withdrawal deal She met the Irish PM and the president of the European Council, before an EU summit EU leaders insist the withdrawal deal can't be renegotiated - but say some points can be clarified The PM has confirmed she will not fight the next general election Mrs May remains Tory leader after surviving a confidence vote on Wednesday night She won 200 votes, but 117 MPs voted against her Marie Jackson and Laurence Peter Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. UK withdrawal deal 'not open for renegotiation' 1. The European Council reconfirms its conclusions of 25 November 2018, in which it endorsed
the Withdrawal Agreement and approved the Political Declaration. The Union stands by this
agreement and intends to proceed with its ratification. It is not open for renegotiation. 2. The European Council reiterates that it wishes to establish as close as possible a partnership
with the United Kingdom in the future. It stands ready to embark on preparations immediately
after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as
possible after the UKâs withdrawal. 3. The European Council underlines that the backstop is intended as an insurance policy to
prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and ensure the integrity of the Single Market. It
is the Unionâs firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes
by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be
triggered. 4. The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered,
it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that
ensures that a hard border is avoided. In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours
to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the
backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only
be in place for as long as strictly necessary. 5. The European Council calls for work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the
United Kingdomâs withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes. Labour frontbencher Angela Rayner says holding another referendum could ""make us more divided"". The EU27 Brexit talks over dinner have ended, the European Council tweets. Theresa May left before the talks began. EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are to give a press conference now.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor writes: Sources have confirmed that one of the ideas being considered in Brussels to improve the controversial backstop is a start date for the future trade relationship between the UK and the EU beyond Brexit, rather than trying to agree an end date for the Irish border guarantee. Tory MPs have demanded changes to the divorce agreement with the EU over the backstop, to make it clear that it could not last for ever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. The idea of a start date for the relationship beyond Brexit is only one of the ideas being discussed by the EU and the UK. The Spanish government says it has drawn up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, but for now it is not divulging details, to avoid ""unnecessary alarm"". Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, speaking in Madrid, said ministries were working on the basis that Spain would guarantee the rights that UK citizens living in Spain currently enjoy, ""if the rights of Spaniards in the UK are guaranteed"". In 2017 an estimated 310,000 UK expats were living in Spain,the fact-checking website fullfact.org reported.,external That is the largest group of UK expats in the whole of the EU - the next largest contingents are in Ireland and France. Mr Borrell said UK expats would simply have to register as foreign residents. Spain is also negotiating an accord with the UK to let expats keep their right to vote in local elections, he said. The impact of Brexit on Gibraltar has become a thorny issue between Spain and the UK.It nearly torpedoed the withdrawal dealagreed at the last Brexit summit in November. For more on countries' no-deal Brexit plans,read this BBC roundup. Theresa May began her bid to solve the Irish border problem, which MPs say is a roadblock to backing her deal with the EU, on Tuesday. Her efforts started with a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Two days later, she is back in his company again - having survived a confidence vote in her leadership. And he has nothing but praise for her. ""She's a great leader,"" he tells BBC's Newsnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When Sir Graham Brady revealed the outcome of the vote on Theresa May's leadership last night, it wasn't only the result that had TV viewers transfixed. The venue and atmosphere of table banging and roaring approval didn't pass without comment. Our colleagues have been busy finding out more about committee room 14 and what gives it its other-worldly aura. Read about ithere. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor says: ""It feels like there are three people in this relationship: the EU, which doesnât want to budge; two different sides of the Conservative Party; and Theresa May stuck in the middle of all three... ""Sheâll be pleading to be flexible on the trickiest part of the [Brexit] compromise, but the tone from the EU top brass is that there is nothing straightforward about making a change. ""Publicly admitting that she will step down before the next election tells us that for Theresa May her options are running out fast."" EU diplomats have told Reuters news agency that an addendum attached to the EU trade deal with Canada (Ceta) could be a model for appeasing MPs hostile to Theresa May's Brexit deal. Ceta was blocked at the last minute in 2016 by left-wing politicians in Belgium's Wallonia region, who demanded extra safeguards. Reuters recalls that the fix was
a 12-page ""Joint Interpretative Instrument"" - an EU document explaining how the Ceta deal would work. The Ceta dealwas only approved after nearly eight years of negotiations.  Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel says Brexit threatens 70,000 jobs in Belgium ""if there is no good agreement that protects our economic interests and our citizens"". He promised to be vigilant to ensure ""stability and responsibility"". Research by the House of Commons Library shows,externalthat in 2017 the UK's total exports to the rest of the EU were worth Â£274bn. Total imports from the EU were Â£342bn. The EU accounted for 44.5% of the UK's exports and 53% of the UK's imports. UK imports from Belgium were 4.4% of total imports, and exports to Belgium were 3% of the total. Allow Twitter content?

"A majority of Tory MPs have said they want Boris Johnson to remain party leader and prime minister. But critics suggest his authority has been undermined and he still faces challenges to keep his job. All 359 Conservative MPs took part in the vote. Mr Johnson received the support of 211 of them, with 148 voting against him. The result means Mr Johnson was supported by 59% of his MPs. As the ballot was held in secret, Tory MPs don't have to say how they voted, but some have chosen to do so. The PM will know his opponents are not defeated Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to have been challenged. Theresa May: In a vote over her Brexit policy, Mrs May survived a confidence vote witha majority of 83 in December 2018. Despite winning, she resigned as PM six months later Iain Duncan Smith:Following months of speculation the Tory leadernarrowly lost a confidence vote in October 2003,externaland resigned John Major:Triggered a contest in 1995 byresigning as leader of the Tory party(though not as prime minister) amid disagreements inside the party over Europe. Mr Major beat challenger John Redwood, but went on to lose the 1997 election Margaret Thatcher:Resigned as PM in 1990 afterfailing to win outright victory for party leadership,external. She beat Michael Heseltine by 204 votes to 152, but was persuaded to stand down by her Cabinet Having survived, Mr Johnson can continue as Conservative Party leader and therefore prime minister. However, by-elections to pick new MPs in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton will be held on 23 June. If they are taken by opposition parties, Mr Johnson could find himself under renewed pressure. Although Mr Johnson won the vote, MPs could still consider options to try to remove him: Change the rules At present, Conservative MPs will not be allowed to hold another confidence vote for a year. However, there has been speculation the rules could be changed, in order to hold another vote sooner. When asked about it, Sir Graham Brady MP - the chairman of a group called the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory backbenchers - said ""technically, it's possible"". Cabinet pressure The Cabinet - made up senior members of the government - could put political pressure on the PM to resign. This happened toMargaret Thatcher in 1990,external, despite having defeated Michael Heseltine who had challenged for the leadership. A far less likely route would be for the Cabinet to go the Queen and declare they don't have confidence in the PM. However, this ""would drag the Queen into a very difficult position"" says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government. Motion of no confidence in the prime minister A confidence vote where all MPs - not just Conservatives - get to vote has been proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. The government is very unlikely to make time in Parliament to hold such a vote, according to Ms Haddon. However, if the leader of the opposition - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time. It would need just one more MP to vote in favour than the number voting against in order to pass. However, Tory MPs are very unlikely to go down this path says Ms Haddon: ""They would only use this mechanism as a last resort if they had no other way to dislodge Boris Johnson."" If Mr Johnson stood down, a leadership contest would be triggered. The eventual winner would become prime minister. In order to stand, candidates need the support of eight other Tory MPs. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. in the first round, candidates must get 5% of the votes to stay in the running (18 MPs) in the second round, they must get 10% (36 MPs) in the following rounds, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country - not just MPs - will vote for the winner.

"This video can not be played Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. Live updates: Theresa May faces MPs' questions Laura Kuenssberg: No surprise in May's defiance Nick Watt: Why every minute counts for Theresa May The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. She is understood to have promised not to call a ""snap general election"" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority. But, she added: ""I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election."" Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said ""she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022"". But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a ""half-hearted"" reception from MPs. She had said it was not her ""intention"" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a ""politician's word"". Allow Twitter content?

Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing. Read Laura's blog Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was ""the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29"", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would ""flush out the extremists"" in his party whose Brexit agenda was ""not in the interests of the British people"". So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive. Guide: Rules for the challenge to Theresa May Who has written no confidence letters? If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year. If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady says he phoned the prime minister to advise her the threshold of 48 letters had been reached In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: ""A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic. ""Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest."" She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to  ""deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead"". The Conservatives had to build a ""country that works for everyone"" and deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". ""I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job."" This video can not be played ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May Not immediately. She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party, a process that could take up to six weeks. If there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members. As leader of the largest party in the Commons, the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister, without a general election. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn criticises Theresa May at PMQs Mrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit - or hold another EU referendum - at a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The time for dithering and delay is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. ""There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before Parliament and let's have the vote."" Mrs May said the vote will take place, and as Labour MPs shouted ""when?"" at her she said: ""We've had a meaningful vote, we had it in in the referendum in 2016."" The PM added: ""And if he wants a meaningful date I'll give him one; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union."" Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest ""unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible"", prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches. But the SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down, saying her government was ""an embarrassment"". This video can not be played 'The inconstant gardener' - May's PMQs swipe at Labour Jacob Rees-Mogg: In the national interest, she must go The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month. But her decision to cancel Tuesday's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt. There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: ""Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it. ""Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go."" And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would ""get a kicking"" in the vote  and that their ""pompous gesturing"" will be exposed. They don't like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. Anger has focused on the so-called ""backstop"" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be ""temporary"" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated. Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. Potential runners and riders Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to ""adopt relevant conclusions"". European Council President Donald Tusk has said the ""seriousness"" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. Mrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated.

"French police have appealed for help in finding a man suspected of a Christmas market gun attack in Strasbourg that killed three people, and left a fourth brain dead and 12 others wounded. Hundreds of security personnel are searching for Cherif Chekatt, 29, on both sides of the Franco-German border. The suspect had a string of criminal convictions and had become a radical Islamist while in prison. Police say he is highly dangerous and should not be approached. French officials announced on Thursday that a third person had died in the aftermath of the Strasbourg attack. Five people were seriously wounded, they said, including a man described as brain dead. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman Chekatt has been in jail in Germany as well as France, and German reports suggested he may have received a call from Germany shortly before the Strasbourg attack. He did not answer the call, but investigators were trying to establish who was behind it, RBB Inforadio reported. Border checks on drivers near Strasbourg brought traffic to a near standstill on Thursday The French government and police union urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. A 23-year-old protester was struck by a lorry and killed at a roundabout in Avignon on Wednesday night. The lights of Paris' Eiffel Tower were turned off overnight,externalin tribute to the victims of the Strasbourg attack. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the gesture was to show the city's support to the families affected and ""all of Strasbourg"". The Eiffel Tower in Paris goes dark in tribute to the victims and ""all of Strasbourg"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman, who was injured in an exchange of fire with soldiers who were patrolling the Christmas market in Strasbourg when the attack occurred. Across the nearby border, German police were conducting searches after France's Deputy Interior Minister, Laurent NuÃ±ez, acknowledged that the gunman might no longer be in France. Border agents were checking vehicles crossing the Rhine river, which marks the Franco-German frontier, leading to long lines of traffic in both directions. This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and helping a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Mr Castaner said the country had moved to the highest level of alert, expanding police powers and increasing vigilance. He added that security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up. The mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, has said the Christmas market there will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, with flags lowered to half-mast at the local town hall. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday, a man opened fire close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber, which attracts thousands of visitors. France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. As well as the fatalities, 12 people were wounded, six of them seriously, he added. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after commandeering a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker boasted to the taxi driver that he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him in the vicinity of the police station in the Neudorf area. When he got out the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping into the night. Four people connected to the suspect had been detained overnight in Strasbourg, Mr Heitz said. Sources close to the investigation quoted by Reuters news agency said they were the suspect's mother, father and two brothers. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. By Damian Grammaticas, Strasbourg Strasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place. The lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. ""We're all shaken up,"" he said. At this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways. ""Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid,"" said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly. Strasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: ""It's shameful."" Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife. The Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports  that he was in a serious condition. One soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman. Strasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past. Not only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack. In 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot.Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later,externalfor their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack. However, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

"Geraint Thomas (in yellow) celebrates winning the 2018 Tour de France with his Team Sky team-mates The future of Team Sky, which has delivered Tour de France wins for Britons Sir Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas, is in doubt after broadcaster Sky announced it will withdraw backing at the end of 2019. Team Sky was launched in January 2010 and has since amassed 322 victories, including eight Grand Tour successes. ""Team Sky will continue to race under a different name if a new backer is secured to provide funding from the beginning of 2020,"" said a Team Sky statement. Wiggins has left the Team Sky set-up to establish his own team after retiring as a rider, but Froome and Thomas are still part of its roster, with reigning Tour champion Thomas signinga new three-year deal with Team Sky in September. Graham McWilliam, chairman of Team Sky, said it was ""the right time"" to bring the broadcaster's involvement with the cycling team to an end and it had been ""our decision"". ""It's been a pleasure and a privilege to have been on the journey with Team Sky and British Cycling right from the start. Priority now is to help find new partners to take the team into the future,""he added.,external I am 100% not a cheat - Wiggins Team Sky 'crossed ethical line' UCI drop Froome case 'A devastating blow to the biggest of reputations' BBC sports editor Dan Roan This marks the beginning of the end of an era of both success and scandal. Thanks to unmatched levels of financial support from their main backer, Team Sky have come to dominate their sport in recent years. While they will be missed by their fans, others in the sport will no doubt feel this finally gives other teams a chance to compete and is healthy for cycling. But as well as being arguably the most successful current professional team in British sport, they are also the most controversial. Sky sources tell me that the decision - taken by chief executive Jeremy Darroch - was part of a natural review of commercial partnerships after the Â£30bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster by media giant Comcast and not to do with the string of high-profile controversies that so damaged the team's reputation in recent years. But it is only a few months since a scathing report by a parliamentary committee concluded that Team Sky had ""crossed the ethical line"" over their use of medical exemptions for banned drugs. The team denied this, but the intrigue surrounding a mystery Jiffy bag - a medical delivery to Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011; the inconsistencies in Sky's explanations, and the absence of medical records at a team that was known for attention to detail and 'marginal gains', were further devastating blows. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was cleared of any wrongdoing in the case of his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol, but the saga did further damage to the team's standing. On the one hand, the timing is intriguing. Geraint Thomas' maiden Tour de France win was regarded as a timely PR boost after so much controversy and thoughts will now turn to the riders and staff, all of whom face an uncertain future. But there is more controversy to come. In February, the man at the very centre of the Jiffy bag scandal - ex-Team Sky chief medic Dr Richard Freeman - has a General Medical Council hearing when he will be asked to explain a mystery delivery of testosterone to the velodrome in 2011. Maybe Sky had simply had enough of the negative headlines, despite so many wins. This video can not be played July 2018: Former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Freeman - We never crossed the line Promising 21-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal, whose performance in this year's Tour de France marked him out as a potential Grand Tour contender,signed a new five-year deal in October. ""While Sky will be moving on at the end of next year, the team is open minded about the future and the potential of working with a new partner, should the right opportunity present itself,"" said team principal Sir Dave Brailsford. ""We aren't finished yet by any means. There is another exciting year of racing ahead of us and we will be doing everything we can to deliver more Team Sky success in 2019."" Team Sky's ambitionto become the first team to win the Tour de France,externalwith a British rider was seen as hugely ambitious when they launched.

However, the efficient but unspectacular style and big spending that has underpinned their stranglehold has proved unpopular with some fans, particularly in France. The team has also been subject to allegations of cheating. Froome, a four-time Tour winner with Sky, had an anti-doping case brought against him andsubsequently dropped by the UCI,while Wiggins has faced questions over his use ofa medical exemption for hayfever medication. TheUK Anti-Doping Agency conducted a 14-month investigationinto a 'mystery package' delivered to then-team doctor Richard Freeman on the final day of Wiggins' successful Criterium du Dauphine bid in 2011. Team Sky, Froome and Wiggins deny any wrongdoing in all three cases. US cable giant Comcast completed a Â£30bn takeover of Sky earlier this year,ousting Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Fox, who owned a minority stake in Team Sky, will also end their involvement in the team from the end of 2019. Some spectators jeered Team Sky at the 2018 Tour de France presentation event BBC chief sports writer Tom Fordyce This was news that neither principal Sir Dave Brailsford nor his riders saw coming, and it leaves a team that has dominated men's road racing facing the most uncertain of futures. The size of Sky's sponsorship over the past eight seasons transformed the balance of power in professional cycling. When Brailsford announced at the team's inception that there would be a British winner of the Tour de France it seemed an impossibility. They instead went on to win six of the last seven yellow jerseys, their budget larger than any of their rivals, their roster strong enough to feature riders in support roles who were good enough to lead many other teams. But it was a relationship always underpinned by the love that James Murdoch - former chief executive of Sky plc and 21st Century Fox - discovered for cycling mid-way through his life, the classic Mamil (middle-aged man in lycra) given an entire team to play with rather than simply a new bike. Murdoch was always hands-on. He was texting Brailsford constantly from the US as Chris Froome pulled off his remarkable late coup on stage 19 on this year's Giro d'Italia, the only of one of cycling's three Grand Tours that Sky had not won coming into 2018. The impetus for the team's jerseys featuring an anti-plastics campaign last season came from Murdoch's wife Kathryn, as did the design for the black orca that figured on the back of the white kit. When Murdoch resigned from 21st Century Fox after Sky were taken over by US giants Comcast, a critical link in the chain had been removed. This is not necessarily the end for the team. Team sponsorships in cycling change frequently. While the size of Sky's investment may be been unprecedented, their length of tenure was unusual too. But finding a sponsor willing to match that financial commitment, at a time of significant financial stress on British companies and after a string of controversies about some of Sky's practices, will perhaps be Brailsford's biggest challenge yet.

"A warmer Arctic has less food and more insects, making it a much worse environment for caribou The population of wild reindeer, or caribou, in the Arctic has crashed by more than half in the last two decades. A new report on the impact of climate change in the Arctic revealed that numbers fell from almost 5 million to around 2.1 million animals. The report was released at the American Geophysical Research Union meeting. It revealed how weather patterns and vegetation changes are making the Arctic tundra a much less hospitable place for reindeer. Reindeer and caribou are the same species, but the vast, wild herds in northern Canada and Alaska are referred to as caribou. It is these herds that are faring the worst, according to scientists monitoring their numbers. Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - ""such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight"", thisArctic Report Card,externalstated. Palu tsunami clue found on seafloor East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' There are multiple reasons. Prof Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating. ""We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation."" The Arctic is greening, but that is not good news for reindeer The lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. ""Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,"" he told BBC News. Another very big issue is the number of insects. ""Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,"" said Prof Epstein. ""It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou. ""If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects."" Rain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food. At the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase. The Arctic Report Card revealed that the region was entering uncharted territory due to climate change But scientists say we have opened the door on the ""world's freezer"" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate. The report, compiled by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in ""uncharted territory"". ""In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,"" she said. ""And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world."" Some other key points from the report included: Plastic pollution:tiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris. Air temperature:For the past five years (2014-18) temperatures have exceeded all previous records since 1900. Sea ice thinning:In 2018 Arctic sea ice remained younger, thinner, and covered less area than in the past. Toxic blooms:Warming Arctic Ocean conditions are coinciding with an expansion of harmful algal blooms in the ocean, which threaten food sources. Also here at AGU, scientists have revealed thatEast Antarctica's glaciers have begun to ""wake up""and show a response to warming.

"Mr Paisley was recently suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for ""serious misconduct"" DUP MP Ian Paisley was given a complimentary holiday at a luxury Maldives resort months after advocating on behalf of its government. BBC Spotlight obtained new evidence which suggested the visit was requested by the Maldivian government and facilitated by the resort owner, who had political links. The programme examined whether the MP should have declared the trip in 2016. He said he paid for part of the holiday and the rest was paid for by a friend. The North Antrim MP did not reveal the identity of this friend. He said the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work. Ian Paisley in his own words 'Petition result is a miracle' - Paisley Profile: DUP MP Ian Paisley A DUP spokesman said: ""The party officers will want to consider these very serious matters being mindful of the high standards we require of elected representatives."" Mr Paisley was recently suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for ""serious misconduct""for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013. Ian Paisley, his wife and his two sons received full-board five-night stay at the luxury resort in October and November 2016, eight months after he was part of a controversial parliamentary visit to the islands. Gavin Millar QC, an expert on parliamentary rules, said the Nolan principles on standards in public life placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he had not registered the trip to the Maldives. ""MPs should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands,"" said Mr Millar. ""Now his decision in this case, his decision was not to register the benefit, after the trip in late 2016, and he has an obligation to give reasons for that decision. ""Unless he can come up with some wider public interest argument for not saying more, he should be saying significantly more about any considerations that are relevant to the motive of that source in paying that money."" Mr Paisley has been contacted by Spotlight about Mr Millar's comments but has not responded. In a statement to Spotlight on Tuesday, Mr Paisley said: ""I have responded in clear and categoric terms to your questions. ""For the record, the government of the Maldives did not organise or pay for my family vacation in 2016, which I do not intend to go into with you. I'm satisfied the vacation did not have to be recorded on the register."" Ian Paisley visited the Maldives in February 2016 with two other MPs from an All-Party Parliamentary Group. At the time, the Maldives government, headed by President Abdulla Yameen, was being criticised by organisations including the United Nations and the Commonwealth for human rights abuses. Mr Paisley, however, appeared to advocate on behalf of the regime, speaking out against economic sanctions. With the other two MPs, he also visited the prison where opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed had been held, and described the conditions as quite luxurious. BBC Spotlight reporter Lyndsey Telford travelled to the Maldives as part of her investigation Later that year Mr Paisley travelled to the Maldives again for a holiday with his wife and two children. Spotlight's evidence, including an image which appears to be from the resort's internal records provided to the programme by an anonymous source, suggests that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of Mr Yameen's government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy. Mr Hilmy is a former minister in the Maldives government and has held a number of other important public posts. Gavin Millar QC said that if, as Spotlight's documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy, Mr Paisley should not have accepted it. ""But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly. ""There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Maldives government."" Ian Paisley has denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Maldives. Last week, Ian Paisley told Spotlight that he had discussed the holiday in the Maldives with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his Sri Lanka holidays. Mr Paisley claimed that as a consequence of that conversation, he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday. Ian Paisley told Spotlight he had evidence which ""categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government"" After Spotlight contacted the commissioner's office, Mr Paisley got in touch with Spotlight again to clarify that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed. He said he had in fact spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members' interests. Mr Millar QC said the registrar's role was limited. ""The one thing they can give you as an MP is a clear account of what the rules require and what they don't require,"" eh said. ""But I understand that is as far as they will go. They will not give a licence to an MP not to declare in a particular situation nor will they say you must declare in a particular situation. The Maldives is a republic that lies south-west of the Indian sub-continent. It is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited. Its political history has been unsettled since the electoral defeat of long-serving President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in 2008. Read more here. ""That's not how the code works. The way the code works is that it is ultimately always a matter for the MP."" Ian Paisley also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, ""categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government"". Two emails, which he had arranged from contacts linked to the regime and the resort. The first was from Ahmed Shiaan, who was the Maldivian Ambassador to the UK at the time of the visit. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Maldives. Ian Paisley also sent Spotlight an email from the resort's commercial operating officer, Andrew Ashmore, who said invoices for the stay had been settled and paid for privately although he could not say by whom. Political rivals have been quick to criticise Mr Paisley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn FÃ©in has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards asking her to investigate the allegations. North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said there are ""serious questions to answer"" about Mr Paisley's relation with the government of the Maldives. Alliance leader Naomi Long said Mr Paisley had left himself open to criticism by not revealing his friend's identity. ""If this wasn't related to parliamentary duties the easiest way to clarify that is by saying who gave the gift and why,"" she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.

Mr Eastwood later tweeted: ""I've written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards asking her to investigate Spotlight's allegations on Ian Paisley."" TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Paisley now should ""refer himself to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, so that a considered verdict can be delivered"". The UUP leader, Robin Swann, called on the commissioner to launch an investigation ""urgently"". When the Daily Telegraph published revelations about his holidays to Sri Lanka in 2017, Mr Paisley initially said that the articles were ""devoid of logic"" and threatened legal action. He also referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The Commissioner, Kathryn Stone, found that Mr Paisley had failed to properly declare two holidays and engaged in paid advocacy for the Sri Lankan government. Her findings were supported by parliament which suspended Mr Paisley from the House of Commons for 30 days. However, a petition to trigger a by-election in his North Antrim constituency fell short by 444 votes, an outcome described by Mr Paisley as a ""miracle"". On his return to the House of Commons following his suspension, he said: ""A smaller man than me would have crumbled."" Mr Paisley has been MP for North Antrim since 2010, succeeding his father Ian Paisley, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and Democratic Unionist leader, who had held the seat since 1970.

"President Donald Trump denies the allegations made by Stormy Daniels A US judge has ordered porn actress Stormy Daniels to reimburse President Donald Trump's legal fees after her defamation case was thrown out. Ms Daniels, who says she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, sued him after he mocked her claim that a stranger had threatened her to keep quiet. On Tuesday, a judge ordered her to pay over $293,052.33 (Â£234,000) - roughly 75% of Mr Trump's legal fees. A lawyer for Mr Trump celebrated the ruling as a ""total victory"". Trump insults Stormy Daniels In Tuesday's ruling, Los Angeles Judge James Otero declined to impose the ""significant additional sanctions"" requested by the US president's legal team against Ms Daniels. Mr Trump's attorney, Charles Harder, had earlier requested that Ms Daniels be forced to pay almost $800,000 after her lawsuit was dismissed in October. He said on Tuesday that the penalty includes $1,000 for having filed a ""meritless"" case. ""The court's order,"" Mr Harder said, ""along with the court's prior order dismissing Stormy Daniels' defamation case against the President, together constitute a total victory for the President, and a total defeat for Stormy Daniels in this case."" Ms Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said in a tweet that the ruling ""will never hold up on appeal"". Mr Avenatti is representing Ms Daniels in another lawsuit against Mr Trump and his former attorney Michael Cohen. The adult film actress is seeking to void a nondisclosure agreement about her alleged affair with the president. Ms Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, said last April that she had been threatened by a man in a car park to keep quiet about the alleged affair. She shared a sketch of the man who she claimed had threatened her and her child. Mr Trump retweeted the image, calling it a ""total con job"", and describing the image as being of a ""non-existent man"". Stormy Daniels' lawyer arrested The president and the porn star: Why this matters She sued arguing that the president's tweet was defamatory as it accused Ms Daniels of ""committing a serious crime"" - namely, falsely accusing a person of threatening her. But in October, the judge ruled that Mr Trump's tweet was protected under the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech. The judge said Mr Trump's tweet was merely a ""hyperbolic statement"" against a political antagonist. After that initial court victory, Mr Trump promptly took to Twitter, saying his legal team could now ""go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer"". Mr Trump's former personal attorney, Mr Cohen, will be sentenced in New York on Wednesday for paying Ms Daniels $130,000 to keep the alleged liaison private. According to prosecutors, Mr Cohen was directed to make the payment to Ms Daniels - and to another woman - by Mr Trump. Mr Trump has acknowledged the payment was made, describing it only this week as ""a simple private transaction"", though he denies having a sexual relationship with her. Mr Cohen has admitted the payment, which was not reported to election officials, was a violation of campaign finance laws.

"A warmer Arctic has less food and more insects, making it a much worse environment for caribou The population of wild reindeer, or caribou, in the Arctic has crashed by more than half in the last two decades. A new report on the impact of climate change in the Arctic revealed that numbers fell from almost 5 million to around 2.1 million animals. The report was released at the American Geophysical Research Union meeting. It revealed how weather patterns and vegetation changes are making the Arctic tundra a much less hospitable place for reindeer. Reindeer and caribou are the same species, but the vast, wild herds in northern Canada and Alaska are referred to as caribou. It is these herds that are faring the worst, according to scientists monitoring their numbers. Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - ""such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight"", thisArctic Report Card,externalstated. Palu tsunami clue found on seafloor East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' There are multiple reasons. Prof Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating. ""We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation."" The Arctic is greening, but that is not good news for reindeer The lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. ""Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,"" he told BBC News. Another very big issue is the number of insects. ""Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,"" said Prof Epstein. ""It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou. ""If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects."" Rain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food. At the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase. The Arctic Report Card revealed that the region was entering uncharted territory due to climate change But scientists say we have opened the door on the ""world's freezer"" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate. The report, compiled by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in ""uncharted territory"". ""In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,"" she said. ""And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world."" Some other key points from the report included: Plastic pollution:tiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris. Air temperature:For the past five years (2014-18) temperatures have exceeded all previous records since 1900. Sea ice thinning:In 2018 Arctic sea ice remained younger, thinner, and covered less area than in the past. Toxic blooms:Warming Arctic Ocean conditions are coinciding with an expansion of harmful algal blooms in the ocean, which threaten food sources. Also here at AGU, scientists have revealed thatEast Antarctica's glaciers have begun to ""wake up""and show a response to warming. This is evidence of unprecedented climate-driven change at the top and bottom of the planet.

"The chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been granted bail by a Canadian court. Meng Wanzhou was arrested on 1 December and could be extradited to the US to face fraud charges linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran. A judge in Vancouver set bail at C$10m (Â£6m; $7.4m). She will be under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. US President Donald Trump now says he is willing to intervene in the case. Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress What's going on with Huawei? Ms Meng, 46, is the daughter of Huawei's founder and her detention has angered China and soured its relations with both Canada and the US. This comes against the background of an increasingly acrimonious trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. Ms Meng is accused in the US of using a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. President Trump told Reuters news agency that he could intervene in the US Justice Department's case against Ms Meng in order to avoid further deterioration in relations with China. ""Whatever's good for this country, I would do,"" said Mr Trump. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made - which is a very important thing - what's good for national security , I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary."" At the three-day bail hearing in Vancouver, her lawyers sought to provide guarantees that she would not pose a flight risk if released. The application was opposed by Canadian prosecutors. US prosecutors say Ms Meng had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company from Huawei in order to avoid sanctions on Iran. It is also alleged she deceived banks about the true relationship between the two companies. Ms Meng has denied any wrongdoing and said she will contest the allegations. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder Applause broke out in the courtroom when Justice William Ehrcke granted bail. Ms Meng cried and hugged her lawyers. The judge ordered her to reappear in court on 6 February. After the ruling, Huawei issued a statement, saying: ""We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach a just conclusion."" Supporters of Meng Wanzhou gathered outside the court in Vancouver China had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released the Huawei executive. Earlier on Tuesday it emerged thata Canadian former diplomat had been detained in China. Michael Kovrig's current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was working for his prompt release. There has been no official word from China about his whereabouts. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was in direct contact with Chinese authorities concerning the case. Mr Kovrig previously worked as a diplomat in Beijing, Hong Kong and at the UN in New York. Canadian officials said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link between Mr Kovrig's reported detention and the arrest of Ms Meng. Timeline: What's going on with Huawei?

"Teenagers who are victims of neglect, bullying, crime, family violence and sexual exploitation are more likely to self-harm and have suicidal thoughts, a study from King's College London finds. The report says the picture is complex, with other pre-existing vulnerabilities like low self-esteem or an unsupportive home also playing a part. But it says schemes to stop adolescents becoming victims may lower the risks. Suicide and self-harm are major causes of death among young people worldwide. Figures from theWorld Health Organization,externalpublished last year show that globally: suicide and accidental death from self-harm led to an estimated 67,000 deaths this was the most common cause of adolescent mortality in 2015, after road injuries, respiratory infections and complications in pregnancy in Europe and South-East Asia, it is one of the top two causes of adolescent death self-harm largely occurs among older adolescents, and globally it is the second leading cause of death for older adolescent girls. The researchers examined material gathered from a long-term study of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales in 1994-95. They looked at a wide range of adolescent victimisation - maltreatment, neglect, sexual victimisation, family violence, peer/sibling violence, cyber-victimisation, and crime - through interviews with participants when they were 18 years old. The study found that more than one-third of adolescents had experienced at least one type of severe victimisation between the ages of 12 and 18 and 7% had experienced three or more severe types of victimisation. Almost a fifth (18.9%) had had some form of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours. Bullied MP 'mentally tortured' as a child Teeth-grinding 'linked to school bullying' Childhood bullying anxiety 'goes away' The researchers found that teenagers who were victims were much more likely than their non-victimised peers to have these sorts of thoughts. For each additional victimisation type experienced, the risk of contemplating suicide and of self-harming doubled, and the risk of attempting suicide tripled, they found. Half of adolescents exposed to three or more types of victimisation had experienced suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and a quarter had attempted suicide. The study acknowledges that ""pre-existing vulnerabilities"" are a major factor in these thoughts and behaviours. But, after making adjustments for family and individual vulnerabilities, victimised teens still showed an increase in suicidal thoughts (though not suicide attempts) and self-harming. The study says preventing adolescents from becoming victims - for example through school-based anti-bullying schemes, family support programmes and community safety initiatives - could help reduce the likelihood of them having suicidal thoughts or self-harming. But it also concludes that effective interventions to prevent premature death in victimised adolescents should also address pre-existing vulnerabilities. Lead author Jessie Baldwin from King's College London told the BBC: ""Our findings showed that victimisation in adolescence is an important risk factor for suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempts. ""Therefore, adolescents known to have experienced maltreatment, bullying, cyber-victimisation, and other forms of victimisation should be supported to prevent them from self-harming or taking their own lives. ""Because victimised adolescents' elevated risk of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours was in part due to their pre-existing vulnerabilities, clinicians treating victimised adolescents should address these vulnerabilities. ""More broadly, professionals working with young people should appreciate that victimised adolescents have a range of vulnerabilities to poor mental health and self-harm.""

"Vladimir Putin was 33 when he received this Stasi ID card A Stasi ID pass used by Vladimir Putin when he was a Soviet spy in former East Germany has been found in the Stasi secret police archive in Dresden. The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass was found during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi. Mr Putin, then a KGB major, got it in 1985. It got him into Stasi facilities, but he may not have spied for them. In a statement on Tuesday, the Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin ""received the pass so that he could carry out his KGB work in co-operation with the Stasi"". Stasi was actually the nickname for East German Ministry of State Security (MfS) agents. It was notorious for its meticulous surveillance of ordinary citizens, many of whom were pressed into spying on each other. ""Current research gives no indication that Vladimir Putin worked for the MfS,"" the BStU statement said. Vladimir Putin's formative German years Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president In pictures: Secret lives of the Stasi The stamps are proof of Mr Putin's years co-operating with the Stasi in Dresden Mr Putin signed himself ""Wladimir Putin"" using German spelling Mr Putin, born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), was posted to East Germany in 1985, aged 33. His two daughters were born during that posting. He is now 66. Mr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden up to and including December 1989, when the communist East German regime collapsed amid mass pro-democracy protests. His Stasi pass was renewed every three months, as shown by the stamps on it. It is not clear why he left the pass in the Stasi files in Dresden. This building was the KGB's headquarters in Dresden during the Cold War He witnessed protesters occupying the Dresden Stasi headquarters, while communist security forces came close to opening fire on them, on 5 December 1989. Jubilant East Berliners had already breached the Berlin Wall in November. Mr Putin was fluent in German at the time and has said he personally calmed the Dresden crowd when they surrounded the KGB building there, warning them that it was Soviet territory. During his KGB service in Dresden Mr Putin was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1989 he was awarded a bronze medal by communist East Germany - officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - ""for faithful service to the National People's Army"",the Kremlin website says.,external After returning to Russia, Mr Putin rose to become head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - main successor to the KGB. He became Russian president in 2000. In June 2017Mr Putin revealed that his work in the KGB,externalhad involved ""illegal intelligence-gathering"". Speaking on Russian state TV, he said KGB spies were people with ""special qualities, special convictions and a special type of character"". A once top secret agreement between the KGB and Stasi, seen by the BBC, shows that the KGB had 30 liaison officers in East Germany who worked directly alongside the Stasi. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged off the emergence of Mr Putin's old Stasi card. ""The KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies so you probably can't rule out an exchange of such identity cards,"" he said.

Staff from Capital Gazette, the US newspaper where five people were killed, are featured, along with Maria Ressa of the Philippines and the wives of Myanmar's Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Reality Check: Are journalists increasingly under attack? The wives of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo hold pictures of their husbands; Maria Ressa Time said they were chosen ""for taking great risks in pursuit of greater truths, for the imperfect but essential quest for facts, for speaking up and for speaking out"". Jamal Khashoggi was a well-known Saudi journalist and vocal critic of the Saudi Arabian leadership. He disappeared after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death The Saudi authorities have admitted he was killed inside the building on the orders, they say, of rogue intelligence officers. But many in the international community believe he was killed on the orders of theSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, of whom he had been critical. Mr Khashoggi had been in self-imposed exile in the US, from where he wrote a column for the Washington Post. He was in Istanbul seeking documentation so he could marry his Turkish fiancee. The killing has led to international condemnation of Saudi Arabia, but US President Trump and his administration have refrained from joining others in blaming MBS. The CIA is reported to have concluded the killing was ordered by MBS, but Mr Trump's son-in-lawJared Kushner told Fox News that US intelligence agencies were still ""making their assessments"",external. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The journalist who vanished into a consulate A gunman walked into the offices of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland,  on 28 July andkilled five members of editorial staff. The suspect had a longstanding grudge against the newspaper after unsuccessfully suing it for defamation in 2012, investigators later said. Despite the horror that unfolded in their workplace,staff worked in the car parkto put out an edition the next day. As well as publishing the obituaries of their colleagues, they left the editorial page blank with a note saying they were speechless. Capital Gazette reporters were pictured working on the next day's newspaper from the car park Former CNN journalist Maria Ressa founded her online news site Rappler in the Philippines in 2012, and it has since gained a reputation for hard-hitting, investigative journalism. It has been openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte, questioning the accuracy of his public statements, particularly over his deadly war on drugs. Maria Ressa had to attend a court hearing earlier this month A few months after his election in 2016, Rappler publisheda detailed report into allegations that automated bots and fake Facebook accounts were used to amplify the pro-Duterte message,external- something the president's team denied. Mr Duterte has labelled the site's reports as ""twisted"" and banned its political reporter from entering the presidential offices. In January this year, Rappler had its licence revoked by the state, igniting a national debate about press freedom. This November, Maria Ressa and her news site wereaccused of tax evasion- something she said was a ""clear form of continuing intimidation and harassment"". Why Rappler is raising Philippine press freedom fears Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, both citizens of Myanmar, were sentenced to seven years in jail in September for violating a state secrets act. It stemmed from their work in September 2017 investigating the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the northern Rakhine village of Inn Dinn. Kyaw Soe Oo (left) and Wa Lone say they have done nothing wrong The two journalists were arrested in December 2017 while carrying official documents they had been given by two police officers. They have always maintained their innocence and say they were set up by the police. The case has been widely seen as a test of press freedom in Myanmar. Read their report 'Massacre in Myanmar',external The story behind the journalists' arrest Seeing through the official story in Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, who was once seen as a beacon of human rights and democracy, has faced international condemnation for her government's handling of the case. She defended the verdictsaying the two journalists had broken the law and that their conviction had ""nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"". Last year, the magazine named ""the Silence Breakers"" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its ""Person of the Year"". This year's readers' poll chose Korean pop band BTS as their winner, with Planet Earth coming second. The magazine's tradition - begun in 1927 as ""Man of the Year"" - recognises the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"". The great majority of people selected have been individuals - but by no means all. In 2014, ""Ebola fighters"" were recognised while in 2011 ""The Protester"" acknowledged the significance of the so-called Arab Spring. It was in 1950, Time explains, that the magazine decided groups, as well as individuals, could be chosen as ""Person of the Year"".,external ""The American fighting-man"" was chosen that year, and was followed by the Hungarian people in 1956 and later on Scientists, Americans under 25 and Mr and Mrs Middle America. In 2006, the Person of the Year was simply ""You"", with a mirror cover design, reflecting the importance of user-generated internet content.
