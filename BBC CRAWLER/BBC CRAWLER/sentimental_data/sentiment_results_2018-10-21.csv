"A Tristan albatross on Gough Island: Their future is now at risk Super-sized mice are killing millions of seabird chicks on a remote island in the South Atlantic, threatening some rare species with extinction. According to a study from the RSPB, the mice have learned to eat the eggs and chicks of the many millions of birds that make Gough Island their home. The group says that without action, the endangered Tristan albatross is likely to go extinct. A campaign is planned to eradicate the mice entirely in 2020. Restoring South Georgia's wildlife paradise Same-sex mice have babies Gough Island is a remote UK Overseas Territory, considered to be one of the world's most important seabird colonies, hosting more than 10 million birds. A Gough Island albatross chick. The mice eat them alive Mice were introduced to the 91-sq-km volcanic island by sailors during the 19th Century. The rodents have adapted to the limited resources on the small piece of land by developing a taste for seabird eggs and chicks. Video cameras have recorded groups of up to nine mice eating the chicks alive. As a result of their success, the mice have become ""super-sized"". They are about 50% larger than a domestic mouse. ""Many of the seabirds on Gough are small and nest in burrows,"" said Dr Anthony Caravaggi, from University College Cork, in the Republic of Ireland. ""The chicks are smaller and have no escape route, so for an opportunistic mouse these chicks constitute relatively easy prey. ""The mice have done so well that they've grown bigger and are now attacking all seabirds, even Tristan albatross chicks, which are far bigger than other, smaller sea-going birds."" One of the larger than average mice that are now wreaking havoc on Gough island According to Dr Caravaggi's study, at least two million chicks are being lost on an annual basis. The big worries are the rare species on Gough, especially the Tristan albatross. Just 2,000 pairs now remain. The albatrosses mate for life and produce just one egg every other year. Parents have been recorded returning with food to find their chicks dead in the nest. Their extinction looks certain within a number of decades. ""In a very short space of time, the Tristan albatross will be lost and this is also true for a number of other species,"" said Dr Caravaggi. ""Even though the Tristan is the headline here, a great number of others, including the Atlantic petrel and MacGillivray's prion will follow suit if the mice aren't removed."" Given that the mice have adapted to the opportunity that the seabirds present, why haven't the seabirds also reacted to the threat? An Atlantic Yellow nosed albatross ""The fact is that these bird species evolved to live on islands free from predators; that's why you get so many seabirds there,"" said Dr Alex Bond, from the Natural History Museum, another author on the paper. ""For mice there are maybe new generations twice a year, but for birds like the Tristan albatross, they spend their first 10 years out at sea, so it takes a really long time for these behavioural mechanisms to kick in."" The RSPB, in conjunction with the government of Tristan da Cunha, who are custodians of Gough island, have developed a plan to wipe the mice out completely. The operation is due to take place in 2020. Given the location of the island, it is an enormous logistical challenge. It involves chartering a ship from South Africa, which will carry two helicopters and a load of poisonous, cereal pellets. These will then be spread across the island by the helicopters. They contain an anticoagulant which should kill the mice within 24 hours. ""Ridding islands of invasive species has been done on around 700 islands worldwide,"" said Dr Bond. ""So this isn't some novel thing we are doing; this is a tried-and-tested technique that can deliver the solution we need.""

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death The UK, France and Germany have denounced writer Jamal Khashoggi's killing, demanding urgent clarification from Saudi Arabia over his death. A joint statement said the explanation that Mr Khashoggi died after a ""fist fight"" in the consulate in Istanbul needed ""to be backed by facts to be considered credible"". President Donald Trump earlier said he was ""not satisfied"" with the account. And Turkey's president on Sunday vowed to reveal the truth about the death. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would make a statement on the matter in parliament on Tuesday. ""We are looking for justice here and this will be revealed in all its naked truth,"" he told a rally in Istanbul. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate on 2 October to sort out divorce papers. Saudi Arabia initially said he had left shortly afterwards but has now admitted he died inside the building. The UK, France and Germany expressed shock at the death, saying: ""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" They said they noted the Saudi explanation, but added: ""There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible."" The nations said they would not make a judgement until further explanation had been detailed. They said: ""We therefore ask for the investigation to be carried out thoroughly until responsibilities are clearly established and that there is proper accountability and due process for any crimes committed."" This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul On Saturday, Mr Trump said: ""I'm not satisfied until we find the answer."" But the US president said that, although sanctions were a possibility, halting an arms deal would ""hurt us more than it would hurt them"". US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that on Sunday, saying talk of sanctions was ""premature"". Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the Saudi ""explanations offered to date lack consistency and credibility"" while Australian PM Scott Morrison said: ""This cannot stand. This will not do."" Amnesty International has called the Saudi explanation a whitewash of ""an appalling assassination"". The Washington Post, which published articles by Mr Khashoggi, said the Saudi government had ""shamefully and repeatedly offered one lie after another"". Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir spoke to Fox News on Sunday. He suggested individuals had attempted to cover up the killing to his government and that it did not know the details. ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority. There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up,"" Mr Jubeir said. He added: ""We want to make sure that those who are responsible are punished."" Mr Jubeir also said: ""We don't know where the body is."" So far Saudi Arabia says it has arrested 18 people, sacked two aides of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and set up a body, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency. Yes, from a number of regional neighbours. On Sunday, Kuwait was the latest ally to praise King Salman for his handling of the case, saying it showed ""the kingdom's keenness and commitment to establish the truth and its respect for legal principles to bring to account those behind this regretful event"". Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have been among those reflecting similar praise. Saudi media on Sunday echoed this. The al-Riyadh newspaper reported a ""wide welcome"" of the government's ""justice and firmness"". Turkey on Saturday said it would release all the details and that it would not allow a cover up. Mr Erdogan's planned statement will be eagerly anticipated. Although Turkey has so far stopped short of officially blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing, investigators have said they have audio and video evidence which shows Mr Khashoggi, was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate. Investigators are searching Belgrad forest for the body Police have searched the nearby Belgrad forest in Istanbul where they believe the body may have been taken and one official was hopeful its fate would be known ""before long"". Both the consulate and the residence of the Saudi consul have been searched too. Reuters reported on Sunday it had spoken to a Saudi official who said Mr Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. A Saudi operative then reportedly donned Mr Khashoggi's clothes and left the consulate.

"This video can not be played How Saudi critics keep going missing Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on a ""rogue operation"", giving a new account of an act that sparked a global outcry. Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News ""the murder"" had been a ""tremendous mistake"" and denied the powerful crown prince had ordered it. Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The Saudis, under intense pressure to explain Khashoggi's whereabouts, have offered conflicting accounts. They initially said he had left the consulate on 2 October - but on Friday admitted for the first time he was dead, saying he had been killed in a fight. This claim met widespread scepticism. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi All you need to know about his death Turkish officials believe Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was murdered by a team of Saudi agents inside the building and say they have evidence to prove it. Adel al-Jubeir's comments, describing the incident as murder, are some of the most direct to come from a Saudi official. ""We are determined to find out all the facts and we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder,"" he said. Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Saudi summit website attacked by hackers ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" he added. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" The minister also said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was and insisted the action had not been ordered byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seen as the country's most powerful figure. ""Even the senior leadership of our intelligence service was not aware of this,"" he said, calling it a ""rogue operation"". Who was the victim? 'The Arab world is facing its own Iron Curtain' However, Yeni Safak, a media outlet close to Turkey's government, says it has information showing that the office of the crown prince received four phone calls from the consulate after the killing. Reuters news agency reported on Sunday it had spoken to a Saudi official who said Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. A Saudi operative then reportedly donned Khashoggi's clothes and left the consulate. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Separately, CNN quoted a senior Turkish official as saying a Saudi agent had been captured on surveillance footage dressed as the journalist. The video appears to show the man leaving the consulate by the back door on the day the journalist was killed, wearing Khashoggi's clothes, a fake beard and glasses, CNN said. In another development, Turkish police found a car belonging to the Saudi consulate left in an underground car park in Istanbul. The police asked prosecutors and Saudi diplomats for permission to search the vehicle. Turkish media also posted footage apparently showing Saudi consular staff in Istanbul burning documents a day after Khashoggi's disappearance. Saudi Arabia admitted for the first time on Friday that the journalist had died, suggesting he had been killed in a fight with some of the people he was meeting inside the consulate. Until this point the authorities had maintained that the Saudi critic was last seen leaving the building alive. Officials say they have arrested 18 people, sacked two aides of Mohammed bin Salman and set up a body, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency over the killing. Both King Salman and the crown prince called Khashoggi's son, Salah, on Sunday to express their condolences over his death, the Saudi Press Agency reports. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Salah Khashoggi resides in Saudi Arabia and had reportedly been barred from leaving the country to visit his father who was living in self-imposed exile in the US. Meanwhile, Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, who raised the alarm about his disappearance after waiting for him for hours outside the consulate, was given 24-hour police protection, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reports. Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dismissed the Saudi version of events. ""One cannot help but wonder how there could have been a 'fist fight' between 15 young expert fighters... and a 60-year-old Khashoggi, alone and defenceless,"" he wrote in Yeni Safak newspaper. ""The more one thinks about it, the more it feels like our intelligence is being mocked."" President Erdogan said he would reveal the ""naked truth"" of the matter in parliament on Tuesday. US PresidentDonald Trump earlier said there had been ""deception"" and ""lies"" in Saudi Arabia's explanation,external, having previously said he found their narrative to be credible. The UK, France and Germany expressed shock at the death and demanded a full explanation. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt condemned the killing ""in the strongest possible terms"". He acknowledged Britain's close security links with Saudi Arabia but warned that London would ""act accordingly"" if ""the appalling stories we are reading turn out to be true"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier said she would not allow arms exports to Saudi Arabia to continue, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a multi-billion dollar defence contract. But several of Saudi Arabia's regional allies - including Kuwait and Egypt - have come out in its support. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon?

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Now is the time to play for the team"" The Brexit Secretary has said he understands Tory ""jitters"" about EU negotiations but urged MPs to hold their nerve as talks continue. ""The end is in sight in terms of a good deal, the prize we want,"" Dominic Raab said, asking them to ""wait and see"". It comes amid newspaper speculation that Theresa May could face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs. On Saturday, protesters marched through London to call for a public vote on whatever Brexit deal is negotiated. Raab: Longer transition or backstop - not both Commons bid to block Brexit 'backstop' People's Vote march: In pictures Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Some Tory MPs were angered last week by a suggestion that the post-Brexit ""transition period"" - designed to smooth the path between the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 and a future long-term relationship with Brussels - could be extended. Ex-Tory leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that would see the UK paying the EU ""tens of billions"" more and he said the negotiations ""look more like a capitulation"". Moray MP Douglas Rosssaid Scotland's 13 Conservative MPs would not support a dealif the UK remained part of the Common Fisheries Policy beyond 2020. And Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgentold the Mail on Sunday,externalTheresa May was ""drinking in the last chance saloon"" and must attend a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers this week. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that he was ""open minded"" about the possibility of extending the transition period - which the government calls the implementation period - for about ""three months or so"" if needed, as long as it was clear how the UK would get out of it, to avoid ""any sense that we are left indefinitely in a sort of customs union limbo"". Please upgrade your browser He said: ""I think it's understandable there are jitters on all sides of this debate and we need to hold our nerve. The end is in sight in terms of a good deal - the prize we want - a good deal with the EU and I think colleagues should wait and see what that looks like."" He added: ""We won't want to bring something back which we aren't confident is a very good deal for the United Kingdom.  But now is the time to play for the team, I think that's the way we get the best deal for the EU and I also think that's what the country expects from us."" Asked if, realistically, the withdrawal agreement could still be being negotiated after November, he replied: ""I think if it went any distance beyond that we would have a problem with implementing the deal, and it would almost be the worst-case scenario - we'd have a deal but couldn't implement it in time."" This video can not be played Saturday saw huge crowds march in London to demand a further EU referendum Meanwhile Brexit minister Suella Braverman has told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics that she supports the prime minister, but refused to say whether she would back her in a confidence vote. She said: ""I don't think there will be a vote of confidence in the prime minister and I am supporting the prime minister unequivocally and I want her to get on with the job to deliver Brexit and I know that she will be doing that."" The UK voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. It is due to leave on 29 March 2019 but during the post-Brexit ""transition period"", set to run until 31 December 2020, the UK-EU relationship will stay largely the same. If at the end of that period, a long-term ""future relationship"", including trade deal, is not ready, both sides have agreed on the need for provisions to ensure there is no need for customs checks - a ""hard border"" - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in the interim period. This is called the ""backstop"" - but the two sides have yet to agree on what form it should take and how long it could last. This video can not be played Keir Starmer: If a deal is made by the end of the year, it won't last On Saturday,protesters took part in a huge march to London's Parliament Square to call for another referendum- this time on any final Brexit deal that is negotiated. Organisers say it attracted about 700,000 people. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the march reflected ""a much bigger group, both Leave and Remain [voters], who are utterly losing confidence in the prime minister's ability"" to bring back a good deal. Asked if Labour MPs would back Mrs May in Parliament, rather than risk a ""no deal"" exit from the EU, he said: ""We do not accept this proposition it's that or no deal, and it's not just us. There's a huge majority in Parliament that will not accept that the alternative to Theresa May's deal, if there is one, is no deal."" He added: ""I don't think anybody thinks this 30-year civil war in the Tory party on Europe is going to end before Christmas. ""What we're going to see is even if there's a deal, the Tory party will try to rip it up next year... They will not stop fighting about this. ""We've got to the very serious situation where people are saying 'Is this government actually capable of delivering because it's so divided?'.""

"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan President Donald Trump has said the US will ""begin cutting off"" foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of a large convoy of migrants heading north. Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US. The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border. Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse. The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (Â£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development. ""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday. The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there."" This video can not be played Celebrations and sickness - thousands of migrants make it to Mexico, but what happens next? Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries. Watch: Migrant caravan travels north By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey. Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border. Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others. But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president. His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"". He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves. On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river. ""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany HernÃ¡ndez told AFP news agency. It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media. One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula. The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days. A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence. Many of those in the caravan are women with children Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media. They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence. Playing mother to El Salvador's gang children Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' How gang violence is spreading fear in El Salvador The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border. The caravan has been growing in size with more people joining along the way Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border. A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well. However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures. Honduran President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on. Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge. About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening. In pictures: Migrants face border tear gas On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics. ""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency. ""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa. Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy. ""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said. Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported. Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"". This video can not be played Migrant caravan: 'May God soften Trump's heart' ""We're exhausted, it's been a terribly difficult journey but we have hope: we've made it to Mexico, which means a lot to us,"" a migrant called JosÃ© Luis told BBC Mundo. A woman called MarÃ­a, who is taking part in the caravan with her husband and her two small children, told BBC Mundo's Ana Gabriela Rojas: ""We are very happy to be here and we ask Mexican authorities and people to let us pass through.

"This video can not be played The incident was captured by passenger David Lawrence, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live about what happened Ryanair has been criticised for apparently failing to remove a passenger from a flight after racial abuse of a woman in her 70s. The incident, on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on Friday, was recorded by a fellow passenger and shared on social media. Many people said Ryanair should have removed the man from the flight and threatened to boycott the airline. Ryanair said it ""will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this"". It has referred the matter to Essex Police. In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - the man can be heard being racially abusive to the woman and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat. He also shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow."" After a flight attendant intervenes, the woman says she wants to sit with her daughter and tells the man he ""stinks"". She says of the passenger: ""Kick him out"". Her daughter has told The Huffington Post the row started because her mother, 77, has arthritis and it took some time for her to move out of the way for the man to get into his seat. David Lawrence, who filmed what happened, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Everything was calm, we were getting ready to take off. And then a man came on board and arrived at his seat, then spoke very harshly to a woman sitting in the aisle seat. ""That was what got my attention as it was very loud and very aggressive. He started to shout at the woman, saying 'get out of the way', 'move your feet', 'you shouldn't be sitting here'."" Ryanair said it ""would be taking the matter further"" Mr Lawrence said no attendants initially came over. The woman's daughter, who had been sitting elsewhere, arrived and ""an argument started"", he said. ""He pushed past the woman and went to his seat,"" he said, adding that what's seen in the video then unfolded - describing it as the ""most disgusting exchange of racial slurs and foul language"". The woman's daughter said she had taken her mother, a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark a year since the death of her husband. She told The Huffington Post: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was - or any other black person for that matter - police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight."" She added: ""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with."" One young man, seated in the row behind the people filmed in the video, intervened by telling the man who was shouting to stop. He has been praised for his actions. A Ryanair attendant says to the man: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down."" He then tells the older man he is going to refer the incident to his supervisor, to which the man replies: ""I'm alright."" ""I am so shocked,"" Mr Lawrence said. ""There was no response [from most other passengers]. No-one said anything. The young man who actually intervened... he was compelled to step forward."" Mr Lawrence said it was a ""horrible, horrible situation"" and that he was ""shocked"" that Ryanair ""allowed something like this just to go unchecked"". Shadow transport minister Karl Turner was among those to tweet about the incident, saying he would raise ""the tendency of airlines to ignore this kind of behaviour"". He also said ""he should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played An eyewitness describes hearing shouting in the ""disorientating"" thick fog A ferry has hit several yachts and run aground off the Isle of Wight. The Red Falcon ""came into contact"" with a number of boats while trying to berth at Cowes Harbour, operator Red Funnel said. None of the 40 passengers onboard were hurt, a spokesman said. The Coastguard confirmed nobody is missing or in the water. A member of the public had called 999 reporting cries for help from within the harbour. However, this was someone ""onboard his own vessel calling out to try and alert the master of the ferry of the situation"", the coastguard said. The ferry ran aground while entering Cowes Harbour in dense fog The mast of a boat struck by the ferry was visible in the water The vehicle ferry, which left Southampton for East Cowes at 07:00, got into difficulty an hour later while entering the harbour in low visibility. Passenger Ed Anderson, from Guildford, said: ""We got into the harbour at around 8am. We were all in our cars on the car deck when we heard it run aground. ""The captain ordered us back to the passenger deck and we were given free breakfast and drinks. ""I can see the mast of the boat we hit sticking up from the water."" Gwen Clayton was walking her dog by the water when the ferry ran aground. She said: ""You could see a maximum five metres in front of you and I heard shouting and a sort of clanging, like a metallic sound. And then nothing."" The Red Falcon ""came into contact"" with a number of boats, Red Funnel said The vessel came to a halt about 50m (165ft) off the esplanade. It has since been refloated with the assistance of tugs and has been cleared to be relocated to Southampton after coastguard surveyors completed an initial assessment. Coastguards at the scene confirmed a mast seen in the water belongs to a vessel that sank in collision with the Red Falcon. Fran Collins, Red Funnel's CEO, said: ""I would like to apologise to all passengers who have been disrupted by this incident, and emphasise that we give the safety of our passengers and crew the highest priority.""

"This video can not be played Nicole Sykes, head of EU negotiations at the CBI Businesses are becoming exasperated at the lack of progress in Brexit talks and are pausing or cancelling investment in the UK. A week that many had hoped would bring progress in the talks has now come and gone without a breakthrough. Employers group the CBI says 80% of surveyed members feel Brexit uncertainty has already had a negative impact on investment decisions. On Friday, Theresa May held a conference call with 150 top bosses. She wanted to reassure them that she was still confident of striking a deal and that she recognised their concerns. Brexit recession warning from RBS boss Lord Mervyn King attacks 'incompetent' Brexit approach Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms The chief executive of one company on the call told the BBC the PM had ""done a good job and had a reassuring tone"" while another said there had been ""nothing new in her message"". Of the members surveyed by the CBI, 39% said they would trigger additional contingency plans if there was no further clarity by November, while a further 19% said it was already too late. Nicole Sykes, the CBI's head of EU negotiations, says the situation is urgent, pointing to concrete examples of cancelled projects: ""We heard from a fashion house that wanted to set up a new factory in the UK. Â£50m of investment, cancelled. ""But we're also talking about some small things. We heard from a Northern Ireland farmer who wanted to build a new machine to make their operations more efficient, grow competitive. Again, that's been cancelled. So we really are talking about real economic consequences."" On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in London, demanding a people's vote on the final Brexit deal Despite the PM's attempts to calm nerves, many businesses are in the process of stepping up their preparations for leaving the EU without a deal at the end of March next year. Supermarket executives told the BBC they were weighing up the viability of flying in fresh food from outside the EU to avoid potential log jams at the ports like Dover. Different companies reached different conclusions. One said: ""We haven't started chartering aircraft yet but we are looking at it. We are very worried about Dover so we are also looking at alternative ports like Felixstowe as an alternative."" Another major supermarket executive said that air freight isn't the answer: ""There simply isn't the capacity at a moment when every other industry will be trying to do the same thing."" However, they felt that the problem is potentially so severe that they do not believe it will come to that. ""There is no way the UK or EU would allow the UK to run out of food, but we are looking at alternative ways to transport fresh food, as stockpiling is not an option."" Global ferry company Stena is warning that UK ports are not ready for Brexit The car industry is also very sensitive to supply chain hold-ups. Industry body the SMMT described the lack of progress in talks as hugely disappointing and said it had ""grave concerns"". Car makers are looking at alternative ports, increased warehousing and moving the supply of some parts outside the UK. BMW has alreadybrought forward an annual shutdown of Mini productionto coincide with the UK's departure from the EU, whileJaguar Land Rover has warned of the potential lossof tens of thousands of UK jobs. It's not just business which is pessimistic about a deal being struck in time. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox this week reiterated his prediction that a no deal scenario was more likely than not. ""I've said that the chance of a no deal is 60% and I'm not changing that view,"" he said. He also told a gathering of business leaders this week that great opportunities in international trade await the UK outside the EU. Most of the audience that night will hope he got the first bit wrong.

"Beckham said he and wife Victoria teach their children the importance of hard work ""Hard work"" is the key to his 19-year marriage, David Beckham has admitted. He has ""grown to ignore some of the negative stuff"" that is said about him and wife Victoria, he told Australian TV show The Sunday Project. The pair are ""proud of the family"" and teach their four children - Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper - the importance of hard work, he added. Beckham spoke to the programme before joining the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Australia for the Invictus Games. The couple attended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in Windsor ""I think if you know each other well, if you know you've got great friends and great family behind you, the thing we have to do is protect our children and we are very proud of the family,"" he said on the show. ""We are hard working and we feel that is the right way to bring up our children to prove and to show to them you have to work really hard to be successful,"" he went on. The retired footballer also touched on a recent Vogue front cover image of the Beckham clan - which he was absent from. He explained that the cover was ""all about Victoria's 10 years in fashion"". ""The amount she has achieved in such a short space of time - four beautiful young children, we have a beautiful dog - but obviously in her business world to be on the front cover of Vogue was a huge thing and then we did a separate picture for another cover,"" he said. Victoria debuts at London Fashion Week Uefa to honour former England captain Victoria Beckham receives OBE from Prince William ""But to be married for the amount of time that we have, it's always hard work, everybody knows that but you make it work.

"Beckham said he and wife Victoria teach their children the importance of hard work ""Hard work"" is the key to his 19-year marriage, David Beckham has admitted. He has ""grown to ignore some of the negative stuff"" that is said about him and wife Victoria, he told Australian TV show The Sunday Project. The pair are ""proud of the family"" and teach their four children - Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper - the importance of hard work, he added. Beckham spoke to the programme before joining the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Australia for the Invictus Games. The couple attended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in Windsor ""I think if you know each other well, if you know you've got great friends and great family behind you, the thing we have to do is protect our children and we are very proud of the family,"" he said on the show. ""We are hard working and we feel that is the right way to bring up our children to prove and to show to them you have to work really hard to be successful,"" he went on. The retired footballer also touched on a recent Vogue front cover image of the Beckham clan - which he was absent from. He explained that the cover was ""all about Victoria's 10 years in fashion"". ""The amount she has achieved in such a short space of time - four beautiful young children, we have a beautiful dog - but obviously in her business world to be on the front cover of Vogue was a huge thing and then we did a separate picture for another cover,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Nicole Sykes, head of EU negotiations at the CBI Businesses are becoming exasperated at the lack of progress in Brexit talks and are pausing or cancelling investment in the UK. A week that many had hoped would bring progress in the talks has now come and gone without a breakthrough. Employers group the CBI says 80% of surveyed members feel Brexit uncertainty has already had a negative impact on investment decisions. On Friday, Theresa May held a conference call with 150 top bosses. She wanted to reassure them that she was still confident of striking a deal and that she recognised their concerns. Brexit recession warning from RBS boss Lord Mervyn King attacks 'incompetent' Brexit approach Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms The chief executive of one company on the call told the BBC the PM had ""done a good job and had a reassuring tone"" while another said there had been ""nothing new in her message"". Of the members surveyed by the CBI, 39% said they would trigger additional contingency plans if there was no further clarity by November, while a further 19% said it was already too late. Nicole Sykes, the CBI's head of EU negotiations, says the situation is urgent, pointing to concrete examples of cancelled projects: ""We heard from a fashion house that wanted to set up a new factory in the UK. Â£50m of investment, cancelled. ""But we're also talking about some small things. We heard from a Northern Ireland farmer who wanted to build a new machine to make their operations more efficient, grow competitive. Again, that's been cancelled. So we really are talking about real economic consequences."" On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in London, demanding a people's vote on the final Brexit deal Despite the PM's attempts to calm nerves, many businesses are in the process of stepping up their preparations for leaving the EU without a deal at the end of March next year. Supermarket executives told the BBC they were weighing up the viability of flying in fresh food from outside the EU to avoid potential log jams at the ports like Dover. Different companies reached different conclusions. One said: ""We haven't started chartering aircraft yet but we are looking at it. We are very worried about Dover so we are also looking at alternative ports like Felixstowe as an alternative."" Another major supermarket executive said that air freight isn't the answer: ""There simply isn't the capacity at a moment when every other industry will be trying to do the same thing."" However, they felt that the problem is potentially so severe that they do not believe it will come to that. ""There is no way the UK or EU would allow the UK to run out of food, but we are looking at alternative ways to transport fresh food, as stockpiling is not an option."" Global ferry company Stena is warning that UK ports are not ready for Brexit The car industry is also very sensitive to supply chain hold-ups. Industry body the SMMT described the lack of progress in talks as hugely disappointing and said it had ""grave concerns"". Car makers are looking at alternative ports, increased warehousing and moving the supply of some parts outside the UK. BMW has alreadybrought forward an annual shutdown of Mini productionto coincide with the UK's departure from the EU, whileJaguar Land Rover has warned of the potential lossof tens of thousands of UK jobs. It's not just business which is pessimistic about a deal being struck in time. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox this week reiterated his prediction that a no deal scenario was more likely than not. ""I've said that the chance of a no deal is 60% and I'm not changing that view,"" he said. He also told a gathering of business leaders this week that great opportunities in international trade await the UK outside the EU. Most of the audience that night will hope he got the first bit wrong.

"This video can not be played The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station At least 18 people have been killed and 187 injured after a passenger train derailed in north-east Taiwan. Railway authorities say they are investigating the accident, which happened in Yilan County at about 16:50 local time (08:50 GMT) on Sunday. A total of 366 passengers were on the train when all eight of its carriages derailed. The incident is Taiwan's worst rail accident in 27 years. At least three children were among the dead. ""The train was going very fast. I hit a wall when the car started to flip. Around five to six people were thrown out of the carriage door,"" passenger Henry Tseng told Reuters news agency. ""There [was] no time to think what happened. Everyone was in a rush to get out."" It is not clear if any passengers remain unaccounted for - with reports providing conflicting details. The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station, near the town of Su'ao about 70km (43 miles) from Taipei. It was travelling between Taipei and the eastern county of Taitung. ""There are four carriages that were overturned at 90 degrees and the worst casualties were in those carriages,"" said Jackson Lu, director-general of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA). He had earlier told a press conference that the train was only six years old and had been in ""pretty good condition"" before the accident. It remains unclear what caused the train to derail, but witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise then sparks and smoke. Train kills dozens at Indian festival Dog dies after lead trapped in train doors at station Children in cart killed in Dutch rail crash Video footage on local television showed passengers breaking windows to escape the carriages. ""I smashed the safety glass and crawled out and I helped to pull a young man out,"" one passenger told reporters. ""There was a person sitting behind me. I'm not sure she survived."" Authorities say five of the train's eight carriages ended up on their side Another woman, Tung Xiao-ling, lost eight family members who had been returning from her sister's wedding celebration. ""No one can accept that one day you are a bride and the next day you are mourning a family member,"" Ms Tung, who was not onboard, told Reuters. An AFP news agency reporter at the scene said more bodies were being removed from the damaged carriages at about 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday night. Photographs from the scene show seats upended, with parts of the railway tracks twisted through carriage windows in places. Tsai Ing-wen has asked for a speedy investigation Taiwan's leader, Tsai Ing-wen, arrived in Xinma on Monday morning. She said she had ""asked prosecutors to clarify the situation"" and quickly determine what caused the derailment. She also met relatives of passengers affected by the disaster. ""We are really sorry... you have to stay strong,"" Ms Tsai told the mother of a seventh-grade girl who was killed in the crash.

"The Quepos area on Costa Rica's Pacific coast is popular with foreign tourists Four US tourists have died in Costa Rica after a rafting accident on a swollen river on Saturday, officials have said. A fifth person, a local tourist, is also missing. ""Fourteen tourists and three guides on board three rafts, and a kayaker, were on the Naranjito river in Quepos, Puntarenas when the accident occurred,"" Alexander Morales of the Red Cross told AFP. The victims have not yet been named. Rafting is a popular tourist activity in Costa Rica. The country is currently in its wet season, and heavy rain over its Pacific coast has flooded waterways, making water sports more dangerous.

""From our window we could see the fire,"" he said. ""It was very high flames. It was almost engulfing the whole house. ""You could see that the house was completely demolished. I was very concerned that there were people inside."" The roof of the two-storey building collapsed Mr Versi said he then walked towards the house to find the neighbours who had been evacuated.

"Any agreement to allow an extended Brexit transition should be instead of - not as well as - a ""backstop"" to avoid the return to border checks in Ireland, the Brexit secretary has said. The 21-month transition is currently expected to end on 31 December 2020 - but an extension was floated during last week's EU summit. The idea angered Leave-supporting MPs. But Dominic Raab says it should be instead of a backstop - the nature of which is also controversial. It comes afterhundreds of thousands of protesters marched through Londonon Saturday, calling for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. People's Vote march: In pictures Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Meanwhile, negotiators are at loggerheads over how best to avoid checks coming in on the Irish border after the UK leaves the EU. The UK and EU are agreed on the need for a ""transition period"" - which Theresa May calls an implementation period - designed to smooth the path between the UK leaving the EU on 29 March next year, and a new permanent relationship with the bloc, including a new trading agreement, coming into force. During that period, which ends on 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship would remain largely the same as at present. But in case there is a gap between that period ending, and a long-term UK-EU relationship coming into force, the EU has proposed that Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs union for a period to avoid the need for customs checks on the border with the Irish Republic. The UK government is opposed to this, because it would mean that Northern Ireland had a different set of rules to the rest of the UK - it argues it would effectively create a new border down the Irish Sea. Prime Minister Theresa May's alternative backstop proposal is that the whole of the UK would temporarily stay in the customs union. This video can not be played Saturday saw huge crowds march in London to demand a further EU referendum Mrs May suggested last week that the period could be extended by ""a matter of months"" if it helped to avoid a ""hard border"" with the Irish Republic. However, this angered some pro-Brexit campaigners, who said it would leave Brussels with too much power in negotiations. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Raab said there should be no ""indefinite limbo"" inside the EU's customs union. But he added: ""The prime minister has rightly refused to rule out considering different approaches - including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop. ""But we won't sacrifice Northern Ireland, and we must have finality to any backstop - whether through a time-limit or a mechanism that enables the UK to leave, in case the EU doesn't live up to its promise to get the future relationship in place swiftly."" It comes as aformer Brexit minister is trying to put a legal barrierin the way of the EU's backstop plan by requiring the approval of the Stormont Assembly. Northern Ireland's devolved government has not sat since power-sharing collapsed in January 2017. And on Saturday,an estimated 700,000 people marched through central Londonto demand a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who started the march - was among those who addressed a rally in Parliament Square, along with representatives from the main political parties. Celebrity speakers included Steve Coogan, Delia Smith and Deborah Meaden. At the same time, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage led a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He said: ""The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it. ""And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to.""

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Now is the time to play for the team"" The Brexit Secretary has said he understands Tory ""jitters"" about EU negotiations but urged MPs to hold their nerve as talks continue. ""The end is in sight in terms of a good deal, the prize we want,"" Dominic Raab said, asking them to ""wait and see"". It comes amid newspaper speculation that Theresa May could face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs. On Saturday, protesters marched through London to call for a public vote on whatever Brexit deal is negotiated. Raab: Longer transition or backstop - not both Commons bid to block Brexit 'backstop' People's Vote march: In pictures Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Some Tory MPs were angered last week by a suggestion that the post-Brexit ""transition period"" - designed to smooth the path between the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 and a future long-term relationship with Brussels - could be extended. Ex-Tory leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that would see the UK paying the EU ""tens of billions"" more and he said the negotiations ""look more like a capitulation"". Moray MP Douglas Rosssaid Scotland's 13 Conservative MPs would not support a dealif the UK remained part of the Common Fisheries Policy beyond 2020. And Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgentold the Mail on Sunday,externalTheresa May was ""drinking in the last chance saloon"" and must attend a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers this week. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that he was ""open minded"" about the possibility of extending the transition period - which the government calls the implementation period - for about ""three months or so"" if needed, as long as it was clear how the UK would get out of it, to avoid ""any sense that we are left indefinitely in a sort of customs union limbo"". Please upgrade your browser He said: ""I think it's understandable there are jitters on all sides of this debate and we need to hold our nerve. The end is in sight in terms of a good deal - the prize we want - a good deal with the EU and I think colleagues should wait and see what that looks like."" He added: ""We won't want to bring something back which we aren't confident is a very good deal for the United Kingdom.  But now is the time to play for the team, I think that's the way we get the best deal for the EU and I also think that's what the country expects from us."" Asked if, realistically, the withdrawal agreement could still be being negotiated after November, he replied: ""I think if it went any distance beyond that we would have a problem with implementing the deal, and it would almost be the worst-case scenario - we'd have a deal but couldn't implement it in time."" This video can not be played Saturday saw huge crowds march in London to demand a further EU referendum Meanwhile Brexit minister Suella Braverman has told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics that she supports the prime minister, but refused to say whether she would back her in a confidence vote. She said: ""I don't think there will be a vote of confidence in the prime minister and I am supporting the prime minister unequivocally and I want her to get on with the job to deliver Brexit and I know that she will be doing that."" The UK voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. It is due to leave on 29 March 2019 but during the post-Brexit ""transition period"", set to run until 31 December 2020, the UK-EU relationship will stay largely the same. If at the end of that period, a long-term ""future relationship"", including trade deal, is not ready, both sides have agreed on the need for provisions to ensure there is no need for customs checks - a ""hard border"" - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in the interim period. This is called the ""backstop"" - but the two sides have yet to agree on what form it should take and how long it could last. This video can not be played Keir Starmer: If a deal is made by the end of the year, it won't last On Saturday,protesters took part in a huge march to London's Parliament Square to call for another referendum- this time on any final Brexit deal that is negotiated. Organisers say it attracted about 700,000 people. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the march reflected ""a much bigger group, both Leave and Remain [voters], who are utterly losing confidence in the prime minister's ability"" to bring back a good deal. Asked if Labour MPs would back Mrs May in Parliament, rather than risk a ""no deal"" exit from the EU, he said: ""We do not accept this proposition it's that or no deal, and it's not just us. There's a huge majority in Parliament that will not accept that the alternative to Theresa May's deal, if there is one, is no deal."" He added: ""I don't think anybody thinks this 30-year civil war in the Tory party on Europe is going to end before Christmas. ""What we're going to see is even if there's a deal, the Tory party will try to rip it up next year... They will not stop fighting about this. ""We've got to the very serious situation where people are saying 'Is this government actually capable of delivering because it's so divided?'."" There has been criticism of the language reported from unnamed Tory sources about Mrs May's future as Conservative leader about her entering the ""killing zone"" and telling her to ""bring your own noose"".

"This video can not be played Nicole Sykes, head of EU negotiations at the CBI Businesses are becoming exasperated at the lack of progress in Brexit talks and are pausing or cancelling investment in the UK. A week that many had hoped would bring progress in the talks has now come and gone without a breakthrough. Employers group the CBI says 80% of surveyed members feel Brexit uncertainty has already had a negative impact on investment decisions. On Friday, Theresa May held a conference call with 150 top bosses. She wanted to reassure them that she was still confident of striking a deal and that she recognised their concerns. Brexit recession warning from RBS boss Lord Mervyn King attacks 'incompetent' Brexit approach Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms The chief executive of one company on the call told the BBC the PM had ""done a good job and had a reassuring tone"" while another said there had been ""nothing new in her message"". Of the members surveyed by the CBI, 39% said they would trigger additional contingency plans if there was no further clarity by November, while a further 19% said it was already too late. Nicole Sykes, the CBI's head of EU negotiations, says the situation is urgent, pointing to concrete examples of cancelled projects: ""We heard from a fashion house that wanted to set up a new factory in the UK. Â£50m of investment, cancelled. ""But we're also talking about some small things. We heard from a Northern Ireland farmer who wanted to build a new machine to make their operations more efficient, grow competitive. Again, that's been cancelled. So we really are talking about real economic consequences."" On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in London, demanding a people's vote on the final Brexit deal Despite the PM's attempts to calm nerves, many businesses are in the process of stepping up their preparations for leaving the EU without a deal at the end of March next year. Supermarket executives told the BBC they were weighing up the viability of flying in fresh food from outside the EU to avoid potential log jams at the ports like Dover. Different companies reached different conclusions. One said: ""We haven't started chartering aircraft yet but we are looking at it. We are very worried about Dover so we are also looking at alternative ports like Felixstowe as an alternative."" Another major supermarket executive said that air freight isn't the answer: ""There simply isn't the capacity at a moment when every other industry will be trying to do the same thing."" However, they felt that the problem is potentially so severe that they do not believe it will come to that. ""There is no way the UK or EU would allow the UK to run out of food, but we are looking at alternative ways to transport fresh food, as stockpiling is not an option."" Global ferry company Stena is warning that UK ports are not ready for Brexit The car industry is also very sensitive to supply chain hold-ups. Industry body the SMMT described the lack of progress in talks as hugely disappointing and said it had ""grave concerns"". Car makers are looking at alternative ports, increased warehousing and moving the supply of some parts outside the UK. BMW has alreadybrought forward an annual shutdown of Mini productionto coincide with the UK's departure from the EU, whileJaguar Land Rover has warned of the potential lossof tens of thousands of UK jobs. It's not just business which is pessimistic about a deal being struck in time. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox this week reiterated his prediction that a no deal scenario was more likely than not. ""I've said that the chance of a no deal is 60% and I'm not changing that view,"" he said. He also told a gathering of business leaders this week that great opportunities in international trade await the UK outside the EU. Most of the audience that night will hope he got the first bit wrong.

"This video can not be played The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station At least 18 people have been killed and 187 injured after a passenger train derailed in north-east Taiwan. Railway authorities say they are investigating the accident, which happened in Yilan County at about 16:50 local time (08:50 GMT) on Sunday. A total of 366 passengers were on the train when all eight of its carriages derailed. The incident is Taiwan's worst rail accident in 27 years. At least three children were among the dead. ""The train was going very fast. I hit a wall when the car started to flip. Around five to six people were thrown out of the carriage door,"" passenger Henry Tseng told Reuters news agency. ""There [was] no time to think what happened. Everyone was in a rush to get out."" It is not clear if any passengers remain unaccounted for - with reports providing conflicting details. The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station, near the town of Su'ao about 70km (43 miles) from Taipei. It was travelling between Taipei and the eastern county of Taitung. ""There are four carriages that were overturned at 90 degrees and the worst casualties were in those carriages,"" said Jackson Lu, director-general of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA). He had earlier told a press conference that the train was only six years old and had been in ""pretty good condition"" before the accident. It remains unclear what caused the train to derail, but witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise then sparks and smoke. Train kills dozens at Indian festival Dog dies after lead trapped in train doors at station Children in cart killed in Dutch rail crash Video footage on local television showed passengers breaking windows to escape the carriages. ""I smashed the safety glass and crawled out and I helped to pull a young man out,"" one passenger told reporters. ""There was a person sitting behind me. I'm not sure she survived."" Authorities say five of the train's eight carriages ended up on their side Another woman, Tung Xiao-ling, lost eight family members who had been returning from her sister's wedding celebration. ""No one can accept that one day you are a bride and the next day you are mourning a family member,"" Ms Tung, who was not onboard, told Reuters. An AFP news agency reporter at the scene said more bodies were being removed from the damaged carriages at about 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday night. Photographs from the scene show seats upended, with parts of the railway tracks twisted through carriage windows in places. Tsai Ing-wen has asked for a speedy investigation Taiwan's leader, Tsai Ing-wen, arrived in Xinma on Monday morning. She said she had ""asked prosecutors to clarify the situation"" and quickly determine what caused the derailment. She also met relatives of passengers affected by the disaster. ""We are really sorry... you have to stay strong,"" Ms Tsai told the mother of a seventh-grade girl who was killed in the crash.

""We have experienced a pretty severe amount of backlash in the form of hate mail and death threats,"" Dakota said. However the previous rituals aimed at Mr Trump, they say, have proved successful. ""We feel the rituals were a success as they sought to expose Trump for what he is, and that has happened on many levels; from the Russia probe to the exposÃ© on his finances to Stormy Daniels [the porn actress who says she had a sexual affair with Mr Trump in 2006].""

"This video can not be played The incident was captured by passenger David Lawrence, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live about what happened Ryanair has been criticised for apparently failing to remove a passenger from a flight after racial abuse of a woman in her 70s. The incident, on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on Friday, was recorded by a fellow passenger and shared on social media. Many people said Ryanair should have removed the man from the flight and threatened to boycott the airline. Ryanair said it ""will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this"". It has referred the matter to Essex Police. In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - the man can be heard being racially abusive to the woman and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat. He also shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow."" After a flight attendant intervenes, the woman says she wants to sit with her daughter and tells the man he ""stinks"". She says of the passenger: ""Kick him out"". Her daughter has told The Huffington Post the row started because her mother, 77, has arthritis and it took some time for her to move out of the way for the man to get into his seat. David Lawrence, who filmed what happened, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Everything was calm, we were getting ready to take off. And then a man came on board and arrived at his seat, then spoke very harshly to a woman sitting in the aisle seat. ""That was what got my attention as it was very loud and very aggressive. He started to shout at the woman, saying 'get out of the way', 'move your feet', 'you shouldn't be sitting here'."" Ryanair said it ""would be taking the matter further"" Mr Lawrence said no attendants initially came over. The woman's daughter, who had been sitting elsewhere, arrived and ""an argument started"", he said. ""He pushed past the woman and went to his seat,"" he said, adding that what's seen in the video then unfolded - describing it as the ""most disgusting exchange of racial slurs and foul language"". The woman's daughter said she had taken her mother, a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark a year since the death of her husband. She told The Huffington Post: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was - or any other black person for that matter - police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight."" She added: ""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with."" One young man, seated in the row behind the people filmed in the video, intervened by telling the man who was shouting to stop. He has been praised for his actions. A Ryanair attendant says to the man: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down."" He then tells the older man he is going to refer the incident to his supervisor, to which the man replies: ""I'm alright."" ""I am so shocked,"" Mr Lawrence said. ""There was no response [from most other passengers]. No-one said anything. The young man who actually intervened... he was compelled to step forward."" Mr Lawrence said it was a ""horrible, horrible situation"" and that he was ""shocked"" that Ryanair ""allowed something like this just to go unchecked"". Shadow transport minister Karl Turner was among those to tweet about the incident, saying he would raise ""the tendency of airlines to ignore this kind of behaviour"". He also said ""he should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Critics of the incident and how it was handled said the man should have been removed - rather than the woman herself moving seats. Ryanair told the BBC: ""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this. ""We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel."" Essex Police said on Sunday: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport. ""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation."" It asked anyone with information to call 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. The Department for Transport said ""everyone should be able to enjoy a safe and calm journey without their flight being spoilt by a disruptive minority"". The DfT said it would work with airlines and airports ""to look at what more can be done to deal with disruptive passengers"". Why we're fighting misogynoir.

"Cerys Cliff and Alfie Evans were behind the idea and will lead the production of Stationary Bike - which appeared in the Just After Sunset collection of short stories A Stephen King story is set to be turned into a film in Tredegar - adding to its growing reputation for supernatural and horror movies. The Stationary Bike, published byThe Shining and Misery author,externalin 2003, will be adapted for the screen and filmed around the town. Blaenau Gwent Film Academy said gaining King's permission was ""a great scoop"". A similar deal helped pave the way for a young filmmaker to direct critically-acclaimed The Shawshank Redemption. The news follows a local production companywinning awards for Polish-Welsh film The Benchwhile a ""blood splattered"" horror has just been completed, which has its first screening over Halloween. Valleys film shot in Polish town up for major awards 'Wolf-like creatures' stalk Bedwellty House for horror film ""Being given an opportunity to bring one of Stephen King's novels to life is crazy,"" said 16-year-old Alfie Evans who will work on the script along with GCSE drama student Cerys Cliff, 14. Set up in 2017, the not-for-profit film academy aims to train hundreds of youngsters a year in script writing, filming and editing to turn the area into a creative hub. The Blaenau Gwent Film Academy works with children aged seven to 18 in schools and other young aspiring filmmakers The Stationary Bike is about an artist cycling to lose weight after being told he has dangerously high cholesterol and entering a trance, where he experiences nightmarish scenarios. After writing to King, his officials wrote back and offered the academy a Dollar Baby contract to produce a film version. This is where permission is given in return for US $1. King previously explained: ""Around 1977 or so, when I started having some popular success, I saw a way to give back a little of the joy the movies had given me."" Knight of the Blood Moon was filmed at Tredegar's Bedwellty House While he is believed to watch them all, because they are not meant to be sold commercially, only about 10 are known to have been made between 1977 and 1996. Since 2000, King has granted permission for a number to be released. Budgets have ranged from $100 (Â£75) to $60,000 (Â£45,475), with the exposure seen as providing a huge career springboard. For example, Frank Darabont made The Woman in the Room on a Dollar Baby contract, aged 20 in 1986. On the back of this, he directed the critically acclaimed Stephen King films The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Knight of the Blood Moon was likened to films including Friday the 13th and The Blair Witch Project by academy tutors The Blaenau Gwent Film Academy's first production - Knight of the Blood Moon - has just been finished after costing Â£10,000 and taking local youngsters five months to write, film and edit. Tutor Kevin Phillips called it a ""blood splattering feast"", adding: ""Likable characters will have you rooting for their survival in this blood bath of mayhem. ""With no escape, a monster with no remorse, no pity, and a craving for blood is upon them, a vicious game of cat and mouse begins.""

"Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord The US will withdraw from a landmark nuclear weapons treaty with Russia, President Donald Trump has confirmed. Speaking to reporters, Mr Trump said Russia had ""violated"" the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The deal banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles). The US would not let Russia ""go out and do weapons [while] we're not allowed to"", Mr Trump said. ""I don't know why President [Barack] Obama didn't negotiate or pull out,"" the president said after a campaign rally in Nevada. ""They've been violating it for many years."" In 2014,President Obama accused Russia of breaching the INFafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. A Russian foreign ministry source said the US move was motivated by a ""dream of a unipolar world"" where it is the only global superpower, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles Analysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Concern about Russia's development and deployment of a missile system that breaches the INF treaty predates the Trump administration. But the president's decision to walk away from the agreement marks a significant setback for arms control. Many experts believe that negotiations should have continued to try to bring the Russians back into compliance. It is, they fear, part of the wider unravelling of the whole system of arms control treaties that helped to curb strategic competition during the Cold War. Other factors too may have played into President Trump's decision. This was a bilateral treaty between Washington and Moscow. China was free to develop and deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles. Some in the Trump administration feel that the INF treaty places them at a growing disadvantage in their developing  strategic rivalry with Beijing . The US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8. It would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Russia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. The New York Times reported on Fridaythe US was considering withdrawing from the treaty in a bid to counter China's expanding military presence,externalin the western Pacific. The country was not a signatory of the deal, allowing it to develop medium-range missiles without restraint. National Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to tell the Russians of the withdrawal during talks in Moscow later this week. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed. Both countries were allowed to inspect the others installations In 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests. The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016.

"Mr Gorbachev has questioned the sense of withdrawing from the INF Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says US President Trump's plan to withdraw from a key Cold War nuclear weapons treaty is a reversal of efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament. Mr Gorbachev - who signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with President Reagan in 1987 - questioned the plan's intelligence. Mr Trump said Russia had been ""violating [the INF] for many years"". Russia has condemned the plans and threatened to retaliate. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would be seeking an explanation from visiting US National Security Adviser John Bolton. Germany was the first US ally to criticise the move, with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urging Washington to consider the consequences both for Europe and for future disarmament efforts. The INF banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles). Mr Gorbachev and Mr Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 It was signed near the end of the Cold War, a period of relations between the US and the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1989 marked by intense international tension and overshadowed by the threat of nuclear conflict. In the past five decades the US and Russia have signed a range of joint agreements to limit and reduce their substantial nuclear arsenals.

""This would be a very dangerous step that, I'm sure, not only will not be comprehended by the international community but will provoke serious condemnation,"" Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. The treaty is ""significant for international security and security in the sphere of nuclear arms, for the maintenance of strategic stability,"" he told state news agency Tass. The minister also told the news agency RIA Novosti that if the US continued to behave ""clumsily and crudely"" and backed out of international agreements, ""then we will have no choice but to undertake retaliatory measures, including involving military technology"". ""But we would not want to get to this stage,"" he added.

"This video can not be played An eyewitness describes hearing shouting in the ""disorientating"" thick fog A ferry has hit several yachts and run aground off the Isle of Wight. The Red Falcon ""came into contact"" with a number of boats while trying to berth at Cowes Harbour, operator Red Funnel said. None of the 40 passengers onboard were hurt, a spokesman said. The Coastguard confirmed nobody is missing or in the water. A member of the public had called 999 reporting cries for help from within the harbour. However, this was someone ""onboard his own vessel calling out to try and alert the master of the ferry of the situation"", the coastguard said. The ferry ran aground while entering Cowes Harbour in dense fog The mast of a boat struck by the ferry was visible in the water The vehicle ferry, which left Southampton for East Cowes at 07:00, got into difficulty an hour later while entering the harbour in low visibility. Passenger Ed Anderson, from Guildford, said: ""We got into the harbour at around 8am. We were all in our cars on the car deck when we heard it run aground. ""The captain ordered us back to the passenger deck and we were given free breakfast and drinks. ""I can see the mast of the boat we hit sticking up from the water."" Gwen Clayton was walking her dog by the water when the ferry ran aground. She said: ""You could see a maximum five metres in front of you and I heard shouting and a sort of clanging, like a metallic sound. And then nothing."" The Red Falcon ""came into contact"" with a number of boats, Red Funnel said The vessel came to a halt about 50m (165ft) off the esplanade. It has since been refloated with the assistance of tugs and has been cleared to be relocated to Southampton after coastguard surveyors completed an initial assessment. Coastguards at the scene confirmed a mast seen in the water belongs to a vessel that sank in collision with the Red Falcon. Fran Collins, Red Funnel's CEO, said: ""I would like to apologise to all passengers who have been disrupted by this incident, and emphasise that we give the safety of our passengers and crew the highest priority.""

""We have experienced a pretty severe amount of backlash in the form of hate mail and death threats,"" Dakota said. However the previous rituals aimed at Mr Trump, they say, have proved successful. ""We feel the rituals were a success as they sought to expose Trump for what he is, and that has happened on many levels; from the Russia probe to the exposÃ© on his finances to Stormy Daniels [the porn actress who says she had a sexual affair with Mr Trump in 2006].""

"Steve Bannon left his White House job amid reports of a power struggle Nicola Sturgeon has pulled out of a conference in Edinburgh next month because Donald Trump's ex-strategist Steve Bannon was also due to speak. The first minister had been scheduled to take part in the three-day News Xchange event, which is being co-hosted by the BBC, on 13 November. However, she said that giving Mr Bannon a platform risked ""legitimising or normalising far-right, racist views"". Steve Bannon was one of Donald Trump's most trusted aides until August 2017. He left the US government after losing his seat on the National Security Council amid claims of a power struggle among President Trump's top team. Since leaving the White House, Mr Bannon has continued to champion right-wing political causes, although his appearance at events has proved controversial. In September he was disinvited from the New Yorker Festivalafter a high-profile backlash by actor Jim Carrey, producer Judd Apatow and presenter Jimmy Fallon. Nicola Sturgeon said Steve Bannon's inclusion in the event risked normalising far-right views. Nicola Sturgeon was due to be introduced by the BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith on the opening evening of the conference on 13 November. Steve Bannon is expected to take part in a session the next morning, which is also due to be moderated by Sarah Smith at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre. In a tweet, Ms Sturgeon said she regretted the position she had been put in by the BBC. She said: ""I believe passionately in free speech but as @ScotGovFM I have to make balanced judgments - and I will not be part of any process that risks legitimising or normalising far right, racist views. I regret that the BBC has put me and others in this position."" She also attacked the event's description of Mr Bannon as a ""powerful and influential figure...promoting an anti-elite movement."" She added: ""This kind of language to describe views that many would describe as fascist does seem to me to run the risk of normalisation."" The event is due to be moderated by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith In a statement the BBC said Steve Bannon had been invited on behalf of the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) News Xchange committee. They added: ""Good journalism in a world of fake news and disinformation is more vital than ever. ""Journalism is about asking tough questions and understanding what is happening in the world and why. ""A conference designed to analyse the big issues impacting that world isn't an endorsement of anyone or anything - it is a function of what journalism is.""

"Cerys Cliff and Alfie Evans were behind the idea and will lead the production of Stationary Bike - which appeared in the Just After Sunset collection of short stories A Stephen King story is set to be turned into a film in Tredegar - adding to its growing reputation for supernatural and horror movies. The Stationary Bike, published byThe Shining and Misery author,externalin 2003, will be adapted for the screen and filmed around the town. Blaenau Gwent Film Academy said gaining King's permission was ""a great scoop"". A similar deal helped pave the way for a young filmmaker to direct critically-acclaimed The Shawshank Redemption. The news follows a local production companywinning awards for Polish-Welsh film The Benchwhile a ""blood splattered"" horror has just been completed, which has its first screening over Halloween. Valleys film shot in Polish town up for major awards 'Wolf-like creatures' stalk Bedwellty House for horror film ""Being given an opportunity to bring one of Stephen King's novels to life is crazy,"" said 16-year-old Alfie Evans who will work on the script along with GCSE drama student Cerys Cliff, 14. Set up in 2017, the not-for-profit film academy aims to train hundreds of youngsters a year in script writing, filming and editing to turn the area into a creative hub. The Blaenau Gwent Film Academy works with children aged seven to 18 in schools and other young aspiring filmmakers The Stationary Bike is about an artist cycling to lose weight after being told he has dangerously high cholesterol and entering a trance, where he experiences nightmarish scenarios. After writing to King, his officials wrote back and offered the academy a Dollar Baby contract to produce a film version. This is where permission is given in return for US $1. King previously explained: ""Around 1977 or so, when I started having some popular success, I saw a way to give back a little of the joy the movies had given me."" Knight of the Blood Moon was filmed at Tredegar's Bedwellty House While he is believed to watch them all, because they are not meant to be sold commercially, only about 10 are known to have been made between 1977 and 1996. Since 2000, King has granted permission for a number to be released. Budgets have ranged from $100 (Â£75) to $60,000 (Â£45,475), with the exposure seen as providing a huge career springboard. For example, Frank Darabont made The Woman in the Room on a Dollar Baby contract, aged 20 in 1986. On the back of this, he directed the critically acclaimed Stephen King films The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Knight of the Blood Moon was likened to films including Friday the 13th and The Blair Witch Project by academy tutors The Blaenau Gwent Film Academy's first production - Knight of the Blood Moon - has just been finished after costing Â£10,000 and taking local youngsters five months to write, film and edit. Tutor Kevin Phillips called it a ""blood splattering feast"", adding: ""Likable characters will have you rooting for their survival in this blood bath of mayhem. ""With no escape, a monster with no remorse, no pity, and a craving for blood is upon them, a vicious game of cat and mouse begins."" It will have its premiere in Tredegar's Little Theatre over Halloween while it has been entered in a number of film festivals.

"Independent candidate Dr Kerryn Phelps pictured after her poll victory in Sydney Australia's governing coalition has lost its one-seat parliamentary majority after a by-election in Sydney. Kerryn Phelps, a local doctor and popular independent candidate, comfortably won the Wentworth seat. ""This win tonight should signal a return of decency, integrity and humanity to the Australian government,"" she told supporters. Australia has had six prime ministers in eight years, and now faces further uncertainty. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's ruling Liberal Party had been fighting to hold Wentworth, which was vacated by his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. The result means the centre-right party will need to rely on independent MPs to survive confidence votes. Two have already vowed not to back Mr Morrison. Malcolm Turnbull ousted in brutal party coup The rise of Scott Morrison, Australia's new PM Australians vent about political chaos This video can not be played Why Australia has had so many prime ministers Speaking at the HQ of Liberal candidate Dave Sharma, Mr Morrison said it had been a ""tough day"" and the result was ""not unexpected"". ""Liberals are angry and they've expressed that,"" he said. ""We will work constructively with all of those on the crossbench, as we always have... The Liberal-National government will be back at work on Monday."" Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney Revenge. The people of Wentworth have sent a blunt message to Australia's political class that back-stabbing and party dysfunction won't be tolerated. The defeat of Dave Sharma, the governing Liberal candidate in the Sydney by-election, is an act of retribution by voters furious and frustrated at the ruthless ousting as prime minister of their beloved former MP, Malcolm Turnbull. Scott Morrison has failed his first electoral test as PM and more trouble is brewing. Liberal Party candidate Dave Sharma could not fight off independent Kerryn Phelps The lightning and thunder that jolted Bondi Beach and other parts of Wentworth as the polls closed are a sign of a wild political ride that lies ahead. The Morrison government has lost its narrow parliamentary majority, but it should survive, for now at least, with the support of independent MPs. However, with an election due next May its longer-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Controversy was stoked during the by-election race by the prime minister's proposal thatAustralia could follow the US and move its embassy to Jerusalem. Mr Sharma is the former Australian ambassador to Israel and first proposed such a move. Around 13% of Wentworth's voters are Jewish, compared to less than 0.5% of the Australian population as a whole. The US moved its embassy to Jerusalem in May Kerryn Phelps has said any decision on recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital must take into account trade, security and defence considerations.

"Steve Baker urged the prime minister to change her Brexit plan earlier this month A Tory ex-minister is trying to put a block on the EU's controversial proposals for a ""backstop"" to guarantee no hard Irish border after Brexit. Steve Baker has put down amendments to the Northern Ireland bill, which is to be discussed in Parliament next week. He wants to make it a legal requirement to get the Stormont Assembly's approval for any plan to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. But the devolved government has not sat since power-sharing collapsed in 2017. The bill aims to give its civil servants greater flexibility in making decisions, in the absence of government. However, it has drawn the attention of those arguing over plans for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. Politicians criticise NI secretary's bill Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Both the EU and UK are signed up to the need for a ""backstop"" - effectively an insurance policy to avoid the introduction of checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - which is an EU member - after Brexit. During the ""transition period"" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 until 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship with the EU will stay largely the same - something designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship between them. But if there is a gap between the transition period ending, and the ""future relationship"" coming into force, the backstop would ensure no hard border in the meantime. The EU and UK are agreed there can be no return to a hard border - but disagree over how the backstop should operate. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The government has proposed a backstop which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period, until a comprehensive agreement is reached. Under the EU's idea of a contingency plan, Northern Ireland would remain in the EU's customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system - something the UK says is unacceptable as it would create a new border down the Irish Sea, between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mr Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe and deputy chairman of the Conservative pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs. said his amendments would ensure that ""emergency powers"" could not be used to implement measures in the absence of an assembly. ""Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK."" ""Creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, creating a separate regulatory regime or imposing EU laws on Northern Ireland via emergency legislation does not respect Northern Ireland's status in the UK."" Karen Bradley will table the Northen Ireland bill and believes it will provide an opportunity to restart political talks BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said it was unclear what level of support there was for the amendments. ""But negotiators may not welcome any attempt to impose legal limits on the talks which are already at an impasse,"" she added. A government statement said the Northern Ireland bill is intended to provide civil servants with the ""certainty and clarity"" they needed to deliver public services. ""It enables key appointments that cannot currently be made in the absence of Northern Ireland ministers to be made during the period before an executive is next formed,"" the statement added. ""The bill also creates the necessary time and space to restart political talks with the aim of restoring devolved government as soon as possible.""

"Any agreement to allow an extended Brexit transition should be instead of - not as well as - a ""backstop"" to avoid the return to border checks in Ireland, the Brexit secretary has said. The 21-month transition is currently expected to end on 31 December 2020 - but an extension was floated during last week's EU summit. The idea angered Leave-supporting MPs. But Dominic Raab says it should be instead of a backstop - the nature of which is also controversial. It comes afterhundreds of thousands of protesters marched through Londonon Saturday, calling for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. People's Vote march: In pictures Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Meanwhile, negotiators are at loggerheads over how best to avoid checks coming in on the Irish border after the UK leaves the EU. The UK and EU are agreed on the need for a ""transition period"" - which Theresa May calls an implementation period - designed to smooth the path between the UK leaving the EU on 29 March next year, and a new permanent relationship with the bloc, including a new trading agreement, coming into force. During that period, which ends on 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship would remain largely the same as at present. But in case there is a gap between that period ending, and a long-term UK-EU relationship coming into force, the EU has proposed that Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs union for a period to avoid the need for customs checks on the border with the Irish Republic. The UK government is opposed to this, because it would mean that Northern Ireland had a different set of rules to the rest of the UK - it argues it would effectively create a new border down the Irish Sea. Prime Minister Theresa May's alternative backstop proposal is that the whole of the UK would temporarily stay in the customs union. This video can not be played Saturday saw huge crowds march in London to demand a further EU referendum Mrs May suggested last week that the period could be extended by ""a matter of months"" if it helped to avoid a ""hard border"" with the Irish Republic. However, this angered some pro-Brexit campaigners, who said it would leave Brussels with too much power in negotiations. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Raab said there should be no ""indefinite limbo"" inside the EU's customs union. But he added: ""The prime minister has rightly refused to rule out considering different approaches - including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop. ""But we won't sacrifice Northern Ireland, and we must have finality to any backstop - whether through a time-limit or a mechanism that enables the UK to leave, in case the EU doesn't live up to its promise to get the future relationship in place swiftly."" It comes as aformer Brexit minister is trying to put a legal barrierin the way of the EU's backstop plan by requiring the approval of the Stormont Assembly. Northern Ireland's devolved government has not sat since power-sharing collapsed in January 2017. And on Saturday,an estimated 700,000 people marched through central Londonto demand a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who started the march - was among those who addressed a rally in Parliament Square, along with representatives from the main political parties. Celebrity speakers included Steve Coogan, Delia Smith and Deborah Meaden. At the same time, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage led a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He said: ""The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it. ""And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to.""

"This video can not be played A blaze caused by the explosion took hours to control (Credit: Ahmed J Versi) A woman has died in a suspected gas explosion in north-west London. Her body was found in a first-floor flat destroyed in the blast in Fulbeck Way, Harrow, just before 01:00 BST Sunday. Another woman, a man and a baby were rescued from a second-floor flat, with the woman and child taken to hospital. About 70 firefighters tackled the flames and 40 neighbours were evacuated from their homes. The Met is investigating. The victim, believed to be in her 80s, has not yet been formally identified. Officers are in the process of finding her next-of-kin. Rahman Alanezi, who lives nearby, said: ""Everyone was screaming that there was a baby inside and they took him out."" Police said the woman and baby ""are expected to be fine"" after being treated for smoke inhalation. The first-floor flat in Fulbeck Way, Harrow, was destroyed A woman was pronounced dead at the scene The London Fire Brigade said it was working with police to establish the cause of the blast but that ""a gas explosion is suspected"". ""The first floor partially collapsed due to the force of the explosion,"" it said. Police and firefighters are investigating the cause of the explosion Alan Taylor, the brigade's borough commander for Harrow, added: ""When crews arrived they were faced with a well-developed fire. ""Crews worked really hard and they rescued two adults and one child using a nine metre ladder."" Ahmed Versi, 69, lives in a nearby street and was awoken by sirens. ""From our window we could see the fire,"" he said. ""It was very high flames. It was almost engulfing the whole house. ""You could see that the house was completely demolished. I was very concerned that there were people inside."" The roof of the two-storey building collapsed Mr Versi said he then walked towards the house to find the neighbours who had been evacuated. ""Everybody was just standing there silently watching what was happening. I think they were all shocked,"" he said. On hearing a woman died in the explosion, he added: ""It's severely sad to hear what has happened - such pain for the family members."" Harrow Council said it helped one person who was evacuated to book into a hotel. Others have found places to stay themselves, a spokesman added. Navin Shah, London Assembly member for Brent and Harrow, said the death was ""tragic news"". On Twitter,external, he added: ""Heart goes out to the victims & affected residents."" Ten fire engines were sent to the scene and a 20m cordon was put in place. The blaze was brought under control after two-and-a-half hours. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.

"The Â£50 note is getting a plastic redesign - and a new famous face. Steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton appear on the current Â£50, issued in 2011. The Bank of England will be seeking nominations from the public for figures to feature on the note. So who are the contenders? Princess Anne unveiled a statue of Noor Inayat Khan in London's Gordon Square Gardens on 2012 Who:Raised in Britain and France and a descendant of Indian royalty, Noor Inayat Khan was a secret agent for Britain during World War Two. Records show she was the first female wireless operator sent to Nazi-occupied France during the war, aged just 29. She evaded capture for three months but was eventually arrested and imprisoned by the Nazis. Despite suffering months of torture she refused to reveal any information and was transferred to Dachau concentration camp in Germany, where she was killed in 1944. The Indian royal who became a spy Why:A petition supporting Noor Inayat Khan has already attracted more than 1,300 signatures, with supporters including Conservative MP and former Army officer Tom Tugendhat and historian and BBC presenter Dan Snow. No UK banknote has ever featured a person from an ethnic minority and the petition calls for the ""remarkable"" woman's bravery to be recognised as an example of the ""positive contributions"" of Muslims to Britain. Odds:16/1 Who:Mary Seacole was a Jamaican-born nurse who cared for wounded British soldiers during the Crimean War. In 1854 she travelled to England and approached the War Office, asking to be sent as an Army nurse to the Crimea, but was refused. Undaunted, Seacole funded the trip herself and established the British Hotel near Balaclava to provide food, supplies and medicines to troops as well as nursing the wounded on the battlefield. Why:Many have argued that in the past Mary Seacole's work has been overshadowed by her contemporary Florence Nightingale, who was also a nurse during the Crimean War. However in 2004, Seacole was voted the greatest black Briton and her achievements against a backdrop of discrimination in the 19th Century are becoming more widely recognised.In 2016 a memorial statue was unveiledin London in her honour and Labour MP David Lammy praised the fact her ""pioneering work"" had ""finally been recognised"". Odds:10/1 Who:The British physicist died earlier this year aged 76 and is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of his generation. At the age of 22 Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. But despite his illness he completed groundbreaking work on black holes and relativity throughout his career. Obituary: Stephen Hawking Why:Hawking's book A Brief History of Time was an unlikely best-seller and he became a popular ambassador for science. He was even depicted in an episode of The Simpsons. The physicist's achievements have been recognised with numerous medals and awards, and following his death in March, he is among the favourites to be given the posthumous honour. Odds:16/1 Who:Clement Attlee was leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. He served as deputy prime minister in Winston Churchill's coalition government and was then prime minister from 1945 to 1951. His government introduced the National Health Service, nationalised one-fifth of the British economy, including the coal and steel industry, and granted independence to India. Why:His administration is often credited with founding the modern welfare state, and in the NHS's 70th birthday year, a tribute to the man who oversaw its introduction may seem fitting. Odds:10/1 Who:Margaret Thatcher occupied 10 Downing Street as Conservative leader and prime minister from 1979 to 1990. She was both the UK's first female PM and the country's longest-serving leader of the 20th Century. Her policies gave thousands of people the chance to buy their council houses and snap up shares in newly-privatised industries like British Gas and BT. She died in 2013 after suffering a stroke. Obituary: Margaret Thatcher Why:Despite being a divisive figure, Margaret Thatcher is widely considered one of the most influential political figures of the 20th Century. A petition calling for her to be chosen as the new face of the Â£50 note has attracted more than 12,000 signatures. With just one of the UK's banknotes featuring a woman other than the Queen, the petition argues there would be no-one more appropriate to feature than the country's first female prime minister. Odds?16/1 Among the more original suggestions isa picture of England defender Harry Maguire riding an inflatable unicorn. The idea was proposed by sports journalist Jonny Sharples and a petition has already reached more than 25,000 signatures. Sadly for fans, it seems an unlikely option - the Bank of England has said that apart from the Queen, living Britons cannot feature on currency.

"Gary Andrews with his daughter Lily (11) and his son Ben (eight) How do you cope with the unexpected death of your partner of 19 years? That was the question facing Gary Andrews, 57, when his 41-year-old wife Joy died suddenly almost a year ago. Over the last 12 months he has discovered that, for him, the answer is doodling - a doodle a day to be precise. Gary, an animator and illustrator who has worked on Fireman Sam and for Disney, began his doodle diary, which he shareson social media,,externalon his 55th birthday in 2016. In a digital age he says he missed the scratch of pen on paper so ""made it a habit, last thing at night, to do a little sketch based on something that had happened that day"". However, it took on added significance when his wife, with whom he lived in Surrey along with their two children, died from sepsis. These were his first doodles following her death on 27 October: His week had started with his wife waving him off at Heathrow Airport on a Monday for a work trip to Canada. After a few days of feeling ill with flu-like symptoms, Joy was taken to hospital on the Thursday with a suspected kidney infection but her condition deteriorated rapidly. On the Friday at 03:15 she died from multiple organ failure caused by sepsis. Gary, in the departure lounge in Vancouver waiting for an emergency flight home, was told when he landed back in the UK. He had lost the woman he had been married to for 13 years, the person he describes as his best friend, and the mother of his two children - Lily, then 10, and Ben, then seven. Gary and Joy had met at an amateur theatre company The doodles were something they used to share together. ""When Joy died it became a form of therapy for me,"" he says. ""I thought I've got to keep it going because we used to look at it every night, so after she died I wasn't going to stop because it's who I am and it helps me think about what happened that day."" At the time he wrote: ""Was struggling a bit today, feeling pretty emotional. Then Lily comes out with this at bedtime. Kids are great levellers!"" They often feature Joy's presence and he says he finds it comforting, rather than difficult, to draw her. ""I close my eyes and I see her,"" he says. ""She's very present in our lives all the time, in our conversations, so drawing her just feels really natural. ""I've drawn her for the last 20 years."" One drawing which holds a particularly strong memory for him is the one he did on the day of the ceremony they held to celebrate her life. He wrote: ""Hard to draw through my tears tonight - but what an amazing send-off for my beautiful girl."" ""That's the only one I've ever done where I've had to draw it through tears,"" he says. ""I think I cried the whole time I was drawing it, but it needed to be done."" As he shared his doodles on social media, his family and friends were able to keep track of how he was coping following Joy's death. ""They liked it because it showed them where I was, my state of mind,"" he says. It was another way of communication. A phone call would often follow if he posted a couple in a row which made them worry. He says without doodling, he wouldn't have had an outlet for his thoughts. ""The great thing about the doodle is once it's down on the paper, the thought is out. ""You've got it out and can let it go. If it's a sad, negative thought - I get it down, I get it out. It kind of releases it, and then you can move on."" The doodles, which he draws in notebooks kept in chronological order on a shelf, have also been therapeutic for his children who he says ""love seeing them"". ""Lily will pick them off the shelf and go through the old ones. It's lovely that they can look back at it and use it as a memory. ""They laugh at the funny things they've done and they see the pictures of mum."" He sees it as important to document the funny moments in life as it is the poignant occasions. ""It might just be a day where my son says something stupid - and that will go in the doodle,"" he says. ""It's important to be able to laugh through grief. ""Life does go on, it has to. It has to be as silly and funny as it once was."" Gary wrote: ""Well they just blow me away with how open they are about the changes in our life. So proud."" Gary has more than 30,000 followers on Twitter and says he has experienced a ""universally lovely"" reaction to his doodles, which shows how they have struck a chord. ""People who are in a similar boat are seeing me write stuff, draw stuff, that relates to something happening in their life which maybe they haven't been able to articulate,"" he says. ""Or they see something that's been happening to them and realise they're not alone in feeling that."" Gary wrote: ""Nearly five months gone. Didn't think I had any more heart left to break but it turns out I was wrong. So beautiful and talented. #Sepsis sucks"" ""I had the best relationship,"" he says. ""We had 19 fantastic years. I was the luckiest guy. The universe decided I wasn't going to get that any longer but some good has to come out of it."" So as the anniversary of his wife's death approaches, will Gary be able to keep producing a doodle a day? ""The interaction with people has been lovely,"" he says. ""It's nice to know that there is a community out there, some of whom are taking comfort in it. ""I can't see why I would want to stop. I love doing it. I love putting my day on a piece of paper."" Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive. As the condition develops, symptoms may worsen and some more distinctive warning signs or ""red flags"" can emerge. These vary from patient to patient, but after discussions with sepsis survivors the UK Sepsis Trust has compiled a list of the six most common signs. They include: Slurred speech or confusion Extreme shivering or muscle pain Passing no urine (in a day) Severe breathlessness ""I feel like I might die"" Skin mottled or discoloured More fromNHS Choices,external .

"A salad nearly killed my brother. It was the mid-1990s. The incident involved a self-service counter and one bowl that contained hidden nuts. Adam was 10 years old. I was older, but still at school. I remember the nurse coming into my classroom to say he had been taken to hospital and I should make my own way home. My dad phoned me when I got there, trying to reassure me that everyone would be home soon. But knowing he must have raced back early from work, I felt uneasy. What I didn't know was that Adam was in a critical condition in an A&E bed. My parents had always avoided giving him nuts, because I had a severe allergy and we suspected he might too. This accidental consumption was the first proof. His body had gone into anaphylactic shock - a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to an allergen. New peanut allergy blood test developed Should we ban nuts in public places? Luckily, due to fast treatment, he pulled through. Afterwards, he got his first Epipen - a self-administering adrenalin injection - to give him a better first line of defence. My mum also complained to the supermarket and they changed their salad-bar policy, labelling the contents of each bowl and tethering the cartons to reduce risks of cross-contamination. Over the years, we have both got used to having the occasional ""run in"" with a nut. You do all that you can to be careful. You check the menu; you quiz the waiters; you scan the small print in the supermarket; you ask questions when anyone offers you a biscuit. You essentially do a risk assessment every time you eat, and mostly without realising you're doing it. Yet sometimes you slip up, or the restaurant does. Maybe a waiter forgets to pass your message on. Or perhaps you take a carefree bite into a Mexican taco because who puts peanuts in tacos? (Answer: an experimental London chef.) Adam at the age when he had his first anaphylactic shock Cases of nut allergy among children increased significantly during the 1990s, according to the UK-based support group the Anaphylaxis Campaign. Researchers are trying to work out why this is happening, and what can be done, including experimenting with weaning and desensitisation trials. Allergy admissions increase by 33% in five years In the meantime, those of us who belong to this unfortunate club have been adapting to survive. And to avoid overhyping, it is worth pointing out that deaths are still rare. US researchers have said people are more likely to die in an accident or be murdered. Which is reassuring, I suppose. The mother's take Lucy Patterson, who works for a charity near Cardiff, has a four-year-old son who has a whole host of severe allergies. The first sign of Jack's problem came when he was five months old and cow's milk in his porridge sent him into anaphylactic shock. Tests afterwards showed he was allergic to milk, eggs and nuts. ""When we buy food, we double and triple check the labels. Even if we bought the product before,"" she says. Jack also carries two Epipens at all times. As a family, they have decided not to eat out or travel abroad while he is young, but she hopes he will be able to do both in the future. ""I don't want to bring Jack up in fear. My job is to educate and protect him as much as I can, and that's easy when he's four. ""He is likely to eat out when he's older, so my job then is to ensure he asks the right questions, always carries his Epipens and that the friends he is with know the situation fully."" Jack wears a badge to alert others to his severe allergies When I read the recent news thatNatasha Ednan-Laperouse died after eating a Pret baguette, I knew the panic she must have gone through. That moment when you first reach for an antihistamine tablet, or an Epipen, and are unsure if your body can bring the situation back under control. I have had chefs and waiters refuse to believe me when I say I am having an allergic reaction. ""There were no nuts in that dish,"" they insist flatly. But it is not debatable as far as I am concerned. When there are nuts in a dish - particularly peanuts - I know as soon as the fork touches my tongue. Within seconds, my whole mouth and throat are overwhelmed by an intensely unpleasant sensation that is hard to describe. It is not a taste, more like an anti-taste, which sucks all other flavours out of my mouth, leaving a dry burn. There are plenty of hazards in a US cereal aisle Not all reactions are the same, though. Aside from the more serious effects of anaphylaxis, some people wheeze, others get stomach cramps. According to the British Medical Journal, one of the symptoms is a ""sense of impending doom"", which I find darkly hilarious but also true. The varying degrees of severity mean that some people are more willing to take risks than others. I remember a waiter at a hotel-restaurant once refusing to accept there were any nuts in what he had just served me. Fearing my throat might start to close, I wasn't in a position to continue arguing, but I knew there was no doubt. Once I had recovered, the waiter and the chef came to my room to apologise; they admitted there were peanuts in an appetiser, there had been a miscommunication. The hotel owners also visited me the next day, saying this had never happened before and they were going to do all they could to ensure it didn't happen again, starting by briefing all staff. Obviously I would have preferred not to have been the guinea pig, but this felt like progress. I had been listened to and taken seriously - eventually. The chef's take Amanda Freitag is a judge on Food Network's Chopped US chef and television host Amanda Freitag has a serious hazelnut allergy and ran a hazelnut-free kitchen when she was at the helm of New York City's Empire Diner. ""As soon as I started to talk about my allergy, some of my other colleagues revealed they have food allergies as well,"" she says. ""It's not something a chef always wants to discuss because we don't want to be limited in what we eat or cook. But I find it a welcome challenge to make a dish without the allergen. I like working to make the dish just as good or better."" Her advice to other chefs would be to take all allergies and food sensitivities very seriously. ""Do consistent menu training with all your staff - kitchen and front of the house - so that they are aware of all the ingredients in every dish and, if they are uncertain, to always come to the kitchen and ask to confirm,"" she says. ""Having menu descriptions written and constantly updated for the staff to reference is essential."" Pret A Manger - a major UK sandwich chain - has been under scrutiny for its approach to labelling after two deaths linked to its products, first Natasha and also ina dairy-allergy case. In 2015, I accidentally ate nuts in a Pret sandwich and I emailed them to ask if they would consider labels on the products. They told me this would be ""impossible"" and they only sought to ""provide a description of the flavours one may expect in a sandwich"". Natasha died the following year. After an inquest,they have now agreed to bring in labels. On the other end of the scale, I remember one major supermarket going through a phase of labelling everything with ""May contain nuts"" - even ham and orange squash. That was not particularly helpful. However, other companies have been praised for their approach. In the UK, many nut-allergy sufferers are fond of Welsh chocolate company Kinnerton, which prides itself on going to ""extraordinary lengths"" to make their produce safe. They even created two factories - one for nut produce, one for nut-free produce. If you want to set foot in the latter, you have to sign a document saying you have not eaten nuts that day or brought any with you. Airlines - which traditionally serve peanuts as on-board snacks - have also been under pressure to adapt to the times. It was in mid-air that my brother had his second-most serious anaphylactic shock. He now picks his flights based on their nut policy. British Airways still serves some nuts, so they are on the ""no"" list. Whereas EasyJet will agree to stop serving all nuts if you let them know, and this reassures him. In August, US company Southwest Airlines stopped serving peanuts on all its flights, but signalled the move with a particularly melodramatic goodbye. ""Peanuts forever will be part of Southwest's history and DNA,"" it wrote in a press release. ATV producer brain damaged by allergy Allergy death takeaway 'a disaster' ""The allergy community is very bruised by recent reports of fatal food-induced reactions,"" says Professor George Du Toit, a specialist in paediatric allergy at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' Trust. ""It is extremely distressing when you see legal cases [such asthe Pret A Manger case] playing out in the media. The reports typically arise long after the event, with delayed and mixed messages associated. This is all very frightening for allergic patients and their families,"" he says. He saida shortage of Epipenshad compounded the fears. ""Hopefully these tragic reports will lead to an increased understanding of food allergies and improved government support for increased provision of services to diagnose and support patients. The legislation around food allergen labelling is also in need of urgent review."" In The Times,writer Dominic Lawson responded to the Pret scandal,externalby saying people with severe allergies should never eat outside their house. Yet seeing as we are more likely to die in a car accident, should we stay in the house because of that, too? When driving, we all take reasonable precautions, like wearing a seatbelt and observing traffic lights; we also put a certain amount of confidence in other drivers and the company that made our cars. That's what I do when I eat out. Having a serious allergy is mostly just annoying. Believe me, I'd really rather not ask the questions or cause a fuss. I can appreciate it can be annoying for chefs and companies too. But it looks like we are all stuck with the problem, at least for now, and more co-operation and understanding could save lives.
