"Crooks' first-half score helped Leigh Centurions earn a third consecutive home win Betfred Super League Leigh Centurions: (12) 22 Tries:Hock 2, Crooks, HigsonGoals:Reynolds 3 Warrington Wolves (2) 8 Tries:LinehamGoals:Gidley, Livett Warrington Wolves' losing start to the season stretched to five straight Super League defeats as Leigh Centurions earned a deserved win in an electric atmosphere at the Leigh Sports Village. Tries from Gareth Hock and Ben Crooks gave Leigh a 12-2 half-time lead. Adam Higson and Hock extended the hosts' advantage after the break before Tom Lineham crossed to give Wolves hope of a comeback that never looked likely. Ben Reynolds missed three conversions but his late kick capped a big win. Warrington managed the first win by an English club over Australian opponents since 2012 when they beat Brisbane Broncos in the World Club Series in February - after a 2016 season in which they enjoyed a +250 points difference. This season they remain rooted to the bottom of Super League without a point. By contrast, newly promoted Leigh have already earned more points this term than in any previous Super League campaign in their history. Hock showed his strength to cross early on and Reynolds added the conversion before Crooks raced over to make it 10-0, Reynolds striking the post with his kick. The teams traded two-pointers before the break to maintain Leigh's 10-point lead. Both sides were temporarily reduced to 12 men in the second half as first Leigh's Glenn Stewart saw yellow for a high tackle on Kevin Brown, and then Wolves' Lineham was binned for lashing out at Ryan Hampshire. Handling errors let Warrington down and enabled Leigh to withstand heavy pressure when they were a man down before sealing victory with further unconverted tries from Higson and Hock, to move up to fourth in Super League. Leigh Centurions coach Neil Jukes: ""It was a real tough opening six games and to get 50 percent of them as wins is a real credit to the boys. We're finding our feet, we're getting battle-hardened. ""It's a cauldron here. We're starting games well but we're also finishing them strong so we're getting some consistency. ""Our defence was outstanding. Warrington are a class side and we did a real good job to put them under pressure, ""It never looked in doubt. I was disappointed with the try we conceded at the end but I can't complain too much."" Warrington Wolves coach Tony Smith: ""They out-enthused us. Both teams made a reasonable amount of errors in the first half and we gave away too many penalties. ""There was an amount of self-inflicted pain again. My players are trying hard but just coming up with wrong options and it's hurting us. ""Once we start making better decisions, we will come out the other side and get on a roll. ""We will re-group. We'll get in tomorrow into some hard work and fix it up. We'll have Stef Ratchford back next week but we've got to get some the people who are already out there back in their best form.""

"Headlines questioning Prince William's work ethic have dominated the tabloids after he was pictured on a ski holiday while other senior royals attended a service with Commonwealth leaders. ""Throne Idle"" and ""Ice work if you can get it"" were among the newspaper puns to greet the future king as he returned to the UK, having missed theCommonwealth Dayevents. When he's not dad-dancing in Verbier or spending time with his young family, the Duke of Cambridge splits his time between royal duties, a part-time job as a pilot and his charitable work. So far this year, the 34-year-old has attended royal engagements on 12 days, including a trip to south Wales, a gala dinner and an investiture at Buckingham Palace. The record of these attendances is detailed in theCourt Circular,external, which was last updated on 10 March and does not specify the hours of each event. Nor does it take into account behind-the-scenes activity or preparation for royal events. Since 2015, the prince has worked as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service. There, he works 9.5 hour shifts, clocking up an average of 20 hours per week - the salary for which is donated to charity. Based on these hours and the royal engagements, Prince William will have worked the equivalent of 34 of the possible 53 working days in 2017 so far. Earlier this year he announced he would beleaving his ambulance jobin the summer to take on more royal duties. By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a service of commemoration earlier this month This is not unfamiliar terrain for Prince William or indeed for his family. To be found wanting in the eyes of the tabloids is an occupational hazard that has dogged them for decades. When the prince decided to ski with his mates rather than leave early and attend a church service that mattered to his grandmother, he could have predicted that he would be judged to have made an error of judgement. It was an error that he can regret at leisure. But what he couldn't necessarily have predicted was that he would have remained headline news for so long. The future king is wary of the media.  The newspapers are increasingly concerned at his attempts to bypass them and use social media instead. The next test will come in the autumn when he becomes a full-time senior royal. If by then there isn't a noticeable increase in his royal workload, there's a risk the tabloids will once again sit in judgement and once again find Prince William wanting. Read more from Peter Hunt In 2016, Prince William clocked up 80 days of royal engagements - well behind the busiest member of the royal family, Princess Anne, with 179 days of engagements. Prince Charles, 68, came second with 139 and the Queen, 90, matched her grandson with 80 days. Prince William's job: What's it like being an air ambulance pilot? Prince William: 'We must do more on illegal ivory trade' Despite denouncing the work-shy claims as ""absolute rubbish"" and ""grossly unfair"", royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said the headlines were ""irresistible"" for the tabloid press. ""It's an unfair perception that the photographs reinforce,"" he said. Prince William has said criticism of being work-shy wasnot something he ignored, but not something he ""took completely to heart"" either. Prince William works about 80 hours a month as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance Prince William is patron or president to 23 organisations, including the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Not all the work he does to fulfil these roles is classed as a royal engagement. Centrepoint - the youth homelessness charity of which the Prince has been a patron since 2005 - said the royal visits hostels publicly and privately, volunteering alongside staff and regularly meeting with the Centrepoint parliament. Chief executive Seyi Obakin, said: ""Within the last three months, he has publicly and actively supported our plans to create a national helpline for homeless young people. ""Last month, he launched with us the Centrepoint helpline."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry race during the Team Heads Together London Marathon Training Day in February Prince William has also campaigned vigorously against animal poaching. At an international conference in November hecalled on the UK government to pass a total banon the domestic ivory trade. This week, the Cambridges are visiting Paris and in July, the royal couple are due to makean official visit to Germany and Poland, at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

"Theresa May has declared ""now is not the time"" for Nicola Sturgeon to call for an independence referendum To govern is to choose. The prime minister has now chosen to exercise her power over the constitution, reserved to Westminster under the Scotland Act 1998. This is about competing power, competing mandates, competing interpretations of the verdicts delivered during the European referendum last year. Theresa May accords primacy to the Brexit negotiations. She says she doesnot want even to contemplate the prospectof indyref2 during that period. That means she will not countenance a transfer of powers under Section 30 of the Scotland Act, again at this stage. Nicola Sturgeon accords primacy to the impact upon Scotland of the Brexit process. She says it is undemocratic for the PM to refuse to give Scotland a meaningful choice - that word again - within a suitable timescale, proximate to the Brexit plans. It is sinking the ship and puncturing Scotland's lifeboat. But this is also about political confidence. Political calculation. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, plainly calculates that she will have Scottish public opinion on her side. Or, more precisely, a sufficient quotient of public opinion. The Tories in Scotland have been through a period where they were the party which dared not speak its name, the toxic party. They now reckon those days are behind them. And why? The Union, post-2014. Their calculation - and it is an arithmetical sum - is that they can corral behind them the supporters of Union in Scotland. That, just as in the past, in the 1950s for example, they can draw backing from a relatively wide range of Scottish society, predicated upon concrete support for the Union - and fixed opposition to the SNP. It worked, to a substantial degree, in the last Holyrood elections when they became the largest opposition party. Their calculation is that it will work again, this time. Nicola Sturgeon is likely to press ahead with a Holyrood vote calling for a Section 30 order Will there be anger in some quarters at the Prime Minister's decision? There will indeed. Stand by for demonstrations to that effect at the SNP conference in Aberdeen. But the calculation by the Tories - and this is less quantifiable, but a calculation nevertheless - is that sufficient numbers of the populace in Scotland will be relieved that they do not have to decide on independence in the next 18 months to two years. The Tory leadership insists that they are not blocking a referendum entirely. That was Ruth Davidson's answer when she was reminded that she had told my estimable colleague Gordon Brewer in July last year that there should not be a constitutional block placed upon indyref2. The argument was that they are merely setting terms: evident fairness and discernible popular/political support for a further plebiscite. However, these are not absolute, they are open to interpretation. It would seem to be that the verdict on these factors would also lie with the Prime Minister. Such is the nature of reserved power. But, again, the Tory triumvirate - PM, secretary of state, Scottish leader - stress that a referendum might be feasible once Brexit is signed, sealed and settled. David Mundell seemed particularly keen to stress that point. However, if they won't contemplate Section 30 meantime, then the time needed for legislation, consultation and official preparation would suggest that - by that calendar - any referendum would be deferred until 2020 or possibly later. Possibly after the next Holyrood elections. Options for the FM? She could sanction an unofficial referendum, without statutory backing. Don't see that happening. It would be a gesture - and Nicola Sturgeon, as the head of a government, is generally averse to gestures. Unless they advance her cause. She could protest and seek discussions. Some senior Nationalists believe this to be a negotiation ploy by the PM, the prelude to talks. Will the first minister proceed with the vote next week at Holyrood, demanding a Section 30 transfer in which the Greens are expected to join with the SNP to create a majority? I firmly expect her to do so, to add to the challenge to the PM. Beyond that, expect the First Minister to cajole, to urge - but also to campaign. To deploy this deferral of an independence referendum as an argument forâ¦an independence referendum. She will seek public support, arguing that Scotland's interests have been ignored. Just as Ruth Davidson will seek public support, arguing that she is protecting those interests. Final thought. One senior Nationalist suggested to me that delay might, ultimately, be in the SNP's interests: that people were already disquieted by Brexit and would prefer a pause. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, to quote the old song.

"The NHS in England is under financial pressure. There is an intensifying debate about whether more money is needed and if so how much. Among the options being suggested is a dedicated tax for the health service - transparent, easily understandable and less prone to political interference, or so the theory goes. So how realistic might it be? The ring-fencing of tax for a specific purpose is known as hypothecation.  One example, though not technically a tax, is the television licence fee, which is a levy specifically to fund the BBC. The idea of a hypothecated tax for health has been knocked back and forth between economists for many years. Dr Henry Marsh: 'We need a new tax to save the NHS' Public 'back tax rises for healthcare' 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble A panel of health experts has now backed hypothecation, or at least included it in a shortlist of policies for raising extra revenue. The panel includes: former NHS England head Sir David Nicholson former Royal College of GPs head Clare Gerada former Royal College of Nursing head Peter Carter Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy Commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, they have produced an interim set of proposals. Their final report is due out in the next few months. The expert panel argues that more money is needed than currently planned and this should come from taxation. Income tax and National Insurance (NI) are options, says the panel, but a dedicated health and care tax would offer ""clear benefits"". It would ""improve understanding of what health and care cost, and enhance transparency about how our taxes our used"". National Insurance, so the thinking goes, could be the basis for a new health and care tax. In other words, the current proceeds of NI would all be targeted at the NHS. It just so happens that the yield to the government from NI, about Â£126bn annually, is not far off the total spend on the NHS across the UK. This would reflect the original purpose of NI after World War Two, which was to allow workers to insure themselves against sickness or other loss of earnings. The lines have since become blurred, with NI now in effect an extension of income tax. The panel's call for more money will hit taxpayers' wallets, whether its through income tax or a new health and social care levy. The experts believe an extra Â£20bn is needed for the NHS in 2020 over and above current plans, with a few billion more needed for social care. That would represent a big hit on taxpayers, individual or corporate. But the supporters of a dedicated health and social care tax believe it would give voters reassurance that their money was going to the right place. So what's the catch? To start with, the Treasury has always hated the idea of hypothecation. The chancellor's flexibility over tax and public spending decisions is reduced if certain taxes are earmarked in advance for specific purposes. Dr Clare Gerada supports a hypothecated tax And what if during a recession the yield from a health and care tax is reduced? In theory, spending on the NHS would have to fall. If extra top-ups from different taxes are brought in, then the system becomes confused and drifts back to what it is now. Scotland, of course, has its own tax-raising powers, and all the devolved nations make their own decisions about health spending. Making hypothecation work just in England if it involves UK-wide tax revenue could be problematic. Some argue that extra money for the NHS is not the issue anyway. A recent report from the regulator NHS Improvement said that health trusts in England could save Â£400m a year simply by running their IT and payroll systems more effectively. There is a case for more efficiency in the NHS and better use of resources in the face of rising patient demand. The debate will continue. Earmarking tax for health and social care will be part of it. Proponents will need to show that patient care will be improved and convince taxpayers that will be the case.

"More than 10 million people voted in Wednesday's election for the Dutch parliament A breeze rustles the proud daffodils outside parliament amid the spring sunshine. The glorious weather was one reason for the high 80% turnout. Another was that Dutch voters realised the importance of this election. The result means everything can stay the same, but the reality is far more fragmented and the mainstream parties would be foolish to ignore it. The diplomatic stand-off with Turkey presented centre-right leader Mark Rutte with an electoral dream andprovided a platformto project his prime ministerial calm across the country. Rutte first became prime minister in 2010 and is now set for a third term His victory was decisive and yet he lost a quarter of his seats in parliament. The leader of the EU's sixth largest economy defeated Geert Wilders' Freedom party with ""Wilders-lite"" policies to woo back those flirting with the idea of voting for the populists. The result appears to contradict suggestions that the EU is falling apart, with significant successes for the pro-EU Green-Left and D66. Eyes will turn next to voters in France and Germany to see if that is true. Jesse Klaver's message struck a chord with many voters A photo of the BBC interviewing the earnest young leader of the Green-Left party was widely shared on social media. European press relieved at Dutch vote Jesse Klaver's optimistic grassroots campaign has done what Mr Wilders had wanted - inspired a movement beyond Dutch borders. The man nicknamed ""Jessiah"" preaches a different brand of populism: ""We are the opposite of Wilders, he is hate and we are love,"" he told me while being swamped by a sea of selfie-snapping schoolgirls. Labour, traditionally the biggest party on the left, had been the junior party in Mr Rutte's budget-cutting coalition and became the biggest loser on the night. Supporters said they had sold out on their principles and they paid the ultimate price at the polls. Jesse Klaver is aware of the risks involved in joining a coalition dominated by right-of-centre parties. Geert Wilders' party is now the Netherlands' second largest but polls suggested he would do better Geert Wilders didn't perform as well as the polls predicted. But he came second and is claiming a win. Numerous people from Alfred, trundling a suitcase over the cobbles outside parliament, to the tipsy, bright-eyed students twirling inside Amsterdam's ""Milky Way"" music venue, referred a jibe by Mark Rutte during a head-to-head debate with his populist rival on Monday. ""There is a difference between tweeting from your sofa and running a country,"" he said. The effect was to characterise his main rival as a Twitter troll. Yet more than a million voters chose Mr Wilders' anti-Islam, anti-EU party, which wants to implement policies that would undermine the Dutch constitution. Mr Rutte must look at the state of the country and wonder what has made people so disillusioned, or so inspired, that they are prepared to place their faith in a man who runs a Twitter account rather than a traditional political party. In a campaign dominated by concepts of culture, identity and integration, Geert Wilders succeeded in shaping the debate. The result suggests a seed has been planned on both sides of the political spectrum. The next challenge for Mr Rutte is to form a coalition. The centre-right VVD party won the most seats in Wednesday's election, but eight fewer than in 2012 European press relieved at Dutch vote Polling stations Dutch-style Dutch election explained in tulips.

"Office space: Our correspondent assesses conditions at the Colosseum ""Position Description: Director of Italian Archaeological Site: Colosseum (Rome)"" It is a pretty tempting job. The successful applicant will be in charge of preserving the site of one of the world's most iconic monuments. That person may as well be me. The job advert asks for at least five years' experience managing archaeological sites. Well, I have five years experience visiting sites. If outsiders with little experience can be elected to lead countries, why can't they also be chosen to run ancient monuments? The first thing to do is come up with a pitch. One potential idea is to rebuild the entire Colosseum. The pyramids in Egypt have not fallen down. So why should Rome have to live with half a Colosseum? My first campaign stop is with tourists visiting the site. ""Don't touch anything,"" warn Jocelyn and Tamaya, students from North Carolina. ""Don't you want to see what it would have looked like?"" I ask. ""There are digital models online which show what it would have been like. So just keep this,"" they instruct. ""Do you not think it's iconic to leave it as it is?"" asks Stan from Manchester. ""It's like when we went to Egypt, they were redoing the Sphinx. In some ways it spoils the effect of what it should be."" So rebuilding turns out to be a bad idea. I change my job pitch from rebuilding to listening. What needs fixing at the Colosseum? ""The process of entering through security can be slow and occasionally discourteous,"" says tour guide Agnes Crawford. ""The turnstiles very often don't work properly. The people who are manning the turnstiles have the patience of Job because it's a thankless task with a lot of slightly cross people."" Opera singer Andrea Bocelli cheered everyone up when he sang at the Colosseum. The turnstiles were probably working that day. Andrea Bocelli performed at the Colosseum in 2009 in aid of the earthquake-ravaged city of L'Aquila Another idea has caused something of a controversy: renting the site to private firms. ""When one considers that the Colosseum saw 450 years of people being killed, I think the occasional corporate dinner seems fairly small beer in comparison,"" says Agnes Crawford. Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini will have the final say over the Colosseum's new director. Nerve-wrackingly, my final appointment is with him. ""We're looking for people with a strong background - archaeologists, art historians, architects, who also have experience managing a cultural site or a museum,"" he tells me. ""Naturally, if you want to manage the Colosseum and the Imperial Forum, which receive six million visitors a year, you need the scientific knowledge but also the management experience. ""I think in the art world nationalities don't really count. The director of the National Gallery is an Italian, who arrived there from El Prado in Madrid. The director of the British Museum is German. So it's normal that what counts are the CVs, not the nationalities."" I seize my chance. ""Minister, you've opened this up to outsiders, a lot of people will put in applications coming in with new ideas, I will put an application as well. Are you open to hearing from outsiders?"" There is a slight pause before he answers. ""Well, we have job requirements to be admitted for the selection. When we recently chose the directors of the 20 top museums in Italy we received 400 applications. The selection did more than 100 job interviews. It will be similar this time. So you can definitely apply, but to win you need to fulfil the requirements."" It was an elegant way of saying ""don't give up the day job"".

"A leading African writer has transfixed the internet with her comments on gender - but fellow Nigerians say they feel hurt.

""What happened to being inclusive and tolerant of all women, no matter their life histories?"" ""I get a lot of online messages from Nigerian trans girls who are there now and they find it so difficult. A nightmare,"" Sahhara told BBC Trending, ""there's no male privilege for trans women in Africa."" Growing up in rural northern Nigeria, where homosexual activity can be punishable by death (although no executions by law for homosexual activity have been verified), Sahhara says that it was ""obvious to all"" that she was ""a girl in a boy's body"". Nigeria is one 34 African countries that outlaws same-sex relationships, and since the Nigerian government tightened its anti-gay laws in 2014, punishments have become much harsher. ""My uncles beat me up for the way I behaved,"" Sahhara says. ""It's the way it's done in Africa."" This video can not be played Transgender model Miss Sahhara: 'I left Nigeria to save my life' Sahhara moved to the UK 13 years ago, but is in close online contact with the LGBT community in Africa. She says that social media is a vital lifeline for the transgender community there, who often live in secret. Sahhara lives openly as an LGBT activist in the UK, and many of these women get in touch with her through her Facebook page. ""I've had transgender women from South Africa get in touch with me and ask what hormones I recommend,"" Sahhara says, ""or women from Nigeria saying 'listen sister, a friend of mine has been locked up, can you raise awareness online?'."" ""They communicate with me on my Facebook page, or secretly through private digital groups I refer them to"". Mike Daemon (not his real name) who runs an LGBT advocacy website calledNo Strings Nigeria,externaltold BBC Trending: ""Africa's transgender women rely on a secret digital life involving Whatsapp groups and closed Facebook groups."" ""People are added through referrals and recommendations when they are trusted."" However he reflected the nuanced response Chimanda Ngozi Adiche's comments.  Many of those commenting acknowledged Adicihie's feminist contribution and that the issue is complex.  Daemon said Adichie was being   ""realistic"" and that trans women and biologically born women have ""different journeys."" Miss Sahhara, for her part, is hesitant when BBC Trending asked her if she identifies as a feminist. ""I believe in equal rights and pay for women,"" she says but, ""when I start hearing the ladies from the TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist), it discourages me from wanting to be part of feminism. We are fighting for equality and yet you say other women are not equal because you don't feel comfortable with who they are or who they used to be."" Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche, a vocal advocate of LGBT rights in Africa, declined an interview with BBC Trending and referred us to her statement on Facebook. ""I think the impulse to say that trans women are just like women born female comes from a need to make trans issues mainstream,"" she says there. ""Because by making them mainstream, we might reduce the many oppressions they experience. But it feels disingenuous to me. The intent is a good one but the strategy feels untrue. Diversity does not have to mean division.""

"The Crown Prosecution Service has announced that no Conservative politicians or officials are to be prosecuted for allegedly breaking election expenses rules in 2015. Fourteen files on alleged expenses violations were handed to the CPS by local police forces to decide if criminal prosecutions could be mounted. The CPS could find no evidence that spending rules had been deliberately broken by Tory agents or candidates when filling in their returns. ""Although there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest,"" said Nick Vamos, head of special crime at the CPS, in a statement. A fifteenth file, on the contest in South Thanet, where the Tories saw off a challenge from then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only recently handed to the CPS by Kent Police. The CPS said it ""remains under consideration"". Nick Vamos said: ""No inference as to whether any criminal charge may or may not be authorised in relation to this file should be drawn from this fact and we will announce our decision as soon as possible once we have considered the evidence in this matter."" It will be a big relief to the Conservative Party. If the CPS had decided to press ahead with prosecutions it would have thrown the party's campaign into chaos. All of the contests under investigation were in marginal seats. The party would have faced a last-minute scramble to get new candidates in place before the deadline. Party chairman Patrick McLoughlin said: ""These were politically motivated and unfounded complaints that have wasted police time. We are glad that this matter is finally resolved. ""A number of false and malicious claims continue to be spread on the internet. People should be aware that making false claims about a candidate's personal character and conduct is an electoral offence, as well as being defamatory. ""Notwithstanding these false claims, Conservatives want to strengthen election rules to safeguard electoral integrity - in light of the real and proven cases of electoral fraud exposed in Tower Hamlets in 2015."" The Conservative candidate for Lincoln, Karl McCartney, who was interviewed as part of the investigation, said heads should roll at the Electoral Commission watchdog. ""This whole saga amounts to no more than a politically-motivated witch-hunt,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""surprised"" by the CPS decision and wanted to ""look at the details"" of it. He said he accepted that the CPS was an independent body and ""they have to make the judgement"" but it was crucial election law was enforced to ensure that ""money can't buy power"". The Conservative Party failed to accurately report how much it spent on its 2015 general election campaign and on three by-elections. In March they were fined a record Â£70,000 by the Electoral Commission, which criticised the party for resisting its investigationin a report,external, The investigation wasprompted by a Channel 4 News investigation,external, The Electoral Commission believed criminal offences may have taken place under the Representation of the People Act and asked the CPS to look into it. The party was essentially accused of using its national party muscle to get local candidates elected - something that's not allowed under the rules. Parties have to stick to strict spending limits to try to ensure a level playing field. The CPS looked at whether candidates and election agents working in constituencies that were visited by the Conservative Party's party's ""battle bus"" had committed an offence by not declaring related expenditure on their local returns. It found local Tory agents had been told that costs relating to the ""battle bus"" were part of the party's national campaign. As a result, the CPS concluded, ""it would not be possible to prove any agent acted knowingly or dishonestly"". The Conservatives say the misreported spending figures were an ""administrative error"" and not evidence of a conspiracy. The Liberal Democratswere fined Â£20,000 in December for undeclared general election spending. Three months earlier, Labour was fined the same amount for not fully declaring its election spending, includingmore than Â£7,000 on the so-called Ed Stone,on which then leader Ed Miliband carved six election pledges. The Electoral Commission says it does not have sufficient powers to prevent overspending. It has warned that ""there is a risk that some political parties might come to view the payment of these fines as a cost of doing business"". Also, the Commission can only investigate national party spending and does not have the power to bring criminal prosecutions.

"On election day last year, American voters gave the Republicans a powerful gift - unified control of the presidency and Congress for the first time in a decade. But turning a governing majority into enacted policies is proving to be a challenge for a party that spent the past eight years throwing political bombs from the sidelines. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan took to the lectern for a press conference on Thursday morning facing a crisis. The healthcare reform legislation he has tried to shepherd through Congress is in serious peril. Conservative members of his chamber, like Dave Brat of Virginia, were savaging the legislation for not fully dismantling the existing Obamacare system. Moderates and even some middle-of-the-road Republicans, like Florida's Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, said they could not support it because cuts to the Medicaid programme for the poor were too severe. Mr Ryan has been forced to walk a political tightrope, balancing the competing and often conflicting interests in his caucus in an attempt to get the first step in a multi-part reform effort through the House. It is a feat that will require a combination of diplomatic finesse, political muscle, relentless focus and more than a bit of luck. This video can not be played Trump's wiretap saga explained in two minutes That's not what reporters wanted to talk about, however. Instead, the first question was about Donald Trump's allegation - and continued insistence - that his communications had been monitored by Barack Obama's White House during the 2016 presidential campaign. And therein lies the heart of the problem facing conservatives just a few months into the Trump presidency. At a time when a concerted political effort on the part of Republican leadership in Congress and the White House is essential to the success of a key part of their agenda, distractions and dissent rule the day. While Mr Ryan is undertaking his juggling act, the president seems intent on throwing baseballs at his head. Time and again the president has undermined Republican political priorities with off-message comments and tweets. Behaviour that helped throw opponents off-balance and demonstrate his unorthodoxy during the campaign are proving less helpful when conducted from the confines of the White House. Mr Trump's remarks about wiretapping and earlier allegations of widespread voter fraud, wholly unnecessary given his victory last November, have forced the White House to scramble with after-the-fact explanations and thrown unwelcome obligations on congressional Republicans to conduct investigations. On Wednesday, a visibly frustrated Devin Nunes, chair of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump ally, straight-up said Mr Trump was ""wrong"" about the surveillance. The Senate Intelligence Committee would later issue a statement that they found ""no indications of monitoring Trump Tower by any element of the United States government"". Mr Trump's own words, as well as statements made by his advisors since inauguration day, also helped torpedo the president's second effort at instituting a travel ban on some majority Muslim nations. House Intelligence committee chair Devin Nunes (foreground) and the committee's ranking Democrat, California's Adam Schiff, said there was no evidence of Trump's wiretapping claims ""The record before this court is unique,"" wrote the federal judge who suspended the travel order on Wednesday. ""It includes significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the executive order and its related predecessor."" Even without the travel ban and wiretapping controversies roiling Washington politics, Republicans were going to have a challenge transitioning from being the party of opposition, intent on thwarting the efforts of the Obama administration, to the party of action. While it was easy for the conservatives in Congress to pass straight-up Obamacare repeal legislation when they knew Mr Obama would veto it, crafting legislation that the party has to stand behind - and explain to voters in coming elections - is much trickier. During a Wednesday night televised town hall forum on healthcare there was a telling moment when Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price listened to a cancer patient lament that he would lose his medical coverage under the Republican plan. Mr Price's response was to criticise past Democratic promises on healthcare. The questioner wasn't buying it. Republicans have to come up with solutions now, not just identify problems. As any Democrat in office during the past eight years will explain, saying ""our plan is less bad than the existing system"" isn't a recipe for political success. Yes, it's still the first few months of the Trump presidency, and the drive to pass something, anything on healthcare after eight years of promises will be strong. Mr Trump could find new focus and use some of his much-advertised dealmaking acumen to pull competing factions within the Republican Party together. His party has the votes in Congress to get things done, and with a bit of positioning he could put significant pressure on Senate Democrats up for re-election next year in states he carried in 2016. Trump back in rally mode, this time with the seal of the president Then again, Mr Trump has shown few signs of easing back on his social media rants. He says he will hold large public rallies every few weeks, where his unscripted comments often set off new controversies. There also may be powers within the White House - such as senior advisor Steve Bannon - who would be happy if the Republican congressional agenda comes crashing down, bringing the remnants of the party's establishment with it. For Republican congressional leadership, healthcare reform is only the first piece of the legislative puzzle. The longer that takes, the less time will remain for comprehensive tax reform, which has its own sticky political issues. A massive budget fight, with the threat of a government shutdown, also looms on the horizon. Mr Trump's aggressive funding priorities are already coming under fire. Democrats are digging in to defend social programmes on the chopping block. Some Republicans object to billions of dollars for Mr Trump's border wall and sharp reductions in foreign aid and agricultural subsidies. If negotiations over healthcare reform go south, Republicans in Congress will be less inclined to give Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt in the coming days. Democrats will smell blood, and the subsequent political lifts will be all the more difficult. Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren have attacked the healthcare bill By next year members of Congress will be focused on the coming midterm elections and less inclined to take risks on big legislative actions with uncertain prospects. There's already evidence of a time bomb underneath the Republican Party. Polls show uneasy independents and near universal opposition to their agenda from Democrats, but for the time being their supporters held firm. If those numbers dip, however, and enthusiasm diminishes, it could spell ruin for congressional Republicans in 2018. Ever since Mr Obama swept to power with Democratic congressional majorities in 2008, Republicans have been promising their voters that real conservative change is just an election away. Yes, they won the House of Representatives in 2010, but they still needed the Senate. Yes, they won the Senate in 2014, but the presidency was in Democratic hands. Now they have Congress and the presidency, leaving few excuses. After two months of intra-party bickering and a president who can't keep his hands off his Twitter account, it may only be a matter of time before their base gets restless. Conservative humourist PJ O'Rourke once quipped that ""Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work, and then they get elected and prove it"". For the past few months that line has seemed less of a joke than a prophecy.

"Camilita Nuttall will never forget her worst business lunch experience Camilita Nuttall says it was the business lunch from hell. It was the first time that she and a new contact had met in person. Ms Nuttall, a UK motivational speaker, says the man gave no explanation for turning up half an hour late at a London restaurant, and then proceeded to talk purely about himself. To add insult to injury, she says he then told her that she wasn't qualified to run her own business. And all this while he ordered the most expensive main course, and told Ms Nuttall that she'd have to foot the entire bill. ""It was the worst,"" says Ms Nuttall, 42. First things first, a business lunch isn't going out for a bite to eat with your mates from the office - that's socialising with colleagues. It is instead a business meeting, usually in a restaurant, and typically with someone from another organisation, or at least someone who doesn't work in your team. And the conversation will include business matters - be it talk about a sale, agreement or understanding that benefits both parties. Lots of things can go wrong during a business lunch You might think that going for a business lunch is a simple thing, but it is in fact beset with a whole menu of potential perils and pratfalls. From the choice of venue, to what food you pick, whether you order alcohol, and how you share the bill, any number of things can go wrong. Talking politics and religion is almost always a complete no-no, but what if an innocent chat about current affairs quickly turns to President Trump, Brexit or Scottish independence? We asked some etiquette experts and business coaches to guide us through the minefield. The first issue for someone organising a business lunch is the choice of restaurant. ""You need to find somewhere with a careful balance of ambience,"" says Jenny Flintoft, a leadership consultant based in the north of England. It is perhaps best not to order food that is messy or difficult to eat ""I tend to favour a restaurant that is buzzy enough that conversations can be had without being overheard in a deathly quiet restaurant, but not one that has lots of background music, as the voice raising makes having a meaningful conversation very difficult."" Ms Flintoft also notes the importance of choosing the right dishes. ""I personally steer clear of corn on the cob, as it can easily get stuck in teeth,"" she says. ""[I would also avoid] spaghetti or foods with sloppy sauces, or anything that requires a lot of effort to eat, such as shellfish. ""During a business luncheon I want to concentrate on my fellow diner, not battling with the meal."" You also need to bear in mind the ethical or religious food rules that the other person may follow. For example, ordering the foie gras followed by the veal might not be a great idea, and booking a restaurant that specialises in suckling pig could cause offence. Picking a restaurant that specialises in pork or ham may not be a good idea When you have reserved a table in a hopefully appropriate restaurant, one of the biggest questions that lunchtime is - to drink, or not to drink? British etiquette expert Jo Bryant says that alcohol is best avoided because the social atmosphere of a restaurant ""can easily let us forget that the lunch is for business purposes"". She continues: ""Add in a glass or two and you might be at risk of relaxing too much, and saying or agreeing to do something you might regret. ""It is important to stay sharp and maintain your professional gloss."" Hitting the booze may not be particularly wise However, London-based business coach Phil Jones suggests a middle ground when it comes to the wine list. ""Allow the other person to take the lead,"" he says. ""Sometimes it is a loosening of the collar. ""It's a chance to get some deeper issues, to speak a bit freer."" Even without alcohol, conversations over a business lunch can all too easily go awry. Ms Flintoft says: ""Some people launch very quickly into diatribes about a particular hot [political] potato, and there's a lot of those around at the moment, which makes me question their judgement. ""But there needs to be a good mix of genuine conversation versus pitching."" It is usually best to avoid any political debate Ms Nuttall says there should be a number of ""no-fly"" discussions. ""There should be absolutely no talking about sex, politics, religion, bad talking other people or companies, or negatives about your own company or theirs."" Mr Jones says people should also guard against venting any personal problems they might be struggling with. ""One man's wife was having an affair, and I was the first person he'd confided in,"" he says. ""I was given the role of therapist by someone who was a complete stranger to me."" Wherever the lunch, and whatever the topic, William Hanson, a UK etiquette coach advises being mindful of the other person's time. ""The worst ones are where they drag on and your host thinks you don't have anywhere else to be,"" he says. When it comes to picking up the tab at the end of the meal Mr Hanson has a simple rule. ""Whoever extended the invitation, and has made the reservation, pays,"" he says. Should you always split the bill? To avoid any awkwardness or uncertainty when the bill arrives, Mr Hanson suggests that the inviter goes one stage further, and gives his or her credit card details to the restaurant ahead of the meal. ""It takes away the nasty money dilemma at the end,"" he says. Mr Hanson takes a more relaxed approach though if a lunch with a particular client or associate becomes a regular event. Under such circumstances he says that a ""turn-taking arrangement can often be struck"". Ms Nuttall adds that she often thinks that if one of the parties has travelled a long distance, they should be treated to lunch. But normally she suggests that the bill should generally be split equally.

"The latest hijacking off the Somali coast could mark the return of a lucrative business The hijacking of a merchant fuel tanker by pirates off the Somali coast this week has sent shockwaves through parts of the shipping industry. It is the first successful hijacking of a major commercial vessel in the Somali Basin since 2012 and is prompting debate over whether shipping companies have become complacent about the risk of maritime piracy. The MT Aris 13 was travelling from Djibouti to Mogadishu on 13 March when, instead of giving the Somali coast a wide berth as advised, it took a short cut between the tip of the Horn of Africa and the Yemeni island of Socotra. Somali pirates then ambushed the vessel just 11 miles (17km) from shore with two fast speedboats, known as skiffs, while aiming their weapons at the crew. The vessel and its crew of eight Sri Lankan seafarers have now been seized by the pirates and are being held pending either ransom negotiations or a rescue attempt by the regional Puntland authorities. This brings to 16 the number of seafarers currently being held by Somalia-based pirates, the remaining eight being Iranians. ""For a vessel passing that close to the coast of Somalia without armed guards shows a level of complacency,"" said a spokesman for Neptune Maritime Security, which is currently running armed protection teams on around 70 vessels this month as they pass through the area of the western Indian Ocean known as the High Risk Area (HRA). Employing armed teams, usually former servicemen, is seen by many shipping companies as prohibitively expensive. Shipping industry analysts say many vessels, especially those with a high freeboard (the vertical distance between the surface of the sea and the deck) have simply been speeding up to avoid capture. This is part of what is known as Best Management Practice, or BMP4. Although pirates have, in the past, been incredibly adept at scaling the sides of big ocean-going vessels while in motion, this becomes very hard to do at speeds of 15 knots or more, especially if the captain takes evasive action, creating an unpredictable bow wave that can sink the pirates' skiffs. A protection team scan the southern Gulf of Aden for pirates while passing through the High Risk Area Radar on board the protection team's vessel monitors suspect vessels The EU anti-piracy naval force off the coast of Mogadishu in 2013 In recent years the European Union and other nations, including China, have mounted naval patrols to deter Somali piracy and escort convoys along the coast of Yemen. But the area is so vast that their ships were rarely able to reach a vessel in distress in time. Once pirates were onboard it became a hostage situation which most naval vessels' rules of engagement prevented them from getting involved in. ""The navies' presence is good,"" says John Steed from the seafarers' welfare group Oceans Beyond Piracy, ""but the primary factor in deterring Somali piracy has been the presence of armed guards onboard, along with best practice like speeding up,"" he added. The ship that was captured on Monday had a low freeboard and was travelling so slowly that it was, he says ""almost a sitting duck"". So will this latest hijacking be a wake-up call that prompts more precautions being taken at sea or will it signal the start of a new wave of piracy? Worryingly, the factors that drove many Somali coastal fishermen to become pirates nearly a decade ago are still there. Somalia is currently in the grip of a famine and poverty is widespread; there are few employment options for young people. There is massive and growing local resentment at the poaching of fish stocks off the coast by Asian trawlers. According to Oceans Beyond Piracy, some foreign vessels have ""dubious"" licences issued by officials in Puntland, but the local people never get to see any benefit from them. Somali 'Pirates' demand ransom A broken business model? The high point in Somali piracy came in 2010, both in terms of vessels hijacked and the number of seafarers taken prisoner for ransom. Soon after that, shipping companies began placing armed guards onboard who would ""show weapons"" to circling pirates and if necessary fire warning shots to ward them off. This effectively broke the pirates' business model as, until then, they had been able to approach a ship, often at dawn after a night of chewing the narcotic qat leaf, open fire on the bridge to scare the captain into slowing down and stopping, and then they would board it using ladders. They would then hold the vessel, its crew and its cargo for ransoms of millions of dollars. After 2010 they were no longer able to do this with impunity. But now that news will have spread that many vessels are not carrying that armed protection there are concerns that the lucrative business of Somali maritime piracy may be set to return.

"This video can not be played Josh Edmondson: Former Team Sky rider speaks exclusively to BBC sports editor Dan Roan British cyclist Josh Edmondson has told the BBC he broke the sport's rules by secretly injecting himself with a cocktail of vitamins when riding for Team Sky. The 24-year-old, who was on the team's books in 2013 and 2014, also said he had severe depression after independently using the controversial painkiller Tramadol. Edmondson said the pressure of his selection for a major race in 2014 led to him breaching the UCI's 'no-needle' policy ""two or three times a week"" for about a month. Listen: a BBC Radio 5 live BeSpoke special looks at the issue Team Sky say legal vitamins and a needle were found in Edmondson's room, but they did not report the incident because he denied using them, and over concerns he ""could be pushed over the edge"". Edmondson says he confessed to Team Sky at the time but there was ""a cover-up"" by senior management. Team Sky are renowned for their robust, no-needle, no-Tramadol stance. In a wide-ranging and emotional interview, Edmondson told the BBC: He travelled to Italy from his training base in Nice to purchase a variety of legal vitamins and intravenous equipment. He risked giving himself a heart attack by self-administering the medication secretly at night. He independently took powerful opioid Tramadol during the 2013 Tour of Britain. Team Sky say this was given to him without their knowledge by the race doctor, rather than their own team doctor. He didn't leave his house for two months because of severe depression partly caused by using Tramadol. This video can not be played Former Team Sky head of medicine Dr Steve Peters defends the care given to rider Josh Edmondson ""In 2014 I was under a lot of pressure, not just from the team but from myself,"" said Edmondson. ""You want to renew your contract for one thing, and for me the bigger thing was not letting anyone down - this team had given me a chance by signing me and a bigger chance by letting me go to a Grand Tour [the Vuelta a Espana]. ""I think it was just before the Tour of Austria, I went to Italy to buy the vitamins that I was going to later inject. I brought them all back to Nice. I bought butterfly clips, the syringes, the carnitine [a supplement], folic acid, 'TAD' [a supplement], damiana compositum, and [vitamin] B12, and I'd just inject that two or three times a week maybe. Especially when I wanted to lose weight, I'd inject the carnitine more often because it was very effective."" The vitamins Edmondson bought are legal, but the UCI - the sport's governing body - brought in rules in 2011 banning cyclists from using needles. ""It dawned on me while I was doing it how extreme it was, putting the needle in and making sure there are no bubbles because if there is air in it, it can give you a heart attack and people can die from that,"" he said. ""It is a very daunting thing to be doing, especially as I was sat in a room in a foreign country alone at night. It's just a very surreal thing you do. It's not something you take lightly. You're doing it out of necessity really."" Edmondson admits he was tempted to dope, adding: ""But this was my way of closing the gap a little without doping. Some people think there is a grey area, and that's why there is a no-needle policy, but people across sport have been injecting vitamins for years and it is an alternative to doping. ""It's not the same - if you were doping, you are getting massive gains. This is just freshening what you do naturally."" Edmondson says he is prepared to now talk to the anti-doping authorities about his past. While Edmondson was racing at the Tour of Poland, his secret was exposed when a team-mate took photographs of the vitamins and equipment he had bought, and reported it to team management. ""I got back from that and noticed all the vitamins which had been hidden in my room were on top of this chest of drawers - and I realised I'd been caught out,"" said Edmondson. ""At that point I was panic-stricken. I'd never known anything like it. You just go weak and I had no idea what to do."" Edmondson said Team Sky's then head of medicine, Dr Steve Peters, informed him of the discovery of the evidence. ""He said 'there's been an incident' and I broke down. I was crying, I was in shock. And he said, 'somebody has sent us some photos of this intravenous equipment and the vitamins'."" Josh Edmondson in action for Team Sky Dr Peters confirmed to the BBC that a member of Team Sky who shared a house with Edmondson had found ""a needle and some vials"", and had taken a photograph of the evidence. But Team Sky say the incident was not reported, after Edmondson told Dr Peters via Skype that he had not used the equipment. ""He fell apart at the seams quite dramatically. A number of things I asked him during that interview really alarmed me,"" said Dr Peters. ""I was now in a position where I can say the welfare of the athlete was number one. Obviously, I'm working with the team and anti-doping is a secondary issue but a really important one, and we have to address it, so Josh explained that he had never used needles before. ""He was in a very stressful situation. He was aware that his role in the team was in jeopardy. We sent off the vials, there was only one that was open, the rest were sealed. They turned out to be vitamins which you can buy over the counter, so I asked him 'why on earth would you?' And he had not done any injection, he said he did not know how to use it. All he said was: 'I did not know what to do so I left it.' ""This didn't quite ring true to me. I felt this is very odd from what I've experienced in the past when I've been involved with anti-doping issues. So I said to the team: 'I want to stop here.' ""Wearing my hat as a doctor, for somebody to be culpable they cannot be ill and I suspect he was ill. If he's not able to give informed consent to what he is doing and say, 'I understand this', then in my world, as a psychiatrist, you are not culpable, because your illness is talking. ""The second point from me is, let's say we went ahead at that point because obviously I do not want to cover anything up - there is no way I'm going to do that. But what is the consequence of him suddenly being exposed if I'm right and he's not well? The reason I stopped it in its tracks is my concern has always got to be for the welfare of the individual."" Dr Peters said he then met Edmondson on 2 September 2014, when supervision and a behavioural programme was set up until the end of his contract. ""Once a week he reported to one of the team managers, and she would check on how it was going. She would report back to me, because I can't forcefully get people to speak to me. I don't know what happened to him after that because he did not want to engage with us."" Team Sky say they took legal advice at the time of the incident and say that, although Edmondson had been in breach of team rules by possessing the equipment, they were under no obligation to report the case to the authorities. Asked whether Team Sky should have handled the case differently, Dr Peters said: ""We could have reported it. We could have made a different decision. We'll never know in hindsight. I suppose if I'm looking at safety issues I did think there was a really big risk this lad would be pushed over the edge. I stand by my decision. ""I think I'd definitely have told them if I thought this young man was trying to cheat, but I don't think he was doing that. I think it was a panic reaction. He is making very poor decisions because he is not well, and therefore we need to treat him first of all and then get to the bottom of it. But actually to put him through some kind of investigation or disciplinary at that point could've been very serious and damaged this lad's health. ""I'm not saying that we shouldn't have reported him. We had to make a judgement call which was difficult. I don't think you could go back and think maybe we should've done it and took that risk. I don't think it was easy and I think the problem is if you look at it in black-and-white terms it makes it so that there is a right and a wrong. ""There are shades of grey. Let's be honest, none of us were comfortable but we had a lot of discussion around this and one thing we could say was he violated our rules. On the UCI technicality, he had not violated because he told us very clearly at the time that he had not done the injection because he did not know how to use the needle. This is what he told us at the time."" When asked if there were members of Team Sky's senior management who wanted to report it, Dr Peters replied: ""Yeah. We had a lot of debate and discussion. It wasn't just something we decided that we won't bother saying anything. That did not happen. It was a lot of agonising. ""We've got this in the minutes. I'm named as the person saying: 'Please stop until I make sure this young man is OK.' I was involved right from the beginning and I'm trying to explain it is a difficult one. We could have judged differently. I could've done it. I'm saying take it to me, not the team. ""We did it on good faith and decided on two counts. One, we didn't think he'd violated any rules and second and, most important, he was not in a good place."" Dr Steve Peters has also worked with Britain's Olympic cycling team, England's rugby union side and Liverpool Football Club Edmondson now claims he did tell Team Sky's senior management he had self-injected at the time, but that there was a ""cover-up"". ""I think that would have meant a bigger admission for them,"" he said. ""They'd have had to say publicly a kid was injecting. Injecting anything's bad. It's not like they were banned substances but injecting is against the rules - to self-administer anything, I believe."" Team Sky firmly deny the claim. Dr Peters said: ""It's not a cover-up. Once you use that word you are saying there was an intent behind us to conceal and that was never the case."" Edmondson also told the BBC he had severe depression after independently using controversial painkiller Tramadol. He said: ""I was depressed sometimes, because if you use it in a race and you come out of the race afterwards you're just absolutely battered. ""Tramadol makes you feel 'dead' the next day. I felt hungover. The withdrawal from the Tramadol made me feel depressed. It feels like you're hungover, so you need to to just get through and I think the withdrawal from that... just immediately after a race, I was just depressed. I felt like someone had thrown me down some stairs for a few days. ""The dangerous thing about it is you don't know when you're coming to your limit. It's not a performance-enhancing drug, it doesn't make you any better, you're not getting any more from your body, you are just pushing yourself a bit harder. ""When you're young and you are facing some kind of depression and it might be linked to some sort of drug you are definitely in denial about what that problem is - I just saw it as the stress of doing that job and training hard. I wouldn't have ever acknowledged that Tramadol was doing that. ""It was a serious problem for me especially towards the end of 2014. I didn't leave the house for two months. It doesn't get much worse than that."" Tramadol has been blamed for causing crashes in cycling by making riders drowsy, and there are concerns it may have addictive side-effects. The Mouvement pour le Cyclisme Credible, and both the UK and US Anti-Doping Agencies have called on the World Anti-Doping Agency to ban it. In 2014, former Team Sky rider Michael Barry said he and some of his team-mates had used Tramadol between 2010 and 2012. Team Sky responded by saying: ""None of our riders should ride while using Tramadol - that's the policy of this team. This has been our firm position for the last two seasons."" The team have also called for it to be banned. When asked why he chose not to tell Team Sky about his difficulties, Edmondson said: ""I was just really worried how it would look and it was a naive thing to do because I know now that if I'd gone to someone, like Dr Freeman or Wiggo [Bradley Wiggins] or anyone really, someone I'd trusted, they would have helped me, and there'd have been no problem. ""It just seemed at the time that if I'd gone to them and told them, 'I'm having this too much, I might be abusing it a little', I didn't think they would help me, just see it as a negative thing. ""I'm not trying to pass the buck. I realise I made that mistake. It was something I was doing and I don't want to be that guy moaning about how they didn't pick up on it, but if there was another rider in that position now I would want to help them and I would want there to be a system in place to help someone like that. You'd have thought there'd be a system in place to pick up on someone who's depressed, regardless of drug use."" In a statement, Team Sky said: ""We are confident we have mechanisms in place which encourage a rider to bring any issues they may be experiencing to staff in confidence. ""We are also satisfied that staff are equipped and able to raise any concerns they may have regarding a rider's welfare, and for the team to offer support."" Last year, former Team Sky riderJonathan Tiernan-Locke told the BBChe had been offered Tramadol at the 2012 World Championships in the Netherlands when riding for Great Britain. He retired recently after serving a two-year doping ban for a biological passport infringement prior to his spell at Sky. Additional reporting by Pat Nathanson and Eoin Hempsall.

"Hans Rosling, the Swedish professor who made global health statistics compelling viewing,died from cancer in February. Co-founder ofGapminder.org,external, which continues his work, he was enthusiastically trying to change old-fashioned notions of the world even as his illness took hold. In his final BBC interview - for the BBC World Service seriesEconomic Tectonics- the statistician highlighted five key ways that demographics are shaping the world around us. Why bedrooms are driving economies Why do I as a professor from public health speaking about health and demography get invited to Goldman Sachs [and] all these big banks around the world? Because I tell them I can see on my screen when economic growth comes, before you can see it. In the past, economic growth was driving demographics, and now it's the other way around. First, I see decent life coming and I see children born-per-woman drop. I see the two-child family, and I see the economic growth starting in Vietnam, in Thailandâ¦ not only in China. And this change is coming, so if you want to know where to invest in Africa go and look at demographics. Governments can't run bedrooms. Bedrooms run the world. If you have countries where the fertility rate is coming down, just segmentise the population. Look at the most educated 20% in Ghana, in Tanzania, in Ethiopia: you will find two to three children per woman. You will find an emerging China in Africa. Go there to invest if you want to earn money, if you want to have nice pensions when you retire, place part of your capital there because there you will see fast growth. Source: Gapminder.org Africa is still growing, and there's such a difference within Africa. Some African countries are doing great from different levels: Ghana, most of Ethiopia, Tanzania. They are doing great: better schooling, better health, contraceptives being available. Other tragic examples: Central African Republic, Congo, civil wars; north Nigeria, very risky, troublesome. They are delayed. They need jobs. If they get jobs, you will get stable countries, and you will get economic growth. But there's an old vision of over-population and population causing disastrous environmental effects. If we look into the middle of this century, and if Africa makes it - stability, economic growth, social progress, rights for women, stable government, they get two child families - then they will be a burden on the environment. Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2013) So an Africa that is successful will consume much more in 2050 than an Africa that is not successful. That will be a problem further on even if you manage to get down the population growth rate and Nigeria will level off at half a billion instead of one billion, Africa will level off at two billion instead of four billion. That doesn't mean that the environmental actions can rest. It's the other way around. Then, it's more urgent to take action because the rapidly successful two and a half billion in Africa, they will be a greater burden because they have money, they consume, they want bathrooms, they want refrigerators. People living longer The consequences of this are two possibilities - either those who work have to pay higher taxes or people have to work longer. Our former prime minister was bold. He told the Swedes you have to work until 75. We can't have a period between 65 and 75 where people play golf. Look at this as an opportunity. Many young couples work intensively to take care of kids, to have a professional life. The grandparents can come in. They can be more active, they are healthier, you know. There's a lot of ways in which this healthy old group of people can make a very valuable contribution to society. Source: Gapminder.org  The state retirement age for the vast majority of these countries is between 60 and 65 Whether it will be done non-monetary, to the tragedy of the minister of finance, or whether it's done by working and bringing in taxes for the greedy minister of finance, that's another thing. But it's open. It's a new situation because these older people are healthier. The period of life when you are disabled and sick and blind and cannot work, that has not increased, it has just been delayed. There is a problem with diseases like dementia and so on that takes out many healthy years, you know, but mainly there is an opportunity in this and it's just that the old systems have to change. What you see in Asia now is an amazing similarity from Japan, South Korea, the coast of China, Taiwan, Thailand. They are panicking in Singapore because the babies per woman is diving down to one. Taiwan, which we know as a country without [a] Communist party, they have one child per woman without any government policy, and China actually has 1.6. So why don't we get more babies there? I got the answer during a dinner in Hong Kong. I had lectured for a bank, and at the dinner I ended up next to the young banker who was extremely successful. She was 37 years old. She told me everything about financial trends in Asia and we got friendly with each other. So at the dessert I asked her: ""Do you have a family?"" ""Oh no,"" she said. ""I'm just working. I'm working all the time."" But I pushed on because I'm curious and said: ""Do you want to have a family?"" And she leaned backwards, looked out of the window that was the Bay of Hong Kong outside, and then she said with a smile: ""Yes, I'm thinking about children every day. It's the idea of a husband I can't stand."" I like it when one phrase can catch a trend in a whole part of the world. The educated, skilful women in Asia, from Japan to Singapore, in different political circumstances, they have been accepted and they made their way to the labour market, but they are still oppressed by old-fashioned values that they should take care of their husband and their parents-in-law. My best friend and former PhD student in Tanzania was annoyed by immigrants because a Kenyan got a job he hoped his son would get, because the Kenyan had quite good qualifications on their education system. You have today immigration in Africa from Europe because African countries are needing skilled professional people. Look at Portugal - the Portuguese are going back to Angola and Mozambique, so migration is at all skills levels. Some very skilled people need to do their work in different parts of the world, and the people at the lowest levels will also go and seek opportunities. Many people who have a big heart and haven't thought so much they may think that Western Europe can solve the problems of the world by receiving all poor people and all refugees. That won't work. I think it's good that we receive many refugees, but I'd rather have them coming with their families together rather than forcing them out on these dangerous trips where they lose all their money to criminal organisations. If we can manage migration in the world, it can benefit the person who migrates with their family, the country from where they come and the country to where they go.

"Hayatou's longevity is driving those who believe that Ahmad should be the next president The Confederation of African Football (Caf) has only ever had five presidents in its 60-year history and the last time a new leader was appointed was way back in 1988. Thursday's election in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, could herald a change, but long-time incumbent, Cameroon's Issa Hayatou, is not giving up without a fight. Hayatou, in charge for nearly three decades, has often been re-elected unopposed. On the two occasions when he did face a challenge, he won with landslides amongst the electorate of presidents of Africa's football associations. In 2000, he beat Angola's Armando Machado by 47-4 votes and four years later he defeated Ismail Bhamjee of Botswana by 46-6 votes. As he seeks an eighth term on Thursday, taking on Madagascar FA head Ahmad Ahmad, Hayatou knows that victory this time around will not come nearly as easily. Ahmad admits he is only standing after being persuaded by at least 15 FA presidents to run Whether it is reality or bluster, Ahmad says that he has been pledged more than 30 votes, which would comfortably take him over the line. His platform of administrative reform, financial transparency and a potential reorganisation of Caf competitions may be popular. But as the Malagasy freely admits what people say and what they actually do are often two very different things. Yet should Ahmad shock many by winning, the roots of his success will be able to be traced back to February 2016 when the Fifa elections took place. At that time, Caf publicly stated that it was supporting Fifa presidential candidate, and front-runner, Sheikh Salman of Bahrain and instructed all of Africa to do so as well. So when Swiss-Italian Gianni Infantino was the surprise winner, it left Caf exposed. Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem (1957-1958) Abdel Aziz Moustafa (1958-1968) Abdel Halim Muhammad (1968-1972) Yidnekatchew Tessema (1972-1987) Abdel Halim Muhammad (1987-1988) Issa Hayatou (1988-present) ""It's one of the arguments that pushed me to go for this election,"" Ahmad told me on Tuesday. Insiders say the leadership of both Fifa and Caf have been pulling in different directions ever since. This was perhaps best illustrated by Infantino attending a birthday party for Zimbabwe FA president Phillip Chiyangwa in Harare last month. An event which Caf had described, for various reasons, as an ""attempt to destabilise"" African football's ruling body. Chiywangwa is the campaign manager for Ahmad, so furthering the belief of those who claim that Fifa also wants change. What is also instructive is the paucity of African federation presidents who have been prepared to speak out publicly on Hayatou's behalf. Gianni Infantino is seen as supporting change in Caf Over the last month or so, the BBC has heard plenty from those who say they will be voting for Ahmad. Yet trying to find balance in our coverage has been tricky. Just two men, the FA presidents of Comoros and Guinea-Bissau, have been prepared to offer public support for the Cameroonian. This appears at odds with the belief that Hayatou is guaranteed another term that would extend his reign past 30 years. ""There is no one among us who can lead Caf better than Hayatou right now,"" Guinea-Bissau Football Federation president Nascimento Irenio told the BBC on Tuesday. ""You cannot compare the value that exists in this man as a leader with any other person in [African] football."" Nonetheless, Hayatou's longevity is driving those who believe that Ahmad should be the next president. ""It is clear that the winds of change are blowing in Africa,"" says Liberia FA president Musa Bility. ""We want to move forward to a new development and a new generation of leaders. This is not a campaign in which we are going to get involved in mud-slinging and bad-mouthing. We just want change."" Africa hosted its first World Cup, in South Africa in 2010, during Hayatou's presidency Whether his manifesto pledges are really appealing or, more likely, the fact that he is the sole option for change, Ahmad freely admits he is only standing after being persuaded by at least 15 FA presidents to run. Largely because the existing Caf rules state that only a member of the organisation's Executive Committee can run for the presidency. And only Ahmad, a politician back home after being both a football player and coach in his younger days, was prepared to put himself forward. Standing in his way are not just 29 years of history but also the fact that Hayatou, a former athlete himself who once held national Cameroonian sprinting records, is a political survivor. Hayatou led the expansion of teams taking part in biennial Arica Cup of Nations tournament During his time in charge, he has overseen a host of improvements to the African game but also suffered a fair share of controversies. The Africa Cup of Nations has expanded from eight teams to 16, the number of African teams at the World Cup has increased from two to five, while club competitions have been remodelled and refinanced. Caf's own finances have also been greatly been boosted . And while on his watch, the first World Cup to be staged in Africa, took place in 2010 in South Africa. There have, however, also been several question marks against the veteran. Chief among them the reprimand by the International Olympic Committee in 2011 after an ethics committee probe into the acceptance of payments from a marketing firm. But through it all, Hayatou has stayed in power, with a vice-like grip according to his critics, but that grip could well be loosening. Nonetheless, he has looked remarkably relaxed as he strolls in the corridors in his hotel in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. When I asked him for an interview on Tuesday, he accepted, but on the condition that it was done after Thursday's election. But will he be talking then as Caf president or a man who is moving on after more than four decades in sports administration?

"David Cameron gets on the Conservatives' 2015 election battlebus Money and politics. Put them together and the mix can be toxic. After long running investigations and digging by Channel 4 News and the Daily Mirror, rumblings over how the Conservative Party used cash in the General Election campaign in 2016 have burst into the open with a record fine from the Electoral Commission. Seventy thousand pounds is a lot of money, but in the context of a political campaign where millions of pounds are spent, it's not exactly going to break the Tories' bank. But the political cost of what MIGHT happen next is much higher. Tories fined Â£70k over election expenses Election expenses files passed to CPS Thirteen police forces are now looking at whether the mistakes made might constitute criminal offences. If that was to happen, there could be by-elections in seats around the country, that could seriously affect the PM's unhealthily slim majority in Parliament. And the whiff of financial wrong-doing is an odour no political party wants. But how likely is that actually to happen? On the central charge laid at the Tories' door - were they deliberately trying to channel national cash into local campaigns to get round the spending rules, the Electoral Commission report is not completely conclusive. They've found no direct evidence of intent to fiddle the system, but the message is essentially, that the party should have known better. Senior Tory sources tell me they think it's unlikely the mistakes, and there were plenty of them, will reach the hurdle for the prosecution. The CPS has to believe there is a good chance of a successful conviction, and while this is speculation, senior Tories don't believe in most of the cases that's likely. When it comes to South Thanet however, the seat where the Conservatives were desperate to hold off Nigel Farage, Tory insiders fear the situation may be more fraught for them. The discrepancies may be more serious, the amounts of money more significant, and therefore, potentially, this could bring a lot more trouble in the coming months. The Tories aren't the only party to have messed up their election expenses, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also been fined. But it's most serious for the Tories and could, hypothetically, cause a significant amount of political pain.

"A leading African writer has transfixed the internet with her comments on gender - but fellow Nigerians say they feel hurt. Transgender women in Africa have benefited from ""male privilege"" because they grew up as men.

"Nuclear threats, contested territory, and a looming trade dispute await the new secretary of state in Asia The new US secretary of state is heading off on his first trip to Asia, where diplomatic tensions run high. Rex Tillerson, who has no previous political experience, will be visiting countries in the shadow of North Korea's nuclear programme. Global superpower China may be the key to that problem, and to stability in the region, but relations with the US are strained at the moment, partly over comments Mr Tillerson himself has made. His first true test as a diplomat is a potential powder keg. So is the former oil boss up to the task? This video can not be played Tillerson's folksy introduction to his department: 'Hi, I'm the new guy'. Rex Tillerson has kepta remarkably low profilein his first month or so in office, giving no press briefings in six weeks, and sticking to prepared statements. Any hopes that reporters might see him in action on this Asia trip were dashed, however, when it emerged he wouldn't be bringing the state department press corps along. Instead, Mr Tillerson will be taking a single reporter from a conservative website, the Independent Journal Review - because of the small plane being used, the state department said. The journalist, Erin McPike, recently wrote about Tillerson in a piece on ""Exxon Mobil's special treatment from the White House,external"". Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Will Trump let Tillerson take control? Tillerson 'used alias' in climate emails The trip is seen as important because Mr Tillerson will be trying to conduct high-level diplomacy in a region shaken by his president's public comments. Donald Trump has tweeted that China needs to be ""taken on,external"" and decried the country's ""military complex,external"" in the South China Sea. The president has said that South Korea ""makes a fortune on us,external"" while the US defends it, and has accused Japan of ""currency manipulation,external"". Such remarks have led to uncertainty in the region about the direction of US foreign policy, something Mr Tillerson will have to deal with. Mr Tillerson's trip starts with Japan, which is likely to be the easiest leg of the journey. He is scheduled to meet the foreign minister, as well as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - who Trump has already met, and ""had a great time,external"" with. But the military threat from North Korea is likely to dominate the discussion. This video can not be played How do you solve a problem like North Korea? The secretive isolationist nation has continued its development of nuclear weapons despite sanctions and threats from the international community. Two nuclear explosion tests and more than 20 missile launches in the past year have increased tensions. Both Japan and South Korea, which are US military allies and host US troops, are within missile distance of North Korea. But it is China, as North Korea's only ally on earth, which holds the power to affect change. Donald Trump has accused China of ignoring the North Korea situation, and essentially allowing it to worsen. But Beijing has taken relatively strong steps in recent weeks. Early in March, it asked Pyongyang tostop its missile tests to ""defuse a looming crisis"", and earlier dealt its allya severe economic blow by banning coal imports. Mr Tillerson is likely to urge China to do even more. But at the same time, he'll have to smooth over another row that the US is involved in. The United States has deployed the Thaad missile defence system (that's Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) in South Korea to defend it from nuclear attack. Unfortunately, the missile defence system's radar is extremely long range, extending into China. ""It's incredible the speed with which China's leaders can just switch on anti-South Korea sentiment here,"" the BBC's China Correspondent, Stephen McDonnell,said in a blog post this week. China's development of artificial islands with defensive capabilities in the South China Sea is deeply controversial. ""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed,"" Mr Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January, likening it to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. China says its building is legitimate and its military facilities are for self-defence ""They are taking territory or control or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully China's,"" he said, in remarks that might be welcomed by Japan and others who contest China's territorial claims. But it makes the delicate negotiation with China that much harder. For China's part, state-controlled mediawarned Mr Tillerson that such actions could cause ""devastating confrontation""or even ""a large-scale war"". A rather more emollient foreign minister told his annual news conference in Beijing that Mr Tillerson ""is a person who is willing to listen and is a deep communicator."" Even if Mr Tillerson can bring calm to the South China Sea dispute and persuade Beijing to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, there's still one more problem - an economic one. One of President Trump's first actions was to pull out of theTrans-Pacific Partnership, which would have opened up trade with Japan and 11 other nations by reducing tariffs.That's good news for China, which saw the TPP as an effort to contain its economic might, but means Japan needs to start over. And China has its own problems with US trade policy. This video can not be played Donald Trump is likely to tear up the old rulebook of how trade deals are done, says Anthony Scaramucci During the election campaign, Mr Trump floated the idea of a 45% tariff on goods from China, and in January, a senior academic adviser warned the current trade deal was ""more favourable to China than us"". Anthony Scaramucci told the BBC a trade war is ""going to cost them way more than it is ever going to cost us, and I think they know that."" And while the relationship with South Korea may have long been stable, the country is in the depths of a major political crisis following the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. She had been a long-time supporter of US foreign policy in the region, particularly when it came to isolating North Korea. South Korea's presidential possibles Profile: South Korean President Park Geun-hye But the current frontrunner to replace her, Moon Jae-in, has suggested a new approach might be required in handling North Korea - and has voiced concern about the US deployment of the Thaad defence system in the South. With so many competing interests in economic and territorial disputes, and a looming military threat, Mr Tillerson will have to thread the diplomatic needle carefully - weighing each nation's goals against the desire of the US, and everyone else involved, for regional stability.
