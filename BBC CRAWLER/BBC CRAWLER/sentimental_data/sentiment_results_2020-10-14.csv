"With the world gripped by the coronavirus pandemic it's been easy to lose track of what's happening with Brexit. Big changes will happen from 1 January, but the UK and the EU are running out of time to agree the new rules. Here are nine significant moments from this year. At 23:00 GMT on 31 Januarythe UK officially left the EU- nearly four years after the public vote took place. Brexit supporters celebrated in London's Parliament Square, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to bring the country together and ""take us forward"". But the UK did not immediately cut all of its EU ties. The UK went into atransition periodthat meant continuing to follow EU rules until 31 December 2020. The transition was to allow both sides some breathing space while further UK-EU talks take place. The outcome of these negotiations will determine the rules for the new UK-EU relationship - including on trade -  which will start on 1 January 2021. What is the transition period? The new negotiations got under way in Brussels on 2 March. Leading the talks for the UK was David Frost, who arrived with 100 advisers and government officials. At the opposite end of the table was Michel Barnier - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. The biggest issue was a trade deal - everything from lorries crossing borders to financial services rules. But there was plenty of other stuff to discuss - security co-operation and medicine safety being examples. Both sides say they want to avoid tariffs, which are taxes on goods that cross a border. But the UK wants to set all of its own rules and the EU says it doesn't want changes to the rules that mean the UK has an unfair advantage. With the coronavirus crisis taking centre stage, little progress was made with the trade talks. Two major sticking points emerged: Fishing:Both sides disagreed on how much access EU boats should have to UK waters. State aid:Under current EU rules, countries are not allowed to give money to save failing companies. The UK argued it should be allowed (now that it's not in the EU) to spend state aid money on whatever it wants. However, the EU said the UK should follow the current rules so that its businesses would not gain an unfair advantage over EU competitors. Frustration was growing on both sides and on 21 August Mr Barnier told a press conference thatthe chance of an EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal ""seems unlikely""while Lord Frost said the EU had made things ""unnecessarily difficult"". In a further sign that talks were in trouble, Lord Frost told the Mail on Sunday thatthe UK was not scared to walk awayand urged the EU to ""take our position seriously"". If talks do fail then charges - known as tariffs - would be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU. That could make UK goods more expensive in the EU. Tariffs on EU goods coming into the UK would also be introduced. Full border checks would also be needed and businesses have voiced their fears thatthis would cause long lorry queues at portsand lead to significant trade disruption around the country. Both sides want to continue to trade with zero tariffs and not bring in too many extra checks - but that will require a trade deal. The UK also wants services - everything from accountancy to education - included in any deal. Brexit: a simple guide What are the sticking points? In September, the UK government proposed changes that it acknowledged would break international law in a ""specific and limited way"". The Brexit deal negotiated in 2019 - known as the withdrawal agreement - established new checks on goods travelling from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This was to prevent checks from having to take place along the Irish border after the transition ends. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis said Northern Ireland customs rules legislation would âbreak international law in a very specific and limited wayâ However, the UK government said it wanted to make changes to the previously-agreed arrangement in order to bring clarity and avoid disruption from 1 January. In response,the EU announced it had started legal proceedings against the UK. Despite this, the EU said it would not walk away from the trade talks. What changes is the government planning? What is the Northern Ireland protocol? A ""historic moment"" was how International Trade Secretary Liz Truss described thesigning of the UK's first major trade deal since it left the EU. Brexit supporters said the Japan agreement showed that the UK could negotiate better deals than the EU and that further ones would follow. Critics, however, said it was more important to remain close to the EU and that the Japan deal largely replicated the deal the EU already had. US presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"". In the tweet sent on 16 September, Mr Biden also said there would be no future US-UK trade deal if border checks returned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With no breakthrough in the trade talks, the UK government unveiled how it would handle a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" where queues of 7,000 trucks could clog up roads around the port of Dover and Channel Tunnel from 1 January. To avoid this, the government said it would introducea new permit systemfor lorries entering Kent. This would be to prevent lorries without the right paperwork from travelling into the county and attempting to ferry goods to the EU. Seven things that will change on 1 January 2021 With less than 100 days before the new relationship was due to begin,Mr Johnson said that a deal was ""all there""and that it was up to the EU to get it across the line. The EU said while agreement had been reached in a number of technical areas, such as aviation safety, there were still some serious differences to overcome. If a trade deal doesn't happen then contingency measures, in areas like medicine safety, could be introduced. This would be to try to cushion some of the worst disruption that could begin on 1 January. What happens now that a deal's been done? What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"Disappointed Quality Street customers have taken to social media to complain that the selection is lacking a crucial ingredient. ""Where are the Chocolate Caramel Brownies?! My 8yr old son is devastated,"" wrote one. Another customer complained they had been given extra Orange Cremes. The company said that its manufacturing process was adversely affected during lockdown, resulting in a narrower range in some tins. ""In order to keep Quality Street production going during the Covid-19 lockdown period, we made some temporary changes to the way we operated, such as running fewer lines for a time,"" a spokesperson for Nestle said. While there was no change to the overall weight being sold, the range had been affected, she said. ""As a result, some consumers may find that they do not have all 12 varieties of Quality Street sweets in their mix."" The full range of chocolates was being produced and incorporated into more recent boxes, she added. ""We apologise for any disappointment caused but hope consumers understand why it was necessary to make these changes during such unprecedented conditions,"" the spokeswoman said.

The limited edition Chocolate Caramel Brownies were removed from production for four weeks earlier this year. When the lockdown was at its height, a number of factory workers were shielding or looking after children, which was why Nestle made the change. The Quality Street chocolates that are normally in a tin include a mix of: The Purple One Fudge Coconut Ãclair Strawberry Delight Orange Creme Orange Crunch Toffee Penny Toffee Finger Caramel Swirl Green Triangle Milk Choc Block Other manufacturers have also been affected by the coronavirus crisis. In June, Marmite-owner Unilever saidproduction of its spreadwas hit by a shortage of brewer's yeast after pubs were closed in March during lockdown. But in the main, food producers around the world have said they have too much stockas restaurants and others areas of hospitality close for business.

"New measures announced by Boris Johnson this week fell short of advice provided by scientists Documents have revealed the UK government did not follow the advice given to it by scientists as coronavirus cases began to surge. The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) is a committee attended by scientists across a range of fields. While its members may not individually agree, their role is to look at the evidence, work out what it is suggesting, and present an agreed view to the government. It's then for the politicians to decide what rules to make. Thepapers, which date from 21 September,external, were published on Monday night. They set out in black and white what scientists thought should happen on a number of important topics. What scientists recommended: They did not go as far as recommending a full lockdown on the scale of the one in the spring. This was also an outcome Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been extremely keen to avoid. Their evidence said:The effect of a full lockdown, including closing non-essential businesses and banning contact between households, was clear: it would have had a big impact on coronavirus cases and deaths. But it would also have had a large knock-on impact - hurting people in other ways, such as their ability to work and socialise. What happened:The government opted for a three-tier system in England, with household mixing indoors banned only in the areas of highest concern. Businesses will broadly remain open. What they recommended:Sage said government should consider a short lockdown of two or three weeks, immediately, to bring down the number of cases. Their evidence said:There were solid grounds to suggest this would have had ""similar levels of effectiveness"" to that of the national spring lockdown, in turning the tide of the pandemic. But its shorter period would have limited the overall effects - there would almost certainly have been fewer deaths but the line on the graph would look less dramatic. You would also have had to wait until after the restrictions had been lifted to see any benefit, since it takes time for the infections that would have been prevented to translate to lower hospital admissions and deaths. What happened:This idea was rejected by No 10 in favour of an option that keeps businesses open and household contact going for most of the country, but with the threat that such privileges could be taken away if cases rise. Now Labour leader Keir Starmer has called on the government to think again. What they recommended:The scientists recommended people be advised to work from home if they could. Their evidence said:This would have been likely to make a significant dent in transmission as about a third of people's total contacts are made at work. But this will vary drastically by industry - and how much it would have dented the current transmission depends on how many people currently at work could have done their job from home. What happened:Those who can are once again being advised to work from home, in a reversal of the government's drive over summer to encourage more people back to the workplace . What they recommended:The advisory group said government should consider immediately putting a stop to contact between households, unless they were part of a support bubble. Their evidence said:Being in an enclosed space, breathing the same air and touching the same surfaces, makes mixing indoors a high risk activity. Much of this risk is shared with people you live with, where cutting contact is not really possible. But spreading the virus to other households is what allows the epidemic to be sustained - though scientists say restrictions on different mixing would have been less effective in areas with lots of intergenerational households, where young and old mix within the same bubble. What happened:Mixing with other households indoors has been banned for people living in areas on ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. Outdoor mixing is allowed in groups of no more than six. What they recommended:Sage said government should consider the immediate closure of closure of all bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms, and ""personal services"", for example hairdressers. The evidence said:The risk in bars, restaurants and cafes was ""likely to be higher than many other indoor settings"" as people sit close together for long periods without wearing face coverings, and potentially talk loudly, risking spraying more virus into the air. Alcohol also affects people's behaviour. The scientists pointed to multiple outbreaks linked to bars - but also indicated the evidence suggested curfews were likely to have only a ""marginal impact"". What happened:The government largely rejected the advice. Most of England can continue going to pubs and restaurants, although since cases began to spike, a 22:00 curfew has been ordered. In ""very high"" alert areas, pubs and bars must close unless they are operating like a restaurant and only serving alcohol as part of a sit-down meal. What they recommended:Sage recommended all university and college teaching should be carried out online ""unless absolutely essential"", but schools should continue in person. It's possible a ""circuit-breaker"" could be timed to coincide with school holidays. The evidence said:Closing schools, particularly secondary schools, might have had a moderate impact on transmission but would come with a high level of harm for children's education and their own and their parents' wellbeing. For adult students, the impact on transmission was considered to be higher and the harm to health and social equality lower. What happened:Schools and universities remain open - although many universities are beginning to move teaching online anyway due to outbreaks.

"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales.

Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant?

The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed.

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster announces the new restrictions in Northern Ireland Schools will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday evening, in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. The moves are amongnew restrictions being imposed,externalby the executive. It comes as NI's Department of Health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Hospitality businesses will be limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday. Health officials had warned infections would rise further if both schools and hospitality premises remained open. Northern Ireland's health department has now recorded 23,115 cases since the pandemic began - a quarter of which have been reported in the past week. The executive has agreed schools will close for two weeks, including the half-term holiday, until Monday 2 November, when their closure will be reviewed. Education Minister Peter Weir vowed to oppose any move to extend school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. He said lengthening the Halloween mid-term break by a further week of holiday represented a ""compromise"" position within the Stormont Executive. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure but they were ""content"" with the decision. NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external Coronavirus Q&A: What has changed in NI? 'I think we're done' - Restaurant and bar owners react Sports hit by tighter measures Mrs Foster outlined the changes in a statement to assembly members. Further guidance is being issued that will also advise against unnecessary travel, and the executive will meet on Thursday to discuss further support packages for businesses concerned about what closures will mean for jobs and viability. Talks ran into the early hours of Wednesday as ministers tried to reach a compromise on a range of decisions, finally agreeing to impose the following measures for four weeks from Friday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households,other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.Â Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services -  prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting While there was no specific mention of hotels, it is understood they will also be closing for four weeks. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she was ""urgently engaging with executive colleagues to clarify the specifics of these new restrictions, and the potential impact on hotels, before they come into effect"". There is also likely to be more guidance on the likes of soft play areas, cinemas and swimming pools. There are new restrictions coming into place for weddings, civil ceremonies and funerals, which will be limited to 25 people from Monday with no receptions permitted. Face coverings will not be obligatory for such ceremonies in places of worship. Ministers have agreed no additional restrictions will be placed on shops, but there will be ""urgent engagement"" with the sector about extra measures to prevent further spread of the virus. Driving lessons will be allowed to continue. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds The current restrictions on household mixing are expected to remain as they are. That would mean no mixing of households in private homes - with exceptions including those joined in social bubbles - and gatherings in gardens limited to six people from no more than two households. Mrs Foster said the executive hoped the measures would reduce virus transmission rates, while reinforcing public health messaging. ""A lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention,"" she told the assembly. She also told the assembly there had been 485 coronavirus-related incidents schools - many involving a single case - and fewer than 10 schools required support for more than two cases. ""There are other issues around school gates and transport and issues like that but we are going to work with the education department about how we can minimise risks,"" she added. White smoke emerged shortly after 00:30 - the tradition of late Stormont nights making a return once more. Ministers had reconvened at 23:00 after tensions erupted earlier, with the SDLP and Alliance complaining they had been given too little time to scrutinise the proposals. One source said when the meeting first got under way, the atmosphere was ""horrendous"", but when ministers returned for the second time it's understood tempers had calmed and the midnight meeting was a more sombre affair. The nature of decision-making at Stormont sees five parties sharing power in a mandatory coalition - and their views have differed greatly at times during the pandemic. It appears the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in reached a compromise over the timing of school closures - for now - and whether to apply hospitality measures throughout Northern Ireland. Advice from health officials was that NI-wide restrictions had to be imposed by Friday. The executive seems to have listened to that recommendation, but some are asking why the parties laboured so long over the proposed plan, given the urgency of the situation. But these are seismic decisions: every step back into what resembles the original lockdown has ramifications. Ministers will also be facing questions about why they appear to have chosen to diverge from some of the health officials' original advice. Readmore from Jayne. The executive has also agreed to advise universities and further education colleges to run courses online. Queen's University Belfast has confirmed teaching will be carried out online for the rest of the semester, unless face-to-face work is considered ""essential or unavoidable."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who is self-isolating after a relative tested positive for coronavirus, said there would be no changes to childcare arrangements. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said the executive had given ""painstaking consideration"" to next steps. ""We will do everything we possibly can to make sure there are protections in place for businesses, workers and families,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The prime minister and Labour leader clashed over coronavirus policy A new three-tier system of regional Covid-19 restrictions in England ""is the right way forward"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM told the House of Commons the policy ""can bring down the virus"" but that he did not rule out going further. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer again called for a ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, limited lockdown in England to bring the virus under control. He said such a move was supported by government science advisers. The PM said he hoped the three-tier system would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". He added: ""I rule out nothing of course in combating the virus, but we are going to do it with the local, the regional approach that can drive down and will drive down the virus, if it is properly implemented."" It comes as Wales prepares to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirusfrom travelling to the countryfrom 18:00 BST on Friday. On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Five unanswered questions about the new system Laura Kuenssberg: Can Johnson hold out against more restrictions? The new tier system has begun in England, with the Liverpool region the first to enter the highest alert level. The BBC understands that a meeting of the Joint Biosecsurity Centre (JBC) has suggested that Greater Manchester alongside much of north-west and north-east England, large parts of Yorkshire and parts of the Midlands should also be moved into the highest tier. The JBC recommendations will not necessarily be enforced and discussions are likely to continue between local and national politicians and officials over the coming days. Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham had a meeting with deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and said further talks are to take place on Thursday morning with the ""PM's team"". Most of the country is in the lowest tier - medium - but millions of people in the North and the Midlands are currently in the second highest tier and face extra curbs on households mixing. Schools, close-contact services and all retail outlets will remain open under basic measures, even in the highest alert areas. In other developments: Schools in Northern Ireland will close from Monday and pubs and restaurantsface new restrictions on Friday Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of Englandas she singled out Blackpool as ""associated with a large and growing number of Covid cases in Scotland"". Passengers arriving in the UK from at-risk countries might be able to avoid having to quarantine as part of a number of options being considered by the government. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told a travel conference the plan could involve private Covid testing or a period of self-isolation before departure Local politicians in Greater Manchester have argued against the region being put into the highest tier saying that without increased financial support they would prefer a circuit-breaker. Mr Burnham said he would consider a legal challenge if the government placed the area in Tier 3 restrictions, adding such a move would be ""by imposition, not consent"". But Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said he was not in support of a circuit-breaker at this time. Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he and Mr Burnham were also considering legal action against the newjob support scheme. He said it appeared ""discriminatory"" that No 10 had offered to pay 80% of workers' pay in March under the furlough scheme while the latest help is providing two-thirds of wages to employees of businesses made to close under the restrictions.

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         By political correspondent Leila Nathoo The approach of targeting different restrictions at different parts of England has exposed a rift between Westminster and some local politicians, who have called for more say over what's happening in their areas. Under pressure to say why he has so far rejected the idea of a national ""circuit-break"" period, Boris Johnson was keen to stress that the current package of measures could bring down transmission IF there was co-operation at a local level and proper enforcement. More involvement for local leaders means more responsibility for things going well - or badly. For now, the PM seems determined to continue to try to tread this middle path - mindful also perhaps of the chunk of his own MPs concerned about even the current range of restrictions and the impact on the economy. The risk is that he may have lost valuable time, if he does decide to change course. The Labour leader'sinitial call for a circuit-breaker in Englandcame on Tuesday. Sir Keir said such a course of action would help buy time to ""save lives, fix testing, and save the NHS"". Schools would kept open as normal because it would be timed to coincide with the October half term. However, Sir Keir said ""all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed"" and compensated. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said Mr Johnson had rejected the advice of government science advisers, whohad suggested a circuit-breaker when they met on 21 September. Separately, a scientific report has suggested a two-week circuit-breaker at the end of this monthmay halve coronavirus deaths between now and the end of the year. The researchers said the measure ""buys more time to put other controls in place"", but there is huge uncertainty over some of their predictions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? RULES:What can and can't you do where you live? But, responding to Sir Keir's comments, the PM told MPs the three-tier system was an ""opportunity to keep things going, to keep our kids in schools, to keep our businesses going"" and the ""logical thing to do"". ""That, I think, is what the people of this country want to do. This is our opportunity to do that and suppress the virus where it is surging,"" he said. The PM said the disease was now ""appearing much more strongly"" in some parts of the country than others so a different approach was needed to that taken earlier in the year. He highlighted the fact there were 670 coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents in the Liverpool region, compared with 33 per 100,000 in Cornwall.

"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.

Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit.

"Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran (L) and Prime Minister Jean Castex are reportedly under investigation French police have raided the homes of senior government and health officials as part of an investigation into their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran and the director of the national health agency, JÃ©rÃ´me Salomon, are among those whose properties were searched on Thursday. The raids came after a court launched an inquiry earlier this year into the government's handling of the pandemic. It has faced criticism over shortages of equipment and slow response times. Prime Minister Jean Castex is also under investigation, French media report, as is his predecessor Edouard Philippe and Mr VÃ©ran's predecessor AgnÃ¨s Buzyn. The prime minister and Mr VÃ©ran have been at the forefront of France's new policy of imposing night-time curfews in nine cities, including Paris, from Saturday, which will be enforced by 12,000 police. ""This means at 21:00 everyone must be at home and, without exception, every place, business or public service open to the public will be shut,"" Mr Castex said on Thursday. WHO: Europe restrictions 'absolutely necessary' How to tell which countries are coping best Tracking the global outbreak In July, the court launched the inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemicafter members of the public, including doctors and relatives of victims, alleged that it had been criminally negligent in its response to Covid-19. The special court hears cases of alleged wrongdoing by ministers and other government officials in the course of their duties. But for the claims to be substantiated, there would have to be evidence that officials knowingly failed to take obvious steps that would have saved lives. This video can not be played Emmanuel Macron said the curfew would last for four weeks but could be extended At a news conference on Thursday, Prime Minister Castex said he had ""absolute"" confidence in both Mr VÃ©ran and Mr Salomon. A further 22,951 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Wednesday. ""We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus,"" Mr Macron said in a television address. The president added that this wave of Covid-19 was different to the outbreak in the spring because the virus had spread to all parts of France. France managed to control the first outbreak by introducing a national lockdown. It then opened bars and restaurants in the summer, and allowed foreign tourists to visit as part of an effort to boost the ailing economy. Schools reopened and universities began teaching classes in person in early autumn. But since August the number of reported cases has accelerated quickly. Wednesday was the third time in six days that France reported more than 20,000 new infections. Mr Macron said the new measures aimed to reduce daily cases to around 3,000. As with the first wave of Covid-19, there is concern that hospitals and intensive care units will become overwhelmed with patients. The curfew, from 21:00 to 06:00, will apply for at least four weeks to Paris and its suburbs as well as Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Saint-Etienne, Rouen, Toulouse, Grenoble and Montpellier. Affecting around 22 million people, it will be applied for four weeks to begin with and Mr Macron's government will seek to extend it to six. President Macron said the virus has spread to all parts of France now The measures will stop people visiting restaurants and private homes during the evening and night-time. Private parties will be banned, even in areas not under curfew, from midnight on Friday. But there is some scepticism over how effective the curfew might be. ""People were mainly going out to eat out which they will continue to do... until 9pm,"" Lou Mielot, a student at the University of Lyon, told the BBC. ""This will create restaurants that are full from 7pm to 9pm, [where people] won't be able to keep a safe distance,"" she added. Residents will need a valid reason to be outside their homes during the hours of curfew. President Macron said on Wednesday night he understood a curfew was a ""hard"" thing to ask people to do. On Thursday, Mr Castex said travel during hours of curfew was permitted for trips to the hospital or pharmacy, or if work hours required. But a special certificate would need to be produced as proof. Pre-booked tickets for planes and trains that arrive after the curfew will be allowed. Anyone found breaking the curfew will be fined â¬135 (Â£121). Businesses that suffer financially due to the new measures will be eligible for state aid. Any company with up to 50 staff in the nine cities affected will be eligible for help if their turnover has fallen by over half in the past year. All companies in curfew areas will be asked to move towards having employees work from home for at least part of the week, and to stagger working hours. President Macron has already suggested ""tele-working"" for two or three days a week. ""We're in the second wave,"" the president said. For many people his address will have sounded distressingly similar to what he had to say at the start of wave one. Situation dire; hospitals under threat; public failing to get it; action. Of course there are huge differences. Today we know so much more. We wear masks and get tested. Doctors have better treatments. And another national lockdown - like the one in March - has been ruled out. But suddenly it feels like we are back where we began. Just as in March, we are warned of a virus that has become rampant and can only be stopped with drastic action.  Just as in March, we're told the health system risks being swamped. People will accept the curfew. What choice do they have? But it feels like the start of a long, miserable winter. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Twice as many men die from drug-related deaths, but cocaine deaths among women surged last year Drug-related deaths reached their highest level for a quarter of a century last year as the number of women who died after using cocaine surged. Figures showed 4,393 people died in England and Wales from drug poisoning. Cocaine deaths increased for the eighth year running, rising by 7.7% for men and 26.5% for women. The Office for National Statistics said the overall death rate for men was twice as high as for women, however. About two-thirds of all deaths from drug poisoning were due to drug misuse, the ONS said - meaning the underlying cause was drug abuse or addiction, or they involved illegal drugs. Overall, deaths rose only slightly from 4,359 registered in 2018 to 4,393 registered in 2019. But that figure is the highest since records began in 1993. Men accounted for 2,968 drug-related deaths - more than two out of three - while 1,425 were women. 'Surprise and disappointment' at UK drug response 'I'm using more coke and ecstasy in lockdown' Opiates such as heroin and morphine were involved in more than half of deaths where the drug type was known. The ONS said rates of drug poisoning have been on a ""steep upward trend"" since 2012 due to rises in heroin and cocaine deaths. In 2018, there were 637 registered deaths involving cocaine - including 117 women and 520 men. In 2019 there were 708 deaths - 148 women and 560 men. Taking age into account, the death rate for men declined slightly in 2019, while for women it increased for the tenth consecutive year. Prof Julia Sinclair, chairwoman of the addictions faculty of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said years of cuts had left services ill-equipped to prevent drug deaths. ""The tragic number of drug-related deaths should be all the evidence the government needs to substantially invest in addiction services, before more lives are needlessly lost,"" she said. Niamh Eastwood, director of drug policy charity Release, said two Parliamentary committees - the Health and Social Care Select Committee and the Scottish Affairs Select Committee - had called for reform of drug policy to tackle these deaths. The health committee recommended ""non-judgemental harm reduction"" policies andcalled for a consultation on decriminalising drug possession for personal use,external. She said the prime minister and home secretary should ""stop playing politics and listen to the evidence"". Death rates were highest in deprived areas, with people in their 40s living in the poorest neighbourhoods at least five-and-a-half times more likely to die from drugs than those in the least deprived, the ONS said. The north-east of England had the highest drug-related death rate, almost three times higher than the area with the lowest rate in 2019, the east of England. ""Investment in these communities, adequate housing, restoring benefits to a decent level, along with drug policy and harm reduction initiatives can save lives,"" Ms Eastwood said. The age at which most people died from drug use is increasing, the ONS said, from 20 to 29-year-olds from 1993 to 2002 to 40 to 49-year-olds today. It is ""possible"" that a generation born in the 1960s and 1970s, Generation X, has been dying in greater numbers from drug misuse over time, the ONS said. The figures include deaths from all drugs, including prescription and over-the-counter medications. They also include accidents and suicides involving drugs, as well as complications from injecting drugs such as deep vein thrombosis and blood poisoning. About half of the deaths registered last year will have occurred in previous years, statisticians believe, due to the time it can take for an inquest to be held.

"Boris Johnson will decide on the ""next steps"" for post-Brexit trade talks after an EU summit later this week, Downing Street has said. No 10 said the PM expressed ""disappointment"" at recent progress in a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday. Mr Johnson has previously set Thursday's meeting of EU leaders as the deadline for a deal. Mrs von der Leyen said the EU wanted a deal, ""but not at any price"". Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are locked in talks over striking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Brexit: Time for trade deal getting short, PM warns Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? A No 10 spokesperson said Mr Johnson ""noted the desirability of a deal"" during his pre-summit call with Mrs von der Leyen. However, the PM also ""expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks,"" they added. ""The prime minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council and would reflect before setting out the UK's next steps."" Earlier, a No 10 spokesman said fishing rights remained the ""starkest"" point of difference ahead of Thursday's two-day EU leaders' summit. The government's chief Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost was seen going into Downing Street on Thursday morning. Backbench Conservative Peter Bone told MPs Lord Frost was briefing the prime minister ""on whether to continue the negotiations or whether to call it a day and prepare for a no-trade deal Brexit"". Speaking after her call with the prime minister, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""The EU is working on a deal, but not at any price."" She added that ""conditions must be right"" on fishing, post-Brexit competition rules and how a deal is enforced for the EU to sign an agreement. She added: ""Still a lot of work ahead of us."" European Council President Charles Michel also joined the call with Mrs von der Leyen and the Mr Johnson on Wednesday evening. In a letter to EU leaders ahead of Thursday's meeting, Mr Michel said reaching a deal before December was ""in the interests of both sides"". He added that as well as fishing rights, ""key issues"" for a deal included post-Brexit rules on competition and how a deal would be enforced. EU leaders are not yet all on the same page when it comes to how much they should give up or give in to get a deal. Brussels keeps calling on the UK to make concessions but a successful outcome will require compromises on both sides. Will France's Emmanuel Macron relinquish his hard-line position about keeping current fishing quotas in UK waters? He'll have to, to get a UK deal. Will Germany's Angela Merkel give way on some demands on competition regulations (aka the level playing field) yet still grant the UK zero tariff, zero quota access to the single market? EU leaders must agree all this amongst themselves and it won't be straightforward. Read more from Katya here. Over the summer, both the UK and EU seemed to agree the end of October was the final date to get a deal done - allowing enough time for it to be ratified before 31 December. But come 7 September, Boris Johnson decided to shorten the deadline. Hesaid,externalif a deal wasn't reached by 15 October, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". Thursday is that day - but Downing Street appears to have moved back from it as a hard deadline. Formal negotiations ended at the start of October, but Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen pledged to ""intensify talks"" over the coming weeks. Pressed on whether the UK would walk away on 15 October, the government's chief negotiator Lord Frost said it was his job to ""advise the prime minister"" on whether a deal was on the cards by then. Speaking on Tuesday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian suggested EU leaders do not see this week as a hard deadline for a breakthrough. ""The date of 15 October, it's Prime Minister Boris Johnson who announced that, it is not the position of the European Council,"" he told French MPs. He added that ""everything should be played out"" between October 15 and ""mid-November"". He warned that the prospect of no deal was ""unfortunately very likely,"" but the EU was ""prepared for all eventualities"". By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization.

"This video can not be played ""Idiots"" gather in Liverpool on eve of new Covid rules Pictures of large crowds gathering in Liverpool two hours before new Covid-19 restrictions came into effect ""shame our city"", its mayor has said. Footage on social media showed people dancing and surrounding a police car in Concert Square at 22:00 BST. Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of the government's new system of restrictions. Mayor Joe Anderson said ignoring facts about the virus was ""why we are in Tier 3 measures"". The new rules mean pubs in the city regionnot serving meals must stay shut, along with gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos. The crowds gathered as nearby bars closed but police said they were dispersed quickly and safely, although 38 fixed penalty notices were issued for breaching coronavirus legislation. Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of the government's new system of coronavirus restrictions Liverpool has the third highest infection rate in England Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke said he was ""absolutely livid"" when he saw the scenes and described those involved as ""selfish, dangerous and childish"". He said the ""vast majority"" of people were abiding by the rules but those who were ""blatantly disregarding the law"" were putting extra pressure on the force. Liverpool currently has the third highest rate of infections in England with 635 cases per 100,000 of population up until 10 October, behind Nottingham which has 880 and Knowsley with 667.5. Paul Brant, cabinet member for adult health and social care, said intensive care beds in the city were at more than 90% capacity and were soon expected to reach or exceed the levels of occupancy seen during the first wave. He added: ""At the current rate of increase, we would expect Liverpool to surpass the peak of the first wave probably within the next seven to 10 days."" Mr Anderson, reacting to footage circulating of the crowds on social media, tweeted: ""These pictures shame our city."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He added: ""Our health service is creaking, 300 in hospital & 30 people dead in [a] week. Ignoring these facts is why we are in Tier 3 measures."" Mr Anderson, who previously called for a circuit-breaker lockdown, questioned whether the measures would be enough to tackle the ""uncontrollable"" spread of the virus and called for unity. ""This city is in a Covid crisis. It's an enemy we are really finding it hard to get on top of and defeat,"" he said. ""We need to keep working together and pulling together."" City councillor Nick Small said those involved were ""idiots putting themselves, their friends, families and everyone else at risk, destroying jobs and our hospitality sector while they do it"". Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said hospitals in the city faced a ""dire situation"". He appeared in a video message issued by the city council and urged the public to ""please pay great attention to the regulations that are being brought in"". Prof Semple said: ""We have got over 300 patients in beds and our intensive care capacity is currently running at 90%. ""At this rate we are looking at exceeding healthcare capacity in the next week or so."" In the top tier of the new restrictions pubs not serving meals must stay shut Richard Kemp, leader of the city's Liberal Democrat group, warned against scapegoating Liverpool's young people for something involving ""at most 300"" people. ""What they did was wrong and they should be ashamed of their behaviour,"" he said. ""However, we have 60,000 students in our city and a very large number of our resident population under 25. ""This means that 99.99% of the city's young people behaved themselves last night and should be congratulated for their restraint."" Liverpool musician Ian McNabb took to social media to support youngsters ""partying loud and hard on the last night before the shutdown"". ""If I was 18 I'd be right there with them,"" the former frontman of the Icicle Works posted on his Facebook page. Ch Supt Peter Costello, of Merseyside Police, said: ""While we understand the new rules are frustrating for some, we would continue to advise everyone to abide by them - including keeping social distancing - for the safety of everyone."" Meanwhile, a number ofgyms in Merseyside are defying the orderto close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical well-being."" Gym owner Mick Povall says if gyms do not get to open soon he might never reopen One gym owner who has closed his business said it was a ""huge blow not just for myself but for the people in the local community who come here"". Mick Povall, owner of Gravity Health and Fitness in Upton, Wirral, said: ""The government carries on about the importance of improving mental health and avoiding obesity during the pandemic and then in the same breath shuts down one of the best tools to achieve those goals.

Updates were brought to you by Claire Heald, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Cheetham, Lauren Turner, Mal Siret and Sophie Williams. It's been another busy day of coronavirus developments, with the latest being the new measures in France. Here's what else has been happening both in the UK and across the world this Wednesday.   Almost an hour into his TV appearance tonight, French President Macron has called for national unity, saying ""we will get through this together"". Earlier he announced that, from Saturday, a four-week night-time curfew will be in place in Paris and eight other cities. He will also seek parliamentary approval to extend this to six weeks. ""If, during these six weeks, we follow the curfew, we act collectively to reduce the number of contacts, thatâs the point at which we think we can progressively start to open again,"" said Mr Macron. ""Iâm being very careful here because experience has shown that we can cannot control everything,"" he added. ""We canât outline everything but six weeks seems to us to be the best duration for our actions."" French President Macron is being interviewed by two journalists on TV for these announcements this evening, and he's said that people can still meet outside of curfew hours. But he urged people to limit family gatherings to no more than six people. The president said exceptions could be made for those with over six people in their immediate families. Emmanuel Macron said that anyone violating the curfew being imposed in major cities in France would be fined 135 euros ($158.61). The nightly curfew will affect almost one third of the country's 67 million people. A new national lockdown is not expected, however. Mr Macron said of the curfew: ""We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 pm. We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."" President Macron says during France's curfew, people will not be allowed to visit friends. All theatres, restaurants and bars will need to close during curfew, he added. There will not be any travel restrictions between regions of France however and no restrictions on public transport. Work and schools are also to continue as normal. From Saturday, curfews will be in place in the French capital, Paris, and eight other cities including Grenoble, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse, President Emmanuel Macron announces. The restriction will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00 local time. And is to last for at least four weeks. It comes as France re-imposes a state of health emergency to contain the spread of coronavirus. French President Emmanuel Macron's imminent announcement comes as French authorities say the number of people being treated in hospital has risen above 9,100 for the first time since 25 June. The fear is the growing number of cases could overwhelm the country's hospital system. See more graphs here. France is re-imposing a state of health emergency to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government says. It comes shortly before President Emmanuel Macron is due to appear on national television at 19:00 GMT. He is expected to detail fresh coronavirus measures. The change will allow ""measures proportional to the health risks to be taken"", and will come into force on Saturday, according to minutes from a cabinet meeting and reported by AFP. The country, like many European nations, is grappling with rising case numbers in the pandemic's second wave. Macron will give interviews with two French journalists in his TV appearance, his office says. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said lockdowns may be introduced again if infection rates do not improve in hard-hit areas. Record numbers of cases of coronavirus are continuing to be announced around Europe today, as the continent grapples with a fresh wave of infections. Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic, has reported 7,332 new infections - its highest daily increase on record. Romania has also added a record 4,016 cases to its tally. And as we reported earlier, records have been broken today in Russia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile 11,970 new cases have been reported in Spain. While not a record, it comes as Spain continues to report the highest number of infections in Europe - currently over 908,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning. With almost every area of Northern Ireland now seeing ""hotspot"" levels of Covid transmission, the nation's political leaders have responded by announcing tighter restrictions, including closing all schools for two weeks from Monday (which does include the existing half-term break of course).Other new measures will last four weeks and includethe closure of bars and restaurants except for those offering takeaways, a ban on supermarkets and off-licences selling alcohol after 20:00, and the closure of hairdressers and beauty salons. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has announcedthat people from areas of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland with high rates of coronavirus will be banned from travelling into Wales from 18:00 BST on Friday if the prime minister does not bring in UK-wide travel restrictions. He told the Welsh Parliament he had asked for work on a ban to be brought forward after Boris Johnson failed to reply to two letters requesting he introduce such a measure. Some of the details are still to come, such as what counts as ""high"", what exceptions there will be and whether the same fines system currently in place for people transgressing movement restrictions inside Wales will be applied to unwelcome visitors. Meanwhile in England, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas been defending his approach to tackling the resurgent Covid threatwith a region-by-region system of restrictions. At Prime Minister's Questions, he was challenged byLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer to introduce a nationwide  ""circuit-breaker""- a short period of tough restrictions to bring the virus under control that thegovernment's own scientific advisers suggest could halve the number of coronavirus deathsbetween now and the end of the year. The PM said his ""logical"" three-tier strategy would ""suppress the virus where it is surging"" - but added that he ruled nothing out. Here's the Commons exchange between the two men: This video can not be played The prime minister and Labour leader clashed over coronavirus policy Just two hours before becoming the first English area to move into Tier 3 restrictions - meaning the closure of any pubs that cannot operate as a restaurant -footage widely circulated on social media showed crowds gathering in the city centre as bars emptied out.Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke said he was ""absolutely livid"" at scenes of revellers dancing and surrounding a police car, while Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said the pictures ""shame our city"". Boris Johnson said in the Commons the Liverpool measures are being implemented because its Covid transmission rate is currently 20 times higher than that in Cornwall.

"Boris Johnson faced questions from MPs as a new three-tier alert system has taken effect in England, with millions of people facing extra curbs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer again questioned why the UK PM did not opt for a limited national lockdown Wales will ban entry to people from coronavirus hotspots by Friday if there are no UK-wide restrictions, the first minister says Schools in Northern Ireland will close for two weeks and hospitality businesses face tighter restrictions France introduces a 'state of health emergency', coming into force at the weekend Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia has said bars and restaurants are to close for 15 days from Thursday Restrictions are tightening across the continent as cases rise - a partial lockdown comes in in the Netherlands at 2200 (2000 GMT) The World Bank said it will supply $12bn (Â£9.3bn) to help developing countries purchase and distribute vaccines, tests and treatment There are 38 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with 1.08 million deaths Claire Heald So, it is au revoir, goodbye, from our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, and do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Claire Heald, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Cheetham, Lauren Turner, Mal Siret and Sophie Williams. It's been another busy day of coronavirus developments, with the latest being the new measures in France. Here's what else has been happening both in the UK and across the world this Wednesday.   Almost an hour into his TV appearance tonight, French President Macron has called for national unity, saying ""we will get through this together"". Earlier he announced that, from Saturday, a four-week night-time curfew will be in place in Paris and eight other cities. He will also seek parliamentary approval to extend this to six weeks. ""If, during these six weeks, we follow the curfew, we act collectively to reduce the number of contacts, thatâs the point at which we think we can progressively start to open again,"" said Mr Macron. ""Iâm being very careful here because experience has shown that we can cannot control everything,"" he added. ""We canât outline everything but six weeks seems to us to be the best duration for our actions."" French President Macron is being interviewed by two journalists on TV for these announcements this evening, and he's said that people can still meet outside of curfew hours. But he urged people to limit family gatherings to no more than six people. The president said exceptions could be made for those with over six people in their immediate families. Emmanuel Macron said that anyone violating the curfew being imposed in major cities in France would be fined 135 euros ($158.61). The nightly curfew will affect almost one third of the country's 67 million people. A new national lockdown is not expected, however. Mr Macron said of the curfew: ""We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 pm. We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."" President Macron says during France's curfew, people will not be allowed to visit friends. All theatres, restaurants and bars will need to close during curfew, he added. There will not be any travel restrictions between regions of France however and no restrictions on public transport. Work and schools are also to continue as normal. From Saturday, curfews will be in place in the French capital, Paris, and eight other cities including Grenoble, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse, President Emmanuel Macron announces. The restriction will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00 local time. And is to last for at least four weeks. It comes as France re-imposes a state of health emergency to contain the spread of coronavirus. French President Emmanuel Macron's imminent announcement comes as French authorities say the number of people being treated in hospital has risen above 9,100 for the first time since 25 June. The fear is the growing number of cases could overwhelm the country's hospital system. See more graphs here. France is re-imposing a state of health emergency to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government says. It comes shortly before President Emmanuel Macron is due to appear on national television at 19:00 GMT. He is expected to detail fresh coronavirus measures. The change will allow ""measures proportional to the health risks to be taken"", and will come into force on Saturday, according to minutes from a cabinet meeting and reported by AFP. The country, like many European nations, is grappling with rising case numbers in the pandemic's second wave. Macron will give interviews with two French journalists in his TV appearance, his office says. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said lockdowns may be introduced again if infection rates do not improve in hard-hit areas. Record numbers of cases of coronavirus are continuing to be announced around Europe today, as the continent grapples with a fresh wave of infections. Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic, has reported 7,332 new infections - its highest daily increase on record. Romania has also added a record 4,016 cases to its tally. And as we reported earlier, records have been broken today in Russia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile 11,970 new cases have been reported in Spain. While not a record, it comes as Spain continues to report the highest number of infections in Europe - currently over 908,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran (L) and Prime Minister Jean Castex are reportedly under investigation French police have raided the homes of senior government and health officials as part of an investigation into their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran and the director of the national health agency, JÃ©rÃ´me Salomon, are among those whose properties were searched on Thursday. The raids came after a court launched an inquiry earlier this year into the government's handling of the pandemic. It has faced criticism over shortages of equipment and slow response times. Prime Minister Jean Castex is also under investigation, French media report, as is his predecessor Edouard Philippe and Mr VÃ©ran's predecessor AgnÃ¨s Buzyn. The prime minister and Mr VÃ©ran have been at the forefront of France's new policy of imposing night-time curfews in nine cities, including Paris, from Saturday, which will be enforced by 12,000 police. ""This means at 21:00 everyone must be at home and, without exception, every place, business or public service open to the public will be shut,"" Mr Castex said on Thursday. WHO: Europe restrictions 'absolutely necessary' How to tell which countries are coping best Tracking the global outbreak In July, the court launched the inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemicafter members of the public, including doctors and relatives of victims, alleged that it had been criminally negligent in its response to Covid-19. The special court hears cases of alleged wrongdoing by ministers and other government officials in the course of their duties. But for the claims to be substantiated, there would have to be evidence that officials knowingly failed to take obvious steps that would have saved lives. This video can not be played Emmanuel Macron said the curfew would last for four weeks but could be extended At a news conference on Thursday, Prime Minister Castex said he had ""absolute"" confidence in both Mr VÃ©ran and Mr Salomon. A further 22,951 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Wednesday. ""We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus,"" Mr Macron said in a television address. The president added that this wave of Covid-19 was different to the outbreak in the spring because the virus had spread to all parts of France. France managed to control the first outbreak by introducing a national lockdown. It then opened bars and restaurants in the summer, and allowed foreign tourists to visit as part of an effort to boost the ailing economy. Schools reopened and universities began teaching classes in person in early autumn. But since August the number of reported cases has accelerated quickly. Wednesday was the third time in six days that France reported more than 20,000 new infections. Mr Macron said the new measures aimed to reduce daily cases to around 3,000. As with the first wave of Covid-19, there is concern that hospitals and intensive care units will become overwhelmed with patients. The curfew, from 21:00 to 06:00, will apply for at least four weeks to Paris and its suburbs as well as Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Saint-Etienne, Rouen, Toulouse, Grenoble and Montpellier. Affecting around 22 million people, it will be applied for four weeks to begin with and Mr Macron's government will seek to extend it to six. President Macron said the virus has spread to all parts of France now The measures will stop people visiting restaurants and private homes during the evening and night-time. Private parties will be banned, even in areas not under curfew, from midnight on Friday. But there is some scepticism over how effective the curfew might be. ""People were mainly going out to eat out which they will continue to do... until 9pm,"" Lou Mielot, a student at the University of Lyon, told the BBC. ""This will create restaurants that are full from 7pm to 9pm, [where people] won't be able to keep a safe distance,"" she added. Residents will need a valid reason to be outside their homes during the hours of curfew. President Macron said on Wednesday night he understood a curfew was a ""hard"" thing to ask people to do. On Thursday, Mr Castex said travel during hours of curfew was permitted for trips to the hospital or pharmacy, or if work hours required. But a special certificate would need to be produced as proof. Pre-booked tickets for planes and trains that arrive after the curfew will be allowed. Anyone found breaking the curfew will be fined â¬135 (Â£121). Businesses that suffer financially due to the new measures will be eligible for state aid. Any company with up to 50 staff in the nine cities affected will be eligible for help if their turnover has fallen by over half in the past year. All companies in curfew areas will be asked to move towards having employees work from home for at least part of the week, and to stagger working hours. President Macron has already suggested ""tele-working"" for two or three days a week. ""We're in the second wave,"" the president said. For many people his address will have sounded distressingly similar to what he had to say at the start of wave one. Situation dire; hospitals under threat; public failing to get it; action. Of course there are huge differences. Today we know so much more. We wear masks and get tested. Doctors have better treatments. And another national lockdown - like the one in March - has been ruled out. But suddenly it feels like we are back where we began. Just as in March, we are warned of a virus that has become rampant and can only be stopped with drastic action.  Just as in March, we're told the health system risks being swamped. People will accept the curfew. What choice do they have? But it feels like the start of a long, miserable winter. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Zoe Powell, 29, died with Phoebe, eight, when their people carrier collided with a lorry in Oxfordshire. Their deaths on Monday night came just months after the family lost everything in a blaze at their home in Chinnor. Mrs Powell's son Simeon, six, and four-year old Amelia, died at John Radcliffe Hospital where their father, Josh, 30, and 18-month-old sister remain. Mr Powell and his daughter are in a serious condition but showing signs of improvement and ""expected to make a recovery"", Thames Valley Police said.

The crash happened on the A40, near a railway bridge between Oxford and Cassington, at 21:50 BST on Monday. Dr Barr, of St Andrew's Church, said the Powells were a ""delightful family"" and had attended the church's after-school sessions. ""They were just a lovely family, they really were.

Mrs Powell, who had lived in Chinnor since the mid-2010s but was previously from Sheffield, was a blogger who wrote about motherhood, family life and the challenges of having young children. She created a specialised diary called the Mama Book, which was written to help young mothers find ""mental space in the midst of motherhood"". Another of the Powells' neighbours talked of how ""incredibly sad"" she felt, especially after the house fire. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: ""It was a hard enough year for them regardless, and now this... it's just incredible. ""It's rather raw and it's horrendous.

"Liverpool won the Premier League for the first time last season Premier League clubs have ""unanimously agreed"" that 'Project Big Picture' will not be ""endorsed or pursued"". The controversial plans, proposed by Liverpool and Manchester United, were rejected at a meeting of the 20 clubs in England's top flight on Wednesday. Instead, the clubs agreed to ""work together"" on a new ""strategic plan"" for the ""financing of English football"". They also decided on a Â£50m rescue package for League One and Two clubs at the meeting. A Premier League statement said ""discussions will also continue with the EFL"" over financial support for the Championship. 'Breakaway league threatened by Project Big Picture organisers' Radical reforms could have 'damaging impact' 'Project Big Picture' involved reducing the Premier League from 20 to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup and Community Shield. In addition, the English Football League would have got 25% of all future TV deals, which would have been negotiated jointly, plus a Â£250m bail-out. However, it would also have seen more power transferred to the so-called 'big six' Premier League clubs. In its statement, the Premier League said its members had ""agreed to work together as a 20-club collective on a strategic plan for the future structures and financing of English football, consulting with all stakeholders to ensure a vibrant, competitive and sustainable football pyramid"". It added: ""Clubs will work collaboratively, in an open and transparent process, focusing on competition structure, calendar, governance and financial sustainability. ""This project has the full support of the FA and will include engagement with all relevant stakeholders including fans, government and, of course, the EFL."" The Premier League cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with the Championship, League One and League Two each retaining 24 teams. The bottom two teams in the Premier League relegated automatically with the 16th-placed team joining the Championship play-offs. The League Cup and Community Shield abolished. Parachute payments scrapped. A Â£250m rescue fund made immediately available to the EFL & 25% of all future TV deals. Â£100m paid to the FA to make up for lost revenue. Nine clubs given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, based on their long time in the Premier League. ""Clearly there's some frustration that a proposal that hadn't had the input from the clubs has been pushed so hard in public,"" said Premier League chief executive Richard Masters. ""We don't have any beef with the EFL. We have a historic relationship - we want that to be constructive. ""It was a candid, positive and - in the end - a unanimous meeting. ""We decided to move on from 'Big Picture' and move on to a new review process. ""Solidarity is incredibly strong so while there's been a lot said, I don't think it's irreparably damaged the Premier League."" FA chairman Greg Clarke had said a breakaway league was suggested ""as a threat"" by the organisers of 'Project Big Picture'. Masters added: ""I don't think anyone has been talking about breaking away. ""We acknowledge the English model is a huge success but it hasn't been reviewed for a long time, so maybe there are some systemic issues that haven't been dealt with."" The Premier League said the financial package for League One and Two clubs was intended to make sure they ""will not go out of business as a result of the financial impact of Covid-19 and be able to complete the 2020-21 season"". It conceded they were at more risk than Premier League and Championship clubs as they ""rely more heavily on matchday revenue and have fewer resources at their disposal"". ""This offer will consist of grants and interest-free loans totalling a further Â£50m on top of the Â£27.2m solidarity payments already advanced to League One and League Two this year, making a total of Â£77.2m,"" added the Premier League statement. The EFL will meet all its clubs on Thursday to discuss the Premier League's proposal and said it was ""encouraging that there is an acknowledgment that a review of the current status quo is required"". Its statement went on: ""The EFL welcomes the opportunity to contribute to any wider debate with colleagues across the game as we seek to finally address impossible economic pressures and deliver on the objective of having a sustainable EFL in the long term."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who described 'Project Big Picture' as 'Project Power Grab', has previously called on the Premier League to look after those lower down the football pyramid. ""This morning I reiterated calls of many in the football family for bigger clubs to look after smaller clubs,"" he said. ""An offer has been made by the Premier League to EFL League One and Two which is a good start. ""I urge them to work together and stay focused on helping clubs through this crisis."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone The wording of the Premier League statement is interesting. On the one hand, Project Big Picture is not being endorsed; on the other, all 20 clubs have agreed to work on a strategic plan ""in an open and transparent process, focusing on competition structure, calendar, governance and financial sustainability"". So, depending on how you look at it, the work of Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United counterpart Joel Glazer is either dead in the water or has opened discussion on something the EFL in particular has been calling for desperately. I was told the reaction to Liverpool and Manchester United in today's meeting was tame compared to what it might have been. However, there has been no apology and some clubs believe there is now a lack of trust between the 'big six' and the rest, which probably underlines why ""all 20 clubs"" and ""open and transparent"" were so high up in the Premier League's statement. We can never know whether there would have been this new commitment to reform had Project Big Picture not made its way into the public domain. Its authors are sceptical that there would have been and hence feel justified - nor do they view their ideas as being over. Evidently though, the suggestion that the voting mechanism within the Premier League could be changed so six clubs out of a 'special' nine would have to power to create, change or block any issue has no support and will have to be changed. The other interesting aspect of the past 72 hours surrounds EFL chairman Rick Parry. There were some EFL clubs who were not entirely happy with Parry before this news came out. Now they are solidly behind him. It is fair to say this enthusiasm is not shared by his Premier League counterparts. The relationship between the two leagues now will be fascinating.

"Twice as many men die from drug-related deaths, but cocaine deaths among women surged last year Drug-related deaths reached their highest level for a quarter of a century last year as the number of women who died after using cocaine surged. Figures showed 4,393 people died in England and Wales from drug poisoning. Cocaine deaths increased for the eighth year running, rising by 7.7% for men and 26.5% for women. The Office for National Statistics said the overall death rate for men was twice as high as for women, however. About two-thirds of all deaths from drug poisoning were due to drug misuse, the ONS said - meaning the underlying cause was drug abuse or addiction, or they involved illegal drugs. Overall, deaths rose only slightly from 4,359 registered in 2018 to 4,393 registered in 2019. But that figure is the highest since records began in 1993. Men accounted for 2,968 drug-related deaths - more than two out of three - while 1,425 were women. 'Surprise and disappointment' at UK drug response 'I'm using more coke and ecstasy in lockdown' Opiates such as heroin and morphine were involved in more than half of deaths where the drug type was known. The ONS said rates of drug poisoning have been on a ""steep upward trend"" since 2012 due to rises in heroin and cocaine deaths. In 2018, there were 637 registered deaths involving cocaine - including 117 women and 520 men. In 2019 there were 708 deaths - 148 women and 560 men. Taking age into account, the death rate for men declined slightly in 2019, while for women it increased for the tenth consecutive year. Prof Julia Sinclair, chairwoman of the addictions faculty of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said years of cuts had left services ill-equipped to prevent drug deaths. ""The tragic number of drug-related deaths should be all the evidence the government needs to substantially invest in addiction services, before more lives are needlessly lost,"" she said. Niamh Eastwood, director of drug policy charity Release, said two Parliamentary committees - the Health and Social Care Select Committee and the Scottish Affairs Select Committee - had called for reform of drug policy to tackle these deaths. The health committee recommended ""non-judgemental harm reduction"" policies andcalled for a consultation on decriminalising drug possession for personal use,external. She said the prime minister and home secretary should ""stop playing politics and listen to the evidence"". Death rates were highest in deprived areas, with people in their 40s living in the poorest neighbourhoods at least five-and-a-half times more likely to die from drugs than those in the least deprived, the ONS said. The north-east of England had the highest drug-related death rate, almost three times higher than the area with the lowest rate in 2019, the east of England. ""Investment in these communities, adequate housing, restoring benefits to a decent level, along with drug policy and harm reduction initiatives can save lives,"" Ms Eastwood said. The age at which most people died from drug use is increasing, the ONS said, from 20 to 29-year-olds from 1993 to 2002 to 40 to 49-year-olds today. It is ""possible"" that a generation born in the 1960s and 1970s, Generation X, has been dying in greater numbers from drug misuse over time, the ONS said. The figures include deaths from all drugs, including prescription and over-the-counter medications. They also include accidents and suicides involving drugs, as well as complications from injecting drugs such as deep vein thrombosis and blood poisoning. About half of the deaths registered last year will have occurred in previous years, statisticians believe, due to the time it can take for an inquest to be held.

"The European Union is about to formally reject a UK plea for special allowances for exports of electric cars in a post-Brexit trade deal. A draft addition to the deal says electric and hybrid cars will only get zero tariffs if a majority of the parts' value is from the two areas. The draft, seen by the BBC, means that even if there is a deal, some UK car exports to the EU will not be eligible. And this means tariffs of 10% will apply from January. The draft, was circulated among EU member states on Tuesday, says that Annex II of the agreement on ""Product Specific Rules of Origin"" will specify the ""maximum content of non-originating [that is non EU and UK] materials of 45% of the ex-works price of the vehicle"" for ""electrified vehicles"" from January 1st 2021. Last month, the UK circulated a proposal, also seen by the BBC, that in the case of electric and hybrid cars, only a minority of parts would at first need to be either from the UK or the EU - and up to 70% could come from elsewhere. This had been requested by key car export factories, dependent on electric batteries, hybrid systems, and other technology, mainly from Japan. Blow to UK car industry in hunt for EU trade deal Prof David Bailey, automotive specialist at the Birmingham Business School and UK in a Changing Europe, told the BBC: ""This will catch out some UK based car assemblers, particularly as the industry electrifies. ""The car industry is going through fundamental change, the EU see a threat from China, Korea and Japan, and is trying to build an electric vehicle supply chain in Europe."" Nissan, Toyota and Honda all have substantial manufacturing facilities in the UK, although Honda says it will close its Swindon factory next year with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. Alongside a separate but related request to treat Japanese parts as if they were British, which Lord Frost, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, told the car industry he ""obviously cannot insist upon"", the BBC understands that some in the car industry are planning for the introduction from January of tariffs on some of their vehicle exports to the EU, even with an agreed deal. These more relaxed arrangements had been requested by both the British and EU automotive sector in a letter last month. The draft annexe to the deal also goes even further from 2027, only allowing the use of car batteries manufactured either in the EU or the UK in tariff free vehicle trade between the two. Both sides are in a race to build ""gigafactories"" to service exploding demand for electric vehicles. The EU position would prevent the UK using a trade deal with the EU to become an offshore assembly hub for the export into the Single Market using mainly Asian or American parts, whilst guaranteeing long term tariff free access to the UK for EU manufacturers. ""A strong stable and predictable battery supply is of strategic importance for the long term competitiveness of the EU automotive sector,"" the draft annexe says. The terms of the proposal seeks to phase out reliance on non-European batteries. The European Commission and Number 10 have been approached for comment.

"This video can not be played Covid circuit breakers are doomed to fail, says disease expert Ministers are ""planning very seriously"" for a circuit breaker lockdown for Wales, the first minister has said. ""We're very actively talking about and preparing for that should it be necessary,"" Mark Drakeford told Sky News. The short-term measurescould include closing pubs and restaurants. However disease expert Dr Roland Salmon said such circuit breaker lockdowns were ""doomed to failure"" and would only bring ""cost without benefit"". Acircuit breakeris a short, set period of maybe two or three weeks, where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. The UK government's Scientific Advisory Committee (Sage) urged forthe introduction of circuit breaker restrictions three weeks ago. Mr Drakeford said: ""We want to act now in order to prevent the worst from happening, to give us a better chance of getting through the rest of the autumn and the winter, and if a circuit breaker is the right way to do it then that is what we will do. ""I'm not announcing it today but I do want people to know we are planning very seriously, so if we do need to do it we'll be in a position to do it and in a position to do it quickly."" Mr Drakeford has already called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene a Cobra meeting so that all four UK nations could discuss the measure. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said earlier on Wednesday a decision would be made in the next few days on the issue in Wales A circuit break would see tighter restrictions would be brought in for a short period Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a circuit breaker lockdown was needed to provide time to get the test and trace system ""in order"" and prevent the NHS from being ""overwhelmed"". He said there should also be a full reintroduction of the furlough scheme, financial help for businesses and support for people asked to self-isolate. ""Unless we take action, our NHS could be overwhelmed and unable to contend with a second wave which may well be worse than the first."" When asked about a circuit breaker on Wednesday morning, Mr Gething told BBC Breakfast the school half term - staring on 26 October - was a ""potential way to introduce a break"" if it was decided to do so. However Dr Salmon, former director of communicable diseases at Public Health Wales, said it will not suppress the virus. He said any short-term measures - lasting between two and three weeks - would not be long enough to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from households where people are infectious but do not show symptoms. ""I simply don't think a circuit breaker will work,"" he said. ""It won't work because even Sage (UK government Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies) in its consideration thought it would only delay matters, not suppress the virus altogether."" What can I do during local lockdowns? Social distancing needed 'until vaccine found' 'Rolling lockdowns' will become the norm in Wales Whatever period was chosen for a circuit breaker, infectious people would still be released back into the community, he said. The retired epidemiologist, who led the response to the E-coli outbreak in south Wales in 2005, believes governments should ""rethink the whole model"" and focus more on shielding the most vulnerable sections of the community, rather than placing restrictions on those considered to be at lower risk. ""We should be shielding older people, shielding at-risk occupations and for track and trace the priority should be on those places we know the virus is transmitted, like hospitals, care homes, meat factories, prisons or even universities,"" he said. ""We need a rational approach that's so far been lacking."" His view was echoed by Prof Dale Andrew Fisher, who specialises in infectious diseases at the National University Hospital, Singapore, and is part of the World Health Organisation's outbreak alert and response network. He said circuit breakers were a short-term fix and were not ""sustainable"". ""It has to be just to buy time or to recover, but really this virus is going to be with us for a lot longer yet,"" he told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast ""We don't expect to be vaccinating most of the world until 2022 so we have to learn to live with this virus and we have to be able to go to school, go to work, do our normal activities in a Covid-safe way, limiting the impact of social and economic needs."" He added: ""You shouldn't need to do this if you can ramp up contact tracing, get all your contacts in quarantine, isolating all the positive cases. ""It needs to be part of a strategy, not 'lets do a circuit breaker, numbers are down, let's open up again'."" It is not clear if a circuit breaker would see schools close in Wales, as ishappening in Northern Ireland from Monday. Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said any circuit break should be Wales-wide and not down to individual local authorities as confusion causes ""more harm than good"". She said: ""The concern for schools is always going to be what about the vulnerable pupils."" She said a circuit breaker would be ""another issue"" for parents but added: ""On the flipside, this option would be a much needed break for teaching staff at this time.""

"Banks have told expat customers to close their accounts within months Banks must ensure closing expats' UK bank accounts does not leave customers in ""undue financial hardship"". Thousands of expats living in the EU have been told their bank accounts will be closed owing to Brexit. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stressed to banks that they must give at least two months' notice of plans to close any accounts in credit. It said some were not informing customers in good time, but only certain banks plan to shut accounts. Following the UK's full departure from the EU, UK banks will no longer be allowed to provide services to customers in the EU without the right banking licences. This is known as passporting, a system for banks in the EU which allows them to trade freely in any other state in the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for more authorisation. Some, but not all, banks have decided it is not in their commercial interests to jump through these hoops and continue accounts for expats. Sharon, who lives in The Netherlands, was shocked to receive a letter saying her current account will be closed unless she can provide a UK address The effect on individuals was revealed byBBC Radio 4's Money Box last month. It heard from people like Sharon Clarke, a Briton who has been living in the Netherlands for 20 years and who had banked with Lloyds for decades without any financial problems. ""I was shocked to receive a notification saying that my bank account is going to be closed in two months,"" she told the programme. ""They said that unless I provide a UK address, my account will be closed and I'll have to cut up my card."" She said she was given until early November to close her account and transfer all monies, standing orders and regular payments to another bank. The issue was taken up by Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee. In response to Mr Stride's questions, the new FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said banks were being reminded of their responsibilities. ""This includes identifying whether closing accounts would cause any particular customers or classes of customer undue financial hardship, taking into account the availability of alternative products,"" he said. Mr Stride described this as a ""welcome move"" and said his committee would continue to monitor the situation closely. However, there seems little chance of many, if any, of these banks reversing their decision to close accounts - leaving many expats needing to switch current account providers.

Reality Check Defending his policy of regional restrictions, Prime Minister
Boris Johnson said: âthe disease is appearing much more strongly in some parts
of the country than in othersâ. He gave the
example of Liverpool where he said âthe figures are now running at 670 cases
per 100,000 against 33 cases per 100,000 in Cornwallâ. Heâs roughly
right here. The latest case data from Cornwall records 31 cases per 100,000 in
the week to 10 October. Liverpool
recorded 635 cases per 100,000 over the same period and the Merseyside area of
Knowsley, which is now under the âvery highâ tier of restrictions, recorded 667
cases per 100,000, closer to the number the Prime Minister cited. Read more

minister was asked how people prevented from working by Covid
restrictions would make ends meet. He said: âwhatever
happens, a combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit will mean
that nobody gets less than 93% of their current income.â Chancellor Rishi
Sunak gave an example on Monday of a worker in their late twenties, renting
privately and working 35 hours a week. Let's call him 'Jack'... The chancellor said that if
that if Jack's employer was forced to close by restrictions, Jack would receive
just over 90% of his previous income after taxes and benefits, even though
the Job Support Scheme would only be getting him two thirds of his wages. How much he would actually receive would depend on a number of factors including how much
he earns and the rent he pay. It is possible to
come up with a scenario in which Jack would receive about 90% of his usual income because he would not pay as much tax and could be entitled to
Universal Credit. But the Institute
for Fiscal Studies points out that if you took a worker making Â£12 an hour
rather than the Â£8.72 minimum wage then their earnings would probably still be
too high to qualify for Universal Credit even if their wages were cut by one
third, so although they would pay less tax, they would still have to live on
only about 70% of their previous income. We canât find the
evidence for the PMâs 93% claim though and have contacted the Treasury.  We'll let you know if they come back to us In the meantime you can read more on thishere. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent In truth there was more heat than light at todayâs PMQs as
the protagonists traded charges of opportunism. But in the High Noon political duel, it felt that Keir Starmer had come better armed. The advice from the scientists on Sagegave Sir Keir his initial ammo. But he reloaded â by citing support for a âcircuit breakâ
from a Conservative as well as Labour local government leaders. And, in effect, he accused the prime minister of costing lives
by not âfollowing the science. Boris Johnson shot back, accusing Sir Keir of
u-turning on his previous position of supporting the governmentâs measures. And failing to get his MPs to vote for restrictions which
the Labour leader apparently backed. But the Prime Minister was forced to defend a regional
approach with no guarantee this will be enough to drive the reproductive rate  - the so calledâ Râ number - of the virus below 1. If the PM succeeds, then his own MPs in areas  of lower
restrictions, and many voters, will raise a glass to celebrate that businesses
have remained open. But if the virus is resistant to the current measures, Sir Keir's attack that the PM is too slow to act could really hit home. And withNorthern Irelandand Scotland already imposing
tougher restrictions, the Labour leader is taking an opportunity to portray the
Prime Minister as an outrider. Reality Check Prime Minister
Boris Johnson called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to âwork together as he was
prepared to do on Monday to keep kids in school, who he would now yank out of
school in a peremptory wayâ. Mr Johnson may
have misunderstood the Labour leaderâs proposed circuit breaker plan. The proposal was
to implement it around half term when schools would be closed anyway, and to
keep them open for the rest of the time. Announcing his support for the strategy yesterday, Sir Keir said the plan would ""not mean schools closing"" but it should
""run across half-term to minimise disruption"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament And after 34 minutes, this week's Prime Minister's Questions comes to an end.  House of CommonsParliament The Liberal Democrat's Wendy Chamberlain says she has used her contact tracing app to check-in today but will need to manually switch to the Scottish app when she travels home to Fife. She says this is a particular problem in border communities and asks the prime minister what he is doing to solve it. Boris Johnson say he is grateful to her for pointing out the issue and says he will ""do what I can to introduce interoperability"" across the nations. He adds that in terms of overall approach, the four nations have much in common. House of CommonsParliament Joining via video link DUP's Gregory Campbell raises the latest measures brought in by the Northern Ireland Executive,including shutting bars and schools. He asks what plans Mr Johnson has ""to help these much needed sectors"" that are in ""dire need"" of support. The PM says he is in ""continuous contact"" with Stormont and ""will look at further imaginative and creative measures"" to support businesses across the UK. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Helen Hayes tells the prime minister about her constituent who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He wants to move closer to his family but because of the cladding on his building he cannot sell it until his building gets an EW1S certificate which could take ten years. ""Luke cannot wait that long,"" she says and asks ""when will the prime minister end this scandal."" Conservative MP Matthew Offord also asked Boris Johnson about this issue earlier. Mr Johnson says the government is looking at ways of ensuring mortgage backing for those in this difficult situation. He adds that ""we must get on with removing flammable cladding of all kinds."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Matt Western asks the prime minister abouta story that broke over the weekendregarding his Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick. His Newark constituency had been granted Â£25m of funding from the department by another minister. But Mr Jenrick approved funding ""to return the favour"" to that minister, he claimed. . Mr Western says it ""looks a bit grubby"". But Boris Johnson says it was ""independently approved"", adding: ""If he has some serious allegation to make.. may I suggest he has the guts to make it?"" House of CommonsParliament SDLP MP Colum Eastwood says that under the new furlough scheme, a full-time worker on minimum wage would earn Â£227 a week. ""I doubt this PM could survive on that,"" he says. He goes on to ask Boris Johnson how he expects others to live on the wage? The PM replies that a ""combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit means nobody gets less than 93% of their income"". House of CommonsParliament Next up is the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford. He quotes the founder of Scottish firm Brewdog, who warns the end of furlough will ""lead to tsunami of unemployment"". And he accuses the PM of being ""reckless"". Mr Johnson says the chancellor has offered new measures and Universal Credit has been increased. But Mr Blackford says the answer ""just shows the prime minister doesn't get it"". He says the prime minister's next job ""could be on the backbenches"" and that he will ""never, not ever be forgiven for the damage he is about to cause to the people"". Mr Johnson responds by saying the government is ""continuing to support people across whole of the UK"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer uses his last question to ask about a quote from government sources that there is an 80% chance of the prime minister backing a circuit break. ""Is that right,"" asks Sir Keir. ""And if it is, why doesn't he do it now - save lives, fix testing and save the NHS."" Boris Johnson hits back accusing Sir Keir of supporting the government one day and then performing ""a dramatic U-turn the next"". He adds Labour want to exploit the crisis. In answer to the Labour leader's question the PM says ""I rule out nothing in combating the virus."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Coronavirus testing The reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19 is now officially averaging above one across the UK once again - although it varies by region. But what exactly does it mean and how is it calculated? Read our explainer from our Health and Science correspondent here Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The difficulty for the PM is that he has to defend a
regional approach, but knows he cannot rule out further national action further down the line. He portrays the Labour leader as the man who wants to shut
pubs and bars but he too has done so in the worst-hit areas, and itâs pretty clear that
more areas will join the Liverpool City region in the top tier. House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir says he has listened to the prime minister and his strategy ""but I can't think of a single scientist who backs him"". He quotes England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said on Monday he was ""not confident nor is anybody confident"" the highest tier restrictions will be enough to tackle the rise in positive cases. The Labour leader asks: ""Why is the prime minister so confident his approach will get the R number below one? Or is that no longer the government's plan?"" Mr Johnson accuses him of ""misrepresenting the position"" of the government. He says if the regional measures are implemented ""in full with support and active cooperation"" of local leaders, along with ""full and proper enforcement"" and strong local testing, ""those measures would deliver the reduction in the R that we need in order to avert what none of us want to see - except the right honourable gentleman - of a nation lockdown"". The PM adds: ""We don't want to go there. We want a regional approach. He should cooperate."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster announces the new restrictions in Northern Ireland Schools will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday evening, in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. The moves are amongnew restrictions being imposed,externalby the executive. It comes as NI's Department of Health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Hospitality businesses will be limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday. Health officials had warned infections would rise further if both schools and hospitality premises remained open. Northern Ireland's health department has now recorded 23,115 cases since the pandemic began - a quarter of which have been reported in the past week. The executive has agreed schools will close for two weeks, including the half-term holiday, until Monday 2 November, when their closure will be reviewed. Education Minister Peter Weir vowed to oppose any move to extend school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. He said lengthening the Halloween mid-term break by a further week of holiday represented a ""compromise"" position within the Stormont Executive. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure but they were ""content"" with the decision. NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external Coronavirus Q&A: What has changed in NI? 'I think we're done' - Restaurant and bar owners react Sports hit by tighter measures Mrs Foster outlined the changes in a statement to assembly members. Further guidance is being issued that will also advise against unnecessary travel, and the executive will meet on Thursday to discuss further support packages for businesses concerned about what closures will mean for jobs and viability. Talks ran into the early hours of Wednesday as ministers tried to reach a compromise on a range of decisions, finally agreeing to impose the following measures for four weeks from Friday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households,other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.Â Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services -  prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting While there was no specific mention of hotels, it is understood they will also be closing for four weeks. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she was ""urgently engaging with executive colleagues to clarify the specifics of these new restrictions, and the potential impact on hotels, before they come into effect"". There is also likely to be more guidance on the likes of soft play areas, cinemas and swimming pools. There are new restrictions coming into place for weddings, civil ceremonies and funerals, which will be limited to 25 people from Monday with no receptions permitted. Face coverings will not be obligatory for such ceremonies in places of worship. Ministers have agreed no additional restrictions will be placed on shops, but there will be ""urgent engagement"" with the sector about extra measures to prevent further spread of the virus. Driving lessons will be allowed to continue. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds The current restrictions on household mixing are expected to remain as they are. That would mean no mixing of households in private homes - with exceptions including those joined in social bubbles - and gatherings in gardens limited to six people from no more than two households. Mrs Foster said the executive hoped the measures would reduce virus transmission rates, while reinforcing public health messaging. ""A lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention,"" she told the assembly. She also told the assembly there had been 485 coronavirus-related incidents schools - many involving a single case - and fewer than 10 schools required support for more than two cases. ""There are other issues around school gates and transport and issues like that but we are going to work with the education department about how we can minimise risks,"" she added. White smoke emerged shortly after 00:30 - the tradition of late Stormont nights making a return once more. Ministers had reconvened at 23:00 after tensions erupted earlier, with the SDLP and Alliance complaining they had been given too little time to scrutinise the proposals. One source said when the meeting first got under way, the atmosphere was ""horrendous"", but when ministers returned for the second time it's understood tempers had calmed and the midnight meeting was a more sombre affair. The nature of decision-making at Stormont sees five parties sharing power in a mandatory coalition - and their views have differed greatly at times during the pandemic. It appears the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in reached a compromise over the timing of school closures - for now - and whether to apply hospitality measures throughout Northern Ireland. Advice from health officials was that NI-wide restrictions had to be imposed by Friday. The executive seems to have listened to that recommendation, but some are asking why the parties laboured so long over the proposed plan, given the urgency of the situation. But these are seismic decisions: every step back into what resembles the original lockdown has ramifications. Ministers will also be facing questions about why they appear to have chosen to diverge from some of the health officials' original advice. Readmore from Jayne. The executive has also agreed to advise universities and further education colleges to run courses online. Queen's University Belfast has confirmed teaching will be carried out online for the rest of the semester, unless face-to-face work is considered ""essential or unavoidable."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who is self-isolating after a relative tested positive for coronavirus, said there would be no changes to childcare arrangements. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said the executive had given ""painstaking consideration"" to next steps. ""We will do everything we possibly can to make sure there are protections in place for businesses, workers and families,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The prime minister and Labour leader clashed over coronavirus policy A new three-tier system of regional Covid-19 restrictions in England ""is the right way forward"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM told the House of Commons the policy ""can bring down the virus"" but that he did not rule out going further. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer again called for a ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, limited lockdown in England to bring the virus under control. He said such a move was supported by government science advisers. The PM said he hoped the three-tier system would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". He added: ""I rule out nothing of course in combating the virus, but we are going to do it with the local, the regional approach that can drive down and will drive down the virus, if it is properly implemented."" It comes as Wales prepares to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirusfrom travelling to the countryfrom 18:00 BST on Friday. On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Five unanswered questions about the new system Laura Kuenssberg: Can Johnson hold out against more restrictions? The new tier system has begun in England, with the Liverpool region the first to enter the highest alert level. The BBC understands that a meeting of the Joint Biosecsurity Centre (JBC) has suggested that Greater Manchester alongside much of north-west and north-east England, large parts of Yorkshire and parts of the Midlands should also be moved into the highest tier. The JBC recommendations will not necessarily be enforced and discussions are likely to continue between local and national politicians and officials over the coming days. Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham had a meeting with deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and said further talks are to take place on Thursday morning with the ""PM's team"". Most of the country is in the lowest tier - medium - but millions of people in the North and the Midlands are currently in the second highest tier and face extra curbs on households mixing. Schools, close-contact services and all retail outlets will remain open under basic measures, even in the highest alert areas. In other developments: Schools in Northern Ireland will close from Monday and pubs and restaurantsface new restrictions on Friday Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of Englandas she singled out Blackpool as ""associated with a large and growing number of Covid cases in Scotland"". Passengers arriving in the UK from at-risk countries might be able to avoid having to quarantine as part of a number of options being considered by the government. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told a travel conference the plan could involve private Covid testing or a period of self-isolation before departure Local politicians in Greater Manchester have argued against the region being put into the highest tier saying that without increased financial support they would prefer a circuit-breaker. Mr Burnham said he would consider a legal challenge if the government placed the area in Tier 3 restrictions, adding such a move would be ""by imposition, not consent"". But Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said he was not in support of a circuit-breaker at this time. Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he and Mr Burnham were also considering legal action against the newjob support scheme. He said it appeared ""discriminatory"" that No 10 had offered to pay 80% of workers' pay in March under the furlough scheme while the latest help is providing two-thirds of wages to employees of businesses made to close under the restrictions. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         By political correspondent Leila Nathoo The approach of targeting different restrictions at different parts of England has exposed a rift between Westminster and some local politicians, who have called for more say over what's happening in their areas. Under pressure to say why he has so far rejected the idea of a national ""circuit-break"" period, Boris Johnson was keen to stress that the current package of measures could bring down transmission IF there was co-operation at a local level and proper enforcement. More involvement for local leaders means more responsibility for things going well - or badly. For now, the PM seems determined to continue to try to tread this middle path - mindful also perhaps of the chunk of his own MPs concerned about even the current range of restrictions and the impact on the economy. The risk is that he may have lost valuable time, if he does decide to change course. The Labour leader'sinitial call for a circuit-breaker in Englandcame on Tuesday. Sir Keir said such a course of action would help buy time to ""save lives, fix testing, and save the NHS"". Schools would kept open as normal because it would be timed to coincide with the October half term. However, Sir Keir said ""all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed"" and compensated. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said Mr Johnson had rejected the advice of government science advisers, whohad suggested a circuit-breaker when they met on 21 September. Separately, a scientific report has suggested a two-week circuit-breaker at the end of this monthmay halve coronavirus deaths between now and the end of the year. The researchers said the measure ""buys more time to put other controls in place"", but there is huge uncertainty over some of their predictions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? RULES:What can and can't you do where you live? But, responding to Sir Keir's comments, the PM told MPs the three-tier system was an ""opportunity to keep things going, to keep our kids in schools, to keep our businesses going"" and the ""logical thing to do"". ""That, I think, is what the people of this country want to do. This is our opportunity to do that and suppress the virus where it is surging,"" he said. The PM said the disease was now ""appearing much more strongly"" in some parts of the country than others so a different approach was needed to that taken earlier in the year. He highlighted the fact there were 670 coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents in the Liverpool region, compared with 33 per 100,000 in Cornwall.

"Pub, restaurant and hotel owners have told BBC News NI they fear it is ""crunch time"" for their businesses as Northern Irelandprepares to face new coronavirus restrictions. The NI Executive has announced that delivery and takeaway-only services will be allowed from food establishments from Friday, with shorter periods for selling alcohol at off-licences and supermarkets. Hotels could be set to close their doors for four weeks from 18:00 BST on Friday, in line with pubs and restaurants. That news has yet to be confirmed, but the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation has said it expects the move to go ahead. Gerard Keenan, owner of Dan's Bar in west Belfast ""To be honest I think we're done,"" Dan's Bar owner Gerard Keenan told BBC News NI. ""In a couple of weeks or so if it hasn't changed I think we've no choice, we'll have to sell our bar, I don't really want to do this anymore."" Mr Keenan said his business had been praised by Belfast City Council and police who had inspected safety measures introduced since pubs were allowed to reopen. ""I thought we were doing an excellent job in our pub,"" he said, adding that the latest measures have ""cut the feet from beneath us"". Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster ""This is now endgame for many in the hospitality industry,"" Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster told BBC News NI. ""We understand that obviously health comes first, but I think it's fair to say the hospitality industry has done more than any other industry to step up with measures. ""We have a health crisis, we accept that, but we also now have a hospitality crisis,"" he continued. ""What happens in four weeks if the rate [of infection] hasn't come down?"" Selina Horshi, managing director of White Horse Hotel in Campsie County Londonderry hotel owner Selina Horshi said her business had to borrow to pay bills ""month on month"" during the initial lockdown and fears the latest measures will hit the industry hard. With the Derry and Strabane District Council area facing tighter measures in recent weeks, including on travel advice, she said occupancy levels are down and her business misses out on many of the financial support packages. ""We really need to know exactly what the rules are because we're always having to do things incredibly quickly,"" she told Good Morning Ulster. ""We need communication about exactly which parts of the sector are going to be helped and which ones aren't. ""This is crunch time."" Colin Johnston, Galgorm Collection Managing Director The managing director of the Galgorm Collection said he was ""devastated"" by Wednesday's announcement. ""Last week we publicly called on the Executive to protect the industry and the livelihoods of its workforce and we are incredibly saddened that this has fallen on deaf ears,"" Colin Johnston said. ""Last week we warned that up to 75% of hospitality jobs and people's livelihoods could be lost by Christmas unless measures are put in place by the executive to sustain the industry. ""We have not seen any detailed evidence to support the case that the hospitality sector is a driver of community transmission."" Kelvin Collins, owner of Ben Madigan's Bar & Kitchen in Belfast North Belfast pub owner Kelvin Collins said it is ""crunch time number two"" for his business. ""It's a hard time for everybody,"" he explained, adding that he voluntarily closed before the first lockdown ""because we were worried about customers"". Mr Collins said he had ""no choice but to try"" survive the latest measures having put ""blood, sweat and tears"" into building up the business. ""We're coming into Christmas, it's normally a time of year where we build reserves for January, February and March of next year, there are a lot of businesses that are closing down now that might not reopen again."" Joanne Shilliday, owner of Hole in the Wall bar in Armagh Joanne Shilliday said people need to ""understand the reality"" of what the restrictions will do to businesses like her own. ""I do not know how we will survive,"" the Hole in the Wall bar owner told PA. She explained that there will be a wider impact: ""It is not just us, it is the taxi drivers, it is the old people that live on their own, that have no one else but us, it is out staff. ""It is mind-blowing this morning."" Michael Deane, restaurant owner and chef Belfast restaurant owner Michael Deane said his sector is ""being treated like criminals"" and becoming a ""scapegoat for everybody else"". ""We haven't seen the data that it was spreading in restaurants,"" he explained, adding that ""consumer confidence is already on the floor"". However, the businessman said he believes ""a full lockdown is needed"" to change behaviours and argued measures should not be ""half-hearted"". ""Children are going to meet on the street corners, students are still going to go to off-licences up to eight o'clock, then they are going to order carry-outs from local restaurants,"" he continued. Michael Henderson, director of the Northern Ireland Takeaway Association The NI Takeaway Association said many takeaway food businesses will find it very difficult if there is a reduction of passing trade from the restrictions on local hospitality businesses. The association's director, Michael Henderson, said existing takeaways will also find it difficult to compete ""as the market becomes more saturated with restaurants who are forced to pivot in these uncertain times"" towards offering such services. ""We believe financial packages will be put in place and we hope these will be suffice to support the industry,"" he added.

"As Northern Ireland heads into winter, a so-called circuit breaker is being considered to slow the spread of Covid-19 As coronavirus cases continue to rise again in NI, the possibility of imposing a so-called ""circuit breaker"" has been gaining traction. Stormont ministers have insisted it won't be a return to full lockdown like we experienced in March, so what would it look like? BBC News NI explains why it is being considered, the impacts it could have and when it might take effect. It is a short, sharp period of tightened restrictions for everyone to curb the spread of coronavirus, usually lasting about two weeks. It gained traction in London last month, with Number 10 proposing it as one way of trying to halt the rapid growth in infections. Other countries such asNew ZealandandSingaporehave previously deployed the strategy. The number of Covid-19 cases in Northern Irelandhas jumped dramaticallyin recent weeks. Although hospital admissions and numbers of patients in intensive care remain low, health officials remain concerned that the situation could spiral out of control into the winter season, unless more drastic measures are taken soon. The Department of Health has saidthere could be 1,000 new coronavirus cases every dayin Northern Ireland in a month's time, if the current trend continues. Covid-19 numbers in Northern Ireland have jumped dramatically in recent weeks The rate of new deaths following a positive test for Covid-19 has also begun to rise and the R number - or rate of transmission of the virus - is currently estimated at about 1.5. That's why the idea of a circuit breaker remains on the table, with NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young saying it is ""one of the more powerful interventionsin terms of reducing the transmission of the virus"". It needs to be long enough to break the chains of transmission - but short enough to minimise the effect on the economy. Its length would be pre-determined and likely to last a maximum of two or three weeks. Health Minister Robin Swann has said there would be a ""timeliness"" to introduce the measure around the half-term Halloween holidays, but warned that if cases continued rising sharply, it may need to be brought in sooner. The executive has said that keeping schools open remains its top priority, with First Minister Arlene Foster sayingthere would not be a return to a situation where schools close again, like they did in March. The executive has said that keeping schools open is a priority If, as anticipated, the executive implements the move in the run-up to Halloween, there could be an extended break for schools, as opposed to the one-week half term they normally get at this time of year. BBC News NI understands there are ongoing discussions within the Department of Education about the break lasting as long as three weeks. If that was the case, schools could be asked to stay open for children of key workers, but most pupils would be taught remotely for two of those weeks. Practically, it could mean an end to going to the pub or to restaurants for the duration of the circuit breaker. The hospitality industry in NI is already required to close at 23:00, but additionallocal restrictions currently apply in Derry City and Strabane council area, where pubs, hotel bars and restaurants can only offer takeaway, delivery, and outdoor dining. Executive ministers have already said those measures may have to be extended across other parts of Northern Ireland soon. A circuit breaker could also mean stricter guidance on people working from home, and advice against travel out of your local area. It is not clear if some close contact services - such as hair and beauty salons - would be advised to close, and whether the executive would issue further advice on weddings, funerals and church services. The exact impact on jobs is also uncertain,given the furlough scheme is due to end on 31 October, which could coincide with a circuit breaker. Economy Minister Diane Dodds has argued strongly that further measures to curb the spread of the virus will have a negative impact on businesses. She has called for an economic analysis to be carried out on the measure before the executive agrees to introduce it. Economy Minister Diane Dodds has called for an analysis to be carried out before the executive agrees to further measures Her officials have warned that Northern Ireland ""cannot afford another lockdown"", and that there could bemore than 100,000 unemployment claimants in Northern Ireland by the end of this year. Other executive ministers have also been pressing Westminster for commitments of additional money, in the event that tighter Covid restrictions are brought in. In reality, the executive will have to balance its health plans to tackle the virus with its reliance on the British government for extra financial support. On Friday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said employees who work for UK firms forced to shut by law because of coronavirus restrictions will get two-thirds of their wages paid for by the government. He said this was an ""expansion"" of the Job Support Scheme, which begins on 1 November and will be available for six months. As a result, Northern Ireland and the other devolved nations will automatically get a rise in funding through what's known as a Barnett consequential. Stormont ministers will be keeping a keen eye on Westminster for an anticipated restrictions update on Monday, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas. The executive is also conscious of the land border shared with the Republic of Ireland, and there have been calls for an all-island approach to any further measures. On Tuesday, the Irish governmentrejected advice from its public health officialsto move the whole country to the tightest level of restrictions, arguing that the proposals went too far. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has put in place additional restrictions for the country's hospitality sector, althoughshe said this did not mean a return to ""full lockdown"". There is growing speculation that a circuit breaker for Northern Ireland could be announced soon. Last Sunday, Dr Gerry Waldron of the Public Health Agency said it was ""almost inevitable"", while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said if Northern Ireland was moving towards that, then ""people should be informed that's where we are going"" through clear communication. Any recommendations from Stormont's Department of Health will need to be approved by the whole executive, where opinions among the five parties have varied greatly during the pandemic. It is also possible that if the strategy is implemented and works, then it could be deployed again, if deemed appropriate by the executive.

"Boris Johnson faced questions from MPs as a new three-tier alert system has taken effect in England, with millions of people facing extra curbs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer again questioned why the UK PM did not opt for a limited national lockdown Wales will ban entry to people from coronavirus hotspots by Friday if there are no UK-wide restrictions, the first minister says Schools in Northern Ireland will close for two weeks and hospitality businesses face tighter restrictions France introduces a 'state of health emergency', coming into force at the weekend Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia has said bars and restaurants are to close for 15 days from Thursday Restrictions are tightening across the continent as cases rise - a partial lockdown comes in in the Netherlands at 2200 (2000 GMT) The World Bank said it will supply $12bn (Â£9.3bn) to help developing countries purchase and distribute vaccines, tests and treatment There are 38 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with 1.08 million deaths Claire Heald So, it is au revoir, goodbye, from our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, and do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Claire Heald, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Cheetham, Lauren Turner, Mal Siret and Sophie Williams. It's been another busy day of coronavirus developments, with the latest being the new measures in France. Here's what else has been happening both in the UK and across the world this Wednesday.   Almost an hour into his TV appearance tonight, French President Macron has called for national unity, saying ""we will get through this together"". Earlier he announced that, from Saturday, a four-week night-time curfew will be in place in Paris and eight other cities. He will also seek parliamentary approval to extend this to six weeks. ""If, during these six weeks, we follow the curfew, we act collectively to reduce the number of contacts, thatâs the point at which we think we can progressively start to open again,"" said Mr Macron. ""Iâm being very careful here because experience has shown that we can cannot control everything,"" he added. ""We canât outline everything but six weeks seems to us to be the best duration for our actions."" French President Macron is being interviewed by two journalists on TV for these announcements this evening, and he's said that people can still meet outside of curfew hours. But he urged people to limit family gatherings to no more than six people. The president said exceptions could be made for those with over six people in their immediate families. Emmanuel Macron said that anyone violating the curfew being imposed in major cities in France would be fined 135 euros ($158.61). The nightly curfew will affect almost one third of the country's 67 million people. A new national lockdown is not expected, however. Mr Macron said of the curfew: ""We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 pm. We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."" President Macron says during France's curfew, people will not be allowed to visit friends. All theatres, restaurants and bars will need to close during curfew, he added. There will not be any travel restrictions between regions of France however and no restrictions on public transport. Work and schools are also to continue as normal. From Saturday, curfews will be in place in the French capital, Paris, and eight other cities including Grenoble, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse, President Emmanuel Macron announces. The restriction will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00 local time. And is to last for at least four weeks. It comes as France re-imposes a state of health emergency to contain the spread of coronavirus. French President Emmanuel Macron's imminent announcement comes as French authorities say the number of people being treated in hospital has risen above 9,100 for the first time since 25 June. The fear is the growing number of cases could overwhelm the country's hospital system. See more graphs here. France is re-imposing a state of health emergency to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government says. It comes shortly before President Emmanuel Macron is due to appear on national television at 19:00 GMT. He is expected to detail fresh coronavirus measures. The change will allow ""measures proportional to the health risks to be taken"", and will come into force on Saturday, according to minutes from a cabinet meeting and reported by AFP. The country, like many European nations, is grappling with rising case numbers in the pandemic's second wave. Macron will give interviews with two French journalists in his TV appearance, his office says. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said lockdowns may be introduced again if infection rates do not improve in hard-hit areas. Record numbers of cases of coronavirus are continuing to be announced around Europe today, as the continent grapples with a fresh wave of infections. Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic, has reported 7,332 new infections - its highest daily increase on record. Romania has also added a record 4,016 cases to its tally. And as we reported earlier, records have been broken today in Russia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile 11,970 new cases have been reported in Spain. While not a record, it comes as Spain continues to report the highest number of infections in Europe - currently over 908,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""Idiots"" gather in Liverpool on eve of new Covid rules Pictures of large crowds gathering in Liverpool two hours before new Covid-19 restrictions came into effect ""shame our city"", its mayor has said. Footage on social media showed people dancing and surrounding a police car in Concert Square at 22:00 BST. Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of the government's new system of restrictions. Mayor Joe Anderson said ignoring facts about the virus was ""why we are in Tier 3 measures"". The new rules mean pubs in the city regionnot serving meals must stay shut, along with gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos. The crowds gathered as nearby bars closed but police said they were dispersed quickly and safely, although 38 fixed penalty notices were issued for breaching coronavirus legislation. Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of the government's new system of coronavirus restrictions Liverpool has the third highest infection rate in England Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke said he was ""absolutely livid"" when he saw the scenes and described those involved as ""selfish, dangerous and childish"". He said the ""vast majority"" of people were abiding by the rules but those who were ""blatantly disregarding the law"" were putting extra pressure on the force. Liverpool currently has the third highest rate of infections in England with 635 cases per 100,000 of population up until 10 October, behind Nottingham which has 880 and Knowsley with 667.5. Paul Brant, cabinet member for adult health and social care, said intensive care beds in the city were at more than 90% capacity and were soon expected to reach or exceed the levels of occupancy seen during the first wave. He added: ""At the current rate of increase, we would expect Liverpool to surpass the peak of the first wave probably within the next seven to 10 days."" Mr Anderson, reacting to footage circulating of the crowds on social media, tweeted: ""These pictures shame our city."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He added: ""Our health service is creaking, 300 in hospital & 30 people dead in [a] week. Ignoring these facts is why we are in Tier 3 measures."" Mr Anderson, who previously called for a circuit-breaker lockdown, questioned whether the measures would be enough to tackle the ""uncontrollable"" spread of the virus and called for unity. ""This city is in a Covid crisis. It's an enemy we are really finding it hard to get on top of and defeat,"" he said. ""We need to keep working together and pulling together."" City councillor Nick Small said those involved were ""idiots putting themselves, their friends, families and everyone else at risk, destroying jobs and our hospitality sector while they do it"". Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said hospitals in the city faced a ""dire situation"". He appeared in a video message issued by the city council and urged the public to ""please pay great attention to the regulations that are being brought in"". Prof Semple said: ""We have got over 300 patients in beds and our intensive care capacity is currently running at 90%. ""At this rate we are looking at exceeding healthcare capacity in the next week or so."" In the top tier of the new restrictions pubs not serving meals must stay shut Richard Kemp, leader of the city's Liberal Democrat group, warned against scapegoating Liverpool's young people for something involving ""at most 300"" people. ""What they did was wrong and they should be ashamed of their behaviour,"" he said. ""However, we have 60,000 students in our city and a very large number of our resident population under 25. ""This means that 99.99% of the city's young people behaved themselves last night and should be congratulated for their restraint."" Liverpool musician Ian McNabb took to social media to support youngsters ""partying loud and hard on the last night before the shutdown"". ""If I was 18 I'd be right there with them,"" the former frontman of the Icicle Works posted on his Facebook page. Ch Supt Peter Costello, of Merseyside Police, said: ""While we understand the new rules are frustrating for some, we would continue to advise everyone to abide by them - including keeping social distancing - for the safety of everyone."" Meanwhile, a number ofgyms in Merseyside are defying the orderto close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical well-being."" Gym owner Mick Povall says if gyms do not get to open soon he might never reopen One gym owner who has closed his business said it was a ""huge blow not just for myself but for the people in the local community who come here"". Mick Povall, owner of Gravity Health and Fitness in Upton, Wirral, said: ""The government carries on about the importance of improving mental health and avoiding obesity during the pandemic and then in the same breath shuts down one of the best tools to achieve those goals. ""If we don't reopen soon, we might never reopen."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"In Liverpool, revellers took to the city centre the night before new restrictions came into force The new three-tier system of Covid-19 restrictions has begun in England. Most of the country is in the lowest tier - medium - but millions of people in the North and the Midlands face extra curbs on households mixing. The Liverpool region is the only area to be under the toughest rules, with pubs and bars not serving meals closed. Government health officials are due to meet later to discuss the possibility of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and some other areas joining the top tier. Hours before the top tier rules came into force in Liverpool, police were forced todisperse large crowds in the city. Meanwhile,Northern Ireland has announced an extension of the half-term holidays for schools, from Monday, alongside other new measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. And in Wales ashort circuit breaker lockdown is being ""actively considered""by the Welsh Government. How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Five unanswered questions about the new system Laura Kuenssberg: Can Johnson hold out against more restrictions? The Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham,tweeted,externalthat he had not spoken with the government about the new restrictions since Friday, claiming pressure was being ""piled on via media briefings"". Astatement,externalfrom Mr Burnham, his deputy and leaders of all 10 councils in the area, said the current evidence around infection rates and hospital admissions did not support the area going into Tier 3 (the top tier). The financial package accompanying Tier 3 restrictions was ""nowhere near sufficient to prevent severe hardship, widespread job losses and business failure"", the statement added. It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmercalled for a two to three-week ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown in Englandto bring the infection rate under control. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Areas onmedium alertare subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos will also close. Covid Sage docs: What was the evidence and what happened? What is a circuit break? Prime Minister Boris Johnsondefended the systemat Prime Minister's Questions, saying the regional approach aimed to ""seize this moment now to avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the measures did not go far enough - a view he said was echoed by the government's scientific advisers. And MPs in Liverpoolsaid the city ""risks being dragged back to the 1980s""without proper financial support alongside the new restrictions. Parliament has approved the legislation to write a new three-tier system into law,but 42 Tory MPs rebelled in a vote to express their disapproval of the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants in England. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Meanwhile, the Scottish governmentis to implement its own three-tier framework of restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. In Northern Ireland, hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday, alongside a raft of new restrictions. The country's First Minister, Arlene Foster, said the decisions had not been taken lightly, adding: ""I don't shy away from the fact that a lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention."" And in Wales, the Welsh Government is considering bringing in deeper lockdown measures over a short period of time, including closing pubs and restaurants during the school half-term holiday. The government sees its three-tier system of localised restrictions as striking a balance between fighting the virus and protecting the economy. However, Sir Keir Starmer's decision to back a much tougher England-wide temporary lockdown does mean there is now an alternative plan on the table. And it is a plan thatcame recommended by the government's own scientists. Downing Street has not ruled out a ""circuit break"" completely - to do so, it maintains, would be irresponsible. But it has been very clear that it does not want to get there. A senior government source accused Labour of playing politics but the move will increase the pressure on Mr Johnson to show that his alternative works - and does so quickly. He is likely to have the backing of his own MPs - many of whom are not keen to go further for now at least. The former minister Andrew Mitchell - who has voiced criticism in recent days - said the three tier system must be given time to show results. Outlining his call for a ""circuit breaker"" at a press conference on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir said current measures to curb the spread of coronavirus were not working. He proposed that schools would remain open, with the circuit breaker taking place across half-term to ""minimise disruption"". However he said it would mean all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed and compensated. Non-essential retail businesses would also shut. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? His comments came afterdocuments revealed,externalgovernment scientific advisers called for such action three weeks ago. On Tuesday, a further 17,234 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 143 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.

that nobody gets less than 93% of their current income.â Chancellor Rishi
Sunak gave an example on Monday of a worker in their late twenties, renting
privately and working 35 hours a week. Let's call him 'Jack'... The chancellor said that if
that if Jack's employer was forced to close by restrictions, Jack would receive
just over 90% of his previous income after taxes and benefits, even though
the Job Support Scheme would only be getting him two thirds of his wages. How much he would actually receive would depend on a number of factors including how much
he earns and the rent he pay. It is possible to
come up with a scenario in which Jack would receive about 90% of his usual income because he would not pay as much tax and could be entitled to
Universal Credit. But the Institute
for Fiscal Studies points out that if you took a worker making Â£12 an hour
rather than the Â£8.72 minimum wage then their earnings would probably still be
too high to qualify for Universal Credit even if their wages were cut by one
third, so although they would pay less tax, they would still have to live on
only about 70% of their previous income. We canât find the
evidence for the PMâs 93% claim though and have contacted the Treasury.  We'll let you know if they come back to us In the meantime you can read more on thishere. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent In truth there was more heat than light at todayâs PMQs as
the protagonists traded charges of opportunism. But in the High Noon political duel, it felt that Keir Starmer had come better armed. The advice from the scientists on Sagegave Sir Keir his initial ammo. But he reloaded â by citing support for a âcircuit breakâ
from a Conservative as well as Labour local government leaders. And, in effect, he accused the prime minister of costing lives
by not âfollowing the science. Boris Johnson shot back, accusing Sir Keir of
u-turning on his previous position of supporting the governmentâs measures. And failing to get his MPs to vote for restrictions which
the Labour leader apparently backed. But the Prime Minister was forced to defend a regional
approach with no guarantee this will be enough to drive the reproductive rate  - the so calledâ Râ number - of the virus below 1. If the PM succeeds, then his own MPs in areas  of lower
restrictions, and many voters, will raise a glass to celebrate that businesses
have remained open. But if the virus is resistant to the current measures, Sir Keir's attack that the PM is too slow to act could really hit home. And withNorthern Irelandand Scotland already imposing
tougher restrictions, the Labour leader is taking an opportunity to portray the
Prime Minister as an outrider. Reality Check Prime Minister
Boris Johnson called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to âwork together as he was
prepared to do on Monday to keep kids in school, who he would now yank out of
school in a peremptory wayâ. Mr Johnson may
have misunderstood the Labour leaderâs proposed circuit breaker plan. The proposal was
to implement it around half term when schools would be closed anyway, and to
keep them open for the rest of the time. Announcing his support for the strategy yesterday, Sir Keir said the plan would ""not mean schools closing"" but it should
""run across half-term to minimise disruption"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament And after 34 minutes, this week's Prime Minister's Questions comes to an end.  House of CommonsParliament The Liberal Democrat's Wendy Chamberlain says she has used her contact tracing app to check-in today but will need to manually switch to the Scottish app when she travels home to Fife. She says this is a particular problem in border communities and asks the prime minister what he is doing to solve it. Boris Johnson say he is grateful to her for pointing out the issue and says he will ""do what I can to introduce interoperability"" across the nations. He adds that in terms of overall approach, the four nations have much in common. House of CommonsParliament Joining via video link DUP's Gregory Campbell raises the latest measures brought in by the Northern Ireland Executive,including shutting bars and schools. He asks what plans Mr Johnson has ""to help these much needed sectors"" that are in ""dire need"" of support. The PM says he is in ""continuous contact"" with Stormont and ""will look at further imaginative and creative measures"" to support businesses across the UK. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Helen Hayes tells the prime minister about her constituent who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He wants to move closer to his family but because of the cladding on his building he cannot sell it until his building gets an EW1S certificate which could take ten years. ""Luke cannot wait that long,"" she says and asks ""when will the prime minister end this scandal."" Conservative MP Matthew Offord also asked Boris Johnson about this issue earlier. Mr Johnson says the government is looking at ways of ensuring mortgage backing for those in this difficult situation. He adds that ""we must get on with removing flammable cladding of all kinds."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Matt Western asks the prime minister abouta story that broke over the weekendregarding his Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick. His Newark constituency had been granted Â£25m of funding from the department by another minister. But Mr Jenrick approved funding ""to return the favour"" to that minister, he claimed. . Mr Western says it ""looks a bit grubby"". But Boris Johnson says it was ""independently approved"", adding: ""If he has some serious allegation to make.. may I suggest he has the guts to make it?"" House of CommonsParliament SDLP MP Colum Eastwood says that under the new furlough scheme, a full-time worker on minimum wage would earn Â£227 a week. ""I doubt this PM could survive on that,"" he says. He goes on to ask Boris Johnson how he expects others to live on the wage? The PM replies that a ""combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit means nobody gets less than 93% of their income"". House of CommonsParliament Next up is the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford. He quotes the founder of Scottish firm Brewdog, who warns the end of furlough will ""lead to tsunami of unemployment"". And he accuses the PM of being ""reckless"". Mr Johnson says the chancellor has offered new measures and Universal Credit has been increased. But Mr Blackford says the answer ""just shows the prime minister doesn't get it"". He says the prime minister's next job ""could be on the backbenches"" and that he will ""never, not ever be forgiven for the damage he is about to cause to the people"". Mr Johnson responds by saying the government is ""continuing to support people across whole of the UK"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer uses his last question to ask about a quote from government sources that there is an 80% chance of the prime minister backing a circuit break. ""Is that right,"" asks Sir Keir. ""And if it is, why doesn't he do it now - save lives, fix testing and save the NHS."" Boris Johnson hits back accusing Sir Keir of supporting the government one day and then performing ""a dramatic U-turn the next"". He adds Labour want to exploit the crisis. In answer to the Labour leader's question the PM says ""I rule out nothing in combating the virus."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Coronavirus testing The reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19 is now officially averaging above one across the UK once again - although it varies by region. But what exactly does it mean and how is it calculated? Read our explainer from our Health and Science correspondent here Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The difficulty for the PM is that he has to defend a
regional approach, but knows he cannot rule out further national action further down the line. He portrays the Labour leader as the man who wants to shut
pubs and bars but he too has done so in the worst-hit areas, and itâs pretty clear that
more areas will join the Liverpool City region in the top tier. House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir says he has listened to the prime minister and his strategy ""but I can't think of a single scientist who backs him"". He quotes England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said on Monday he was ""not confident nor is anybody confident"" the highest tier restrictions will be enough to tackle the rise in positive cases. The Labour leader asks: ""Why is the prime minister so confident his approach will get the R number below one? Or is that no longer the government's plan?"" Mr Johnson accuses him of ""misrepresenting the position"" of the government. He says if the regional measures are implemented ""in full with support and active cooperation"" of local leaders, along with ""full and proper enforcement"" and strong local testing, ""those measures would deliver the reduction in the R that we need in order to avert what none of us want to see - except the right honourable gentleman - of a nation lockdown"". The PM adds: ""We don't want to go there. We want a regional approach. He should cooperate."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"In Liverpool, revellers took to the city centre the night before new restrictions came into force The new three-tier system of Covid-19 restrictions has begun in England. Most of the country is in the lowest tier - medium - but millions of people in the North and the Midlands face extra curbs on households mixing. The Liverpool region is the only area to be under the toughest rules, with pubs and bars not serving meals closed. Government health officials are due to meet later to discuss the possibility of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and some other areas joining the top tier. Hours before the top tier rules came into force in Liverpool, police were forced todisperse large crowds in the city. Meanwhile,Northern Ireland has announced an extension of the half-term holidays for schools, from Monday, alongside other new measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. And in Wales ashort circuit breaker lockdown is being ""actively considered""by the Welsh Government. How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Five unanswered questions about the new system Laura Kuenssberg: Can Johnson hold out against more restrictions? The Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham,tweeted,externalthat he had not spoken with the government about the new restrictions since Friday, claiming pressure was being ""piled on via media briefings"". Astatement,externalfrom Mr Burnham, his deputy and leaders of all 10 councils in the area, said the current evidence around infection rates and hospital admissions did not support the area going into Tier 3 (the top tier). The financial package accompanying Tier 3 restrictions was ""nowhere near sufficient to prevent severe hardship, widespread job losses and business failure"", the statement added. It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmercalled for a two to three-week ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown in Englandto bring the infection rate under control. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Areas onmedium alertare subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos will also close. Covid Sage docs: What was the evidence and what happened? What is a circuit break? Prime Minister Boris Johnsondefended the systemat Prime Minister's Questions, saying the regional approach aimed to ""seize this moment now to avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the measures did not go far enough - a view he said was echoed by the government's scientific advisers. And MPs in Liverpoolsaid the city ""risks being dragged back to the 1980s""without proper financial support alongside the new restrictions. Parliament has approved the legislation to write a new three-tier system into law,but 42 Tory MPs rebelled in a vote to express their disapproval of the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants in England. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Meanwhile, the Scottish governmentis to implement its own three-tier framework of restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. In Northern Ireland, hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday, alongside a raft of new restrictions. The country's First Minister, Arlene Foster, said the decisions had not been taken lightly, adding: ""I don't shy away from the fact that a lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention."" And in Wales, the Welsh Government is considering bringing in deeper lockdown measures over a short period of time, including closing pubs and restaurants during the school half-term holiday. The government sees its three-tier system of localised restrictions as striking a balance between fighting the virus and protecting the economy. However, Sir Keir Starmer's decision to back a much tougher England-wide temporary lockdown does mean there is now an alternative plan on the table. And it is a plan thatcame recommended by the government's own scientists. Downing Street has not ruled out a ""circuit break"" completely - to do so, it maintains, would be irresponsible. But it has been very clear that it does not want to get there. A senior government source accused Labour of playing politics but the move will increase the pressure on Mr Johnson to show that his alternative works - and does so quickly. He is likely to have the backing of his own MPs - many of whom are not keen to go further for now at least. The former minister Andrew Mitchell - who has voiced criticism in recent days - said the three tier system must be given time to show results. Outlining his call for a ""circuit breaker"" at a press conference on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir said current measures to curb the spread of coronavirus were not working. He proposed that schools would remain open, with the circuit breaker taking place across half-term to ""minimise disruption"". However he said it would mean all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed and compensated. Non-essential retail businesses would also shut. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? His comments came afterdocuments revealed,externalgovernment scientific advisers called for such action three weeks ago. On Tuesday, a further 17,234 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 143 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.

Updates were brought to you by Claire Heald, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Cheetham, Lauren Turner, Mal Siret and Sophie Williams. It's been another busy day of coronavirus developments, with the latest being the new measures in France. Here's what else has been happening both in the UK and across the world this Wednesday.   Almost an hour into his TV appearance tonight, French President Macron has called for national unity, saying ""we will get through this together"". Earlier he announced that, from Saturday, a four-week night-time curfew will be in place in Paris and eight other cities. He will also seek parliamentary approval to extend this to six weeks. ""If, during these six weeks, we follow the curfew, we act collectively to reduce the number of contacts, thatâs the point at which we think we can progressively start to open again,"" said Mr Macron. ""Iâm being very careful here because experience has shown that we can cannot control everything,"" he added. ""We canât outline everything but six weeks seems to us to be the best duration for our actions."" French President Macron is being interviewed by two journalists on TV for these announcements this evening, and he's said that people can still meet outside of curfew hours. But he urged people to limit family gatherings to no more than six people. The president said exceptions could be made for those with over six people in their immediate families. Emmanuel Macron said that anyone violating the curfew being imposed in major cities in France would be fined 135 euros ($158.61). The nightly curfew will affect almost one third of the country's 67 million people. A new national lockdown is not expected, however. Mr Macron said of the curfew: ""We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 pm. We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."" President Macron says during France's curfew, people will not be allowed to visit friends. All theatres, restaurants and bars will need to close during curfew, he added. There will not be any travel restrictions between regions of France however and no restrictions on public transport. Work and schools are also to continue as normal. From Saturday, curfews will be in place in the French capital, Paris, and eight other cities including Grenoble, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse, President Emmanuel Macron announces. The restriction will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00 local time. And is to last for at least four weeks. It comes as France re-imposes a state of health emergency to contain the spread of coronavirus. French President Emmanuel Macron's imminent announcement comes as French authorities say the number of people being treated in hospital has risen above 9,100 for the first time since 25 June. The fear is the growing number of cases could overwhelm the country's hospital system. See more graphs here. France is re-imposing a state of health emergency to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government says. It comes shortly before President Emmanuel Macron is due to appear on national television at 19:00 GMT. He is expected to detail fresh coronavirus measures. The change will allow ""measures proportional to the health risks to be taken"", and will come into force on Saturday, according to minutes from a cabinet meeting and reported by AFP. The country, like many European nations, is grappling with rising case numbers in the pandemic's second wave. Macron will give interviews with two French journalists in his TV appearance, his office says. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said lockdowns may be introduced again if infection rates do not improve in hard-hit areas. Record numbers of cases of coronavirus are continuing to be announced around Europe today, as the continent grapples with a fresh wave of infections. Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic, has reported 7,332 new infections - its highest daily increase on record. Romania has also added a record 4,016 cases to its tally. And as we reported earlier, records have been broken today in Russia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile 11,970 new cases have been reported in Spain. While not a record, it comes as Spain continues to report the highest number of infections in Europe - currently over 908,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lyricist and journalist Herbert Kretzmer, best known for his English-language adaptation of the musical Les MisÃ©rables, has died at the age of 95. The South African-born English writer also penned the lyrics to the 1960 song Goodness Gracious Me, made famous by Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. And he worked with French singer Charles Aznavour on his 1974 hit She. Paying tribute online, fellow lyricist Sir Tim Rice described him as ""a giant of his trade"", adding: ""RIP Herbie.""

Les MisÃ©rables producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the news was ""terribly sad"", and ""his wonderful words for Les Miserables will live on in his memory forever more"". In his day job as a journalist, Kretzmer became senior drama critic at the Daily Express, and later wrote television criticism for the Daily Mail. But he stressed ina 2013 interview with The Guardian,externalthat it was his role in coming up with the English lyrics to Les MisÃ©rables that would go on to define his career and life. ""I returned to the Mail, but then it became clear that the show had a fairly certain future: I was able to give up my day job at 61,"" he said. ""Les MisÃ©rables has brought me my London house and my wife, whom I met at the opening-night party in New York. I often marvel at how those few feet between [producer] Cameron Mackintosh's sofa and his door changed my life."" Kretzmer (left) working with Charles Aznavour in 1965 In the same interview, he explained that his role in coming up with famous songs, which included Do You Hear the People Sing and I Dreamed a Dream, was as much about re-imagining them as it was translating them from the French original. ""The word 'translation' makes me shiver,"" he explained. ""Words can resonate in one culture but not another, so I read the novel and then told the story in my own way."" In a joint statement, the musical's original French songwriters, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel SchÃ¶nberg, described their counterpart as ""a vibrant, hard-working man, but above all a man with an exceptional moral force as well as a brilliant lyricist"". They wrote: ""Thanks to him, Les MisÃ©rables found its English voice - Herbie embraced our original version and turned it into a work that speaks to the rest of the world. Kretzmer also wrote the 1960s West End shows Our Man Crichton, starring Millicent Martin; and The Four Musketeers, starring Harry Secombe. His long-running songwriting collaboration with Aznavour included Yesterday When I Was Young and She, which reached number one in the UK.

"The Duchess of Sussex has said she avoids saying anything too ""controversial"" for fear of putting her family ""in a position of risk"". Speaking at a virtual summit, Meghan said she instead chose to talk about ""fairly straight forward"" topics ""like exercising your right to vote"". But she said she would not feel proud as a mother if she had not tried to ""make this world better"" for her son. The duke and duchessrecently urged US voters to ""reject hate speech"". The Duke of Sussex made the remarks in a television broadcast alongside his wife last month - their first joint TV appearance since theyceased being working members of the Royal Family earlier this year. The couple also urged US citizens to vote in the country's upcoming presidential election. A spokesperson for the Sussexes said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead ""a call for decency"". Harry and Meghan call to end 'structural racism' George Floyd's life mattered - Duchess of Sussex Appearing at Fortune's members-only Most Powerful Women Next Gen Summit on Tuesday, Meghan was asked whether motherhood had made her more courageous or more cautious. Speaking from her home in California, she replied: ""It's interesting because my gut is that it makes you more courageous. ""It makes you so concerned for the world they're going to inherit, and so the things that you're able to tolerate on your own are not the same. ""You go every single day: 'How can I make this better for him? How can I make this world better for Archie?' And that is a shared belief between my husband and I. ""At the same time, I am cautious of putting my family in a position of risk by certain things, and so I try to be rather very clear with what I say and to not make it controversial, but instead to talk about things that seem fairly straight forward - like exercising your right to vote."" She added: ""As a parent I can enjoy all the fun and silliness and games with my son, but I wouldn't be able to feel proud of myself as a mom if I didn't know that I wasn't doing my part to make it a better place for him."" Meghan's son Archie was born in May last year Asked about her views on social media she compared it to an ""addiction"" for some, which could be ""unhealthy"", adding that she does not have any online accounts for her ""own self-preservation"". The duchess closed her personal Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts four months before she married the Duke of Sussex, while her lifestyle blog thetig.com shut down in 2017. Since stepping back as a working member of the Royal Family in March, Meghan has spoken out on issues including racism and the death of African-American George Floyd in the US. The couple gave up their roles as senior royals in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family.

"First Minister Arlene Foster delivered a statement to the assembly on increased coronavirus restrictions The Human Rights and Equality Commission briefed the Committee for the Executive Office on Brexit Executive Office officials answered questions on the UK Command Paper Tori Watson and Robin Sheeran Thanks for joining us today, particularly if you were here for the first minister's statement this morning. We'll be back at 09:30 tomorrow for a meeting of the Health Committee with a session on Covid testing and tracing. In the afternoon, the Public Accounts Committee continues its inquiry into Special Educational Needs provision. Pat Sheehan of Sinn FÃ©in asks about the Specialist Committee, which met on 9 October. âIs there any report of that committee yet?â he asks. Lynsey Moore says there are no formal reports of the meetings as they are held confidentially. There was a short statement sent after the meeting outlining the main points from the discussion, which she says she can send to the committee if they have not yet seen it. Has there been any feedback as to the atmosphere at those meetings, asks Mr Sheehan. Ms Moore says there is a willingness on both sides. That concludes the brief. Mr McGrath than directs members through a number of other items of business before closing the session. If you're a bit confused about the new Covid-19 regulations outlined by Arlene Foster in the chamber earlier this morning, check out the video below, orclick here. Allow Twitter content?

Committee chair Colin McGrath passes the question baton to Sinn FÃ©inâs Martina Anderson (below). She asks about the âunfettered accessâ referred to in the command paper. âAre you working in the Executive office in Brussels as opposed to here, are you still there in Brussels, is that  the case?â Lynsey Moore says she splits her time between Brussels and NI. âWeâre very active with our European counterparts on all of the issues,â she says. âIt is well understood that from 1 January the protocol comes into force,â says Ms Moore. Lorraine Lynas responds to queries Ms Anderson had about unfettered access. âThere was a lot of engagementâ with businesses through the NI engagement forum, she says. âThere is a difference of opinion between the different sectors, and even within sectors,â says Ms Lynas relating to âqualifying goodsâ. Colin McGrath of the SDLP asks about the âkey languageâ in the command paper, which he describes as âquite woolyâ. âLanguage like genuine, substantial, discretion, best endeavoursâ he says âI donât think itâs of best use for businesses hereâ. Lorraine Lynas says the âcommand paper now dates back to Mayâ adding that it was âsomewhatâ overtaken by the guidance to businesses in August. âBest endeavours is agreed language in the protocol,â says Lynsey Moore. TEO official Tom Reid joins the meeting on a rather crackly phone line. He explains that the command paper was issued on 20 May ""and sets out the UK's approach to implementing the Protocol in what it sees as a flexible and proportionate manner, which aims to protect the interests of both the whole of the United Kingdom and the European Union"". He says the intention is that processes should be ""streamlined"" to ensure there is as little disruption to NI life and business as possible. There are four key commitments: He says the paper was limited in technical detail and clarity was required in a number of areas ""particularly in order to enable businesses to plan for the end of the transition period"". Mr McGrath thanks the witnesses and there is a brief adjournment to prepare for the next session. The chair then greets the witnesses for the briefing on Brexit and the UK Command Paper. The panel are all officials at the Executive Office: â¢ Mrs Lorraine Lynas, TEOâ¢ Mr Tom Reid, TEOâ¢ Ms Lynsey Moore, TEO Emma Sheerin of Sinn FÃ©in joins the meeting by video link. She explains that she has had some technical problems this afternoon. She asks about the amendments to the Internal Market Bill relating to state aid. âCan you advise how you're going to challenge that, in terms of the non diminution?â Mr Allamby says the dedicated mechanism won't be up and running until January. âPart of our role will be determined on whether there is an agreement between the UK government and the EU 27,â he says. âWeâre doing the best that we can to scope out what the issues will be covered by the dedicated mechanism.â Committee chair Colin McGrath refers to the British government and says, ""if they're in a glass house they shouldn't throw stones and, somehow or other, it's our glasshouse that they're in"". Mr Allamby says ""we want to see the UK government to be in the vanguard and in upholding the rule of law on human rights and equality"". Pat Sheehan of Sinn FÃ©in asks Mr Allamby if the NIHRC would expect to have any input into the review of the Human Rights Act. The commissioner says the believes that the NIHRC and its equivalents in Scotland and England and Wales ""would all be very actively involved in any kind of conversation or consultation on the document"". DUP MLA Christopher Stalford is up next. He talks about âstatutory maternity payâ for women, which he says in the UK is 39 weeks, while in France it is 16 weeks. âCitizens of the UK have a full array of rights that are recognised in a much more fulsome way than other European countries,â he says. âI think itâs important that is put on record, and that narrative that we are in some way a rights backwater as a country, is just not borne out as peopleâs experience of living in this country.â The South Belfast MLA asks the panel âdomestic law, outranks international law, is that correct?â âThere are a number of things where the UK is ahead of EU law,â he says, but other aspects which have been âdriven by the EU and the UK then ran with some of those and in some cases exceeded thatâ. He then explains why âbreach of international law is a problemâ. âPart of our role is about the international standards as well as the national standards,â says the commissioner. Mr Stalford says âthe crux of the argument coming from the human rights commission seems to be that a measure that is designed to be about trade posts in Larne, poses a significant threat to the human rights standard to the people of NI?â Mr Allamby responds, âthe bill is not aimed at the dedicated mechanism, its target is not the Belfast /Good Friday Agreement, but we are saying that it could be collateral damage in how that would play out and we would prefer that wouldn't happenâ. Doug Beattie of the UUP joins the meeting by video link. He asks Mr Allamby to clarify the commissionâs stance on the Internal Market Bill. Mr Allamby says the commission looked at the bill and took some legal advice, which led it to concluding that âthere are hypothetical situationsâ around âindirect discriminationâ in the internal market which could ârub up against some of the equality provisions that may develop in EU lawâ. He raises concerns about the UK keeping up with developments in EU law. Mr Beattie says âIâm really concerned at the tone of the statementâ that is being released today. âThe tone is not meant to be unduly adversarial,â says Mr Allamby. âI recognise we are looking at potential impacts, we donât know what the impacts will be, we donât even know if parts of the Internal market Bill will be introduced,â he adds. âThe level of uncertainty is not helpful,â says the commissioner. Martina Anderson of Sinn FÃ©in she asks the witnesses if, in their joint statement, they will be asking the British government to clarify that there will be no breaches of the Good Friday Agreement as a result of the Internal Market Bill. Mr Allamby says the committee thinks ""they should make it clear beyond any doubt that provisions in the bill will not have any negative consequences for the work of the dedicated mechanism and the non-diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity under the Good Friday Agreement"". Ms Anderson says the international community believes that the British government is behaving like ""a rogue state"". Colin McGrath, the committee chair, breaks the 15:00 embargo on a report due to be published by the Human Rights Commissioner. He reads that part of the statement relating to the Internal Market Bill: âIt breaks the law, but by doing so, considerable uncertainty has been introduced regarding the future of human rights and equality commitments contained within the withdrawal treatyâ. Mr McGrath asks what uncertainties the panel has. Les Allamby replies by outlining a number of amendments to the Internal Market Bill relating to human rights. âIf you take that golden thread back from saying, youâre now, on the Internal Market Bill, not able to use certain Human Right Act's challenges, you can still say that the legislation for example is incompatible but it still leaves it to parliament to decide,â says Mr Allamby. âThat starts to unpick parts of the Human Rights Act in those terms,â he adds. The NI Human Rights Commissioner says âyou have to look at this in a kind of holistic wayâ. He says itâs important that the work of the dedicated mechanism is not âhampered by other developments around human rights and equalityâ. SDLP MLA Colin McGrath begins questions for the panel. He asks them to outline the kinds of rights that âcould be impactedâ due to Brexit. Mr Allamby says âeverything from cross-border health care cooperationâ to crossing the border for social activity, âis not underpinned by any lawâ but is âunderpinned by a kind of memorandum of understandingâ. He says âone of the issues for us is the need to have a proper legal underpinningâ to ensure the common travel area doesnât become âa political footballâ. The NI Human Rights Commissioner says âthere is significant cross-border cooperationâ between the PSNI and Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, adding that if there wasn't a clear agreement on issues such as the European Arrest Warrant, the âkind of institutional arrangements for extraditionâ and sharing of information âwould be in jeopardyâ. Les Allamby says the joint committee's remit extends beyond the dedicated mechanism, to ensure that âhuman rights and equality provisions under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement will be protected in to future as the UK left the EUâ. He turns to the Internal Market Bill, and reads the introduction of the white paper which was received earlier this year. He says it was âsomewhat of a surprise that the open admission less than eight weeks later, that the bill itself breaks international law in a very specific and limited wayâ. He adds that this was looked at on two fronts, including the international front and the âpractical consequences closer to homeâ. Mr Allamby explains that the two commissions have drawn the conclusion that the bill as currently envisaged with amendments, âundermines the Good Friday Agreementâs commitment to the EU Convention on Human Rightsâ. âIâm not convinced that other parts of the bill, beyond the breaking of international law, may not have some adverse consequences on the protection of human rights and equality,â says Mr Allamby. Mr McGrath explains that the commissioners are members of a joint committee and they are here to brief MLAs on the committee's role as a forum for the consideration of human rights on the island of Ireland. SinÃ©ad Gibney, begins the joint briefing. She says the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has a longstanding relationship with both the NI Human Rights Commission and the NI Equality Commission. She says the Belfast Agreement laid the groundwork for the two bodies, north and south. ""The agreement also established to joint committee of the two human rights commissions to foster collaboration and co-operation,"" she explains. Ms Gibney says that in recent years the committee has seen an increasing focus on the implications of the UK's withdrawal form the EU. She says that both commissions agreed that this presented ""significant risks for rights protection and for the effective functioning of the 1998 Agreement"". Colin McGrath is the committee chairperson The committee is opened to the public by the chair, Colin McGrath. Theyâve been sitting in private session since 14:00 for a Brexit briefing by the Northern Ireland Assembly EU Affairs Manager, Shauna Mageean. After running through some committee business, members get stuck into their next briefing session. Theyâre joined by Chief Commissioners for Human Rights from both sides of the border, namely:  The witnesses will answer MLAâs questions relating to Article 2 of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol.

We're back from lunch, and this is how things are looking on the Committee for the Executive Office's agenda this afternoon. It's due to open to the public shortly, so stay with us. We'll be back at 14:00 with live coverage of a meeting of the Committee for the Executive Office focusing on Brexit matters. Do join us then. In the meantime, we're going to grab a sandwich. Christopher Stalford of the DUP asks about support for those working in the hospitality sector. Mrs Foster says she is aware that any in that sector are working on limited contracts, often for a âminimum wageâ. âThere is a need for us to be aware of that,â she says, adding she is due to meet with representatives from Hospitality Ulster later today. Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP says the decisions being taken have âto be rightâ. She says âDerry is nine days into these restrictions alreadyâ and reads a letter she has received from a business leader in the area before asking the first minister for her thoughts. Mrs Foster says âI hear what sheâs saying in relation to the lowest paidâ. âI accept that footfall is down,â says Mrs Foster, with regard to shops. âYou can still travel in a taxi with all of the appropriate safeguards, but I do accept that there are people who will take this and will not want to be out and about,â she adds. âWe need to get that balance of keeping the economy going, I accept at a lesser level than we would like,â says Mrs Foster. Robbie Butler of the UUP asks the first minister to confirm there will be support for online learning and student support, if required. Mrs Foster says, âI have been clear that the last thing we want to do is get into that awful phrase yet again, of blended learningâ. She pays tribute to teachers for their efforts, adding âwe should always try and ensure our children have an education and our children are at schoolâ. âWe have to take into account the impact this will have on their life chances in the future,â says the first minister. SDLP MLA Pat Catney asks the first minister to provide businesses with âclarityâ and wants an outline of the support to be put in place. Mrs Foster says she accepts businesses need clarity, adding that is why they will be in place on Friday. She hopes the support package will be signed off tomorrow, she adds. Rachel Woods of the Green Party says there are ""so many questionsâ in relation to the regulations announced today. Mrs Foster says âI know there are a lot of people who are vulnerable, or who are perhaps older and who are very, very worried at presentâ. âI donât have all of the answers,â she adds. âWeâre dealing with a pandemic, weâre working at speed, and weâre trying to work through all of the answers.â âSix oâclock on Friday is the target for when these regulations will take effect.â Matthew OâToole of the SDLP says the statement today doesnât make clear that itâs ânot to beat the virus in the short termâ. He says âthe blunt truth is this is about buying time for our health service not to be overwhelmedâ. Mrs Foster responds, âwhat weâre trying to do is push down the transmission of the virusâ. She says the R rate, or rate of transmission is at present about 1.5, adding that the aim is to reduce it to below 1. âWe have to take these interventions now. Mr Speaker. as the virus has got out of control in some places,â says the first minister. âWeâre interfering with peopleâs lives,â she says, adding that is not something she wants to do. SinÃ©ad Bradley, also of the SDLP, asks about enforcement of the regulations. Mrs Foster says âwe will continue to work with those people who want to help us with compliance and enforcement of the regulationsâ. âPersonal responsibility is a wonderful thing,â she says. âIf people do what weâre asking them to do, then it has a consequence,â says the first minister. Dolores Kelly of the SDLP says there are âstill some concerns around schoolsâ and wants to know if the two-week period will be âused constructively by the education minister and othersâ to ensure âmore deprived childrenâ get additional support if required. Mrs Foster says âit is those children who donât have access to the internet, who donât have access to wi-fi, whose parents donât have an interest in educationâ that suffer when schools are not sitting. That concludes questions on the first minister's statement to the assembly. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster announces the new restrictions in Northern Ireland Schools will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday evening, in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. The moves are amongnew restrictions being imposed,externalby the executive. It comes as NI's Department of Health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Hospitality businesses will be limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday. Health officials had warned infections would rise further if both schools and hospitality premises remained open. Northern Ireland's health department has now recorded 23,115 cases since the pandemic began - a quarter of which have been reported in the past week. The executive has agreed schools will close for two weeks, including the half-term holiday, until Monday 2 November, when their closure will be reviewed. Education Minister Peter Weir vowed to oppose any move to extend school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. He said lengthening the Halloween mid-term break by a further week of holiday represented a ""compromise"" position within the Stormont Executive. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure but they were ""content"" with the decision. NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external Coronavirus Q&A: What has changed in NI? 'I think we're done' - Restaurant and bar owners react Sports hit by tighter measures Mrs Foster outlined the changes in a statement to assembly members. Further guidance is being issued that will also advise against unnecessary travel, and the executive will meet on Thursday to discuss further support packages for businesses concerned about what closures will mean for jobs and viability. Talks ran into the early hours of Wednesday as ministers tried to reach a compromise on a range of decisions, finally agreeing to impose the following measures for four weeks from Friday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households,other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.Â Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services -  prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting While there was no specific mention of hotels, it is understood they will also be closing for four weeks. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she was ""urgently engaging with executive colleagues to clarify the specifics of these new restrictions, and the potential impact on hotels, before they come into effect"". There is also likely to be more guidance on the likes of soft play areas, cinemas and swimming pools. There are new restrictions coming into place for weddings, civil ceremonies and funerals, which will be limited to 25 people from Monday with no receptions permitted. Face coverings will not be obligatory for such ceremonies in places of worship. Ministers have agreed no additional restrictions will be placed on shops, but there will be ""urgent engagement"" with the sector about extra measures to prevent further spread of the virus. Driving lessons will be allowed to continue. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds The current restrictions on household mixing are expected to remain as they are. That would mean no mixing of households in private homes - with exceptions including those joined in social bubbles - and gatherings in gardens limited to six people from no more than two households. Mrs Foster said the executive hoped the measures would reduce virus transmission rates, while reinforcing public health messaging. ""A lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention,"" she told the assembly. She also told the assembly there had been 485 coronavirus-related incidents schools - many involving a single case - and fewer than 10 schools required support for more than two cases. ""There are other issues around school gates and transport and issues like that but we are going to work with the education department about how we can minimise risks,"" she added. White smoke emerged shortly after 00:30 - the tradition of late Stormont nights making a return once more. Ministers had reconvened at 23:00 after tensions erupted earlier, with the SDLP and Alliance complaining they had been given too little time to scrutinise the proposals. One source said when the meeting first got under way, the atmosphere was ""horrendous"", but when ministers returned for the second time it's understood tempers had calmed and the midnight meeting was a more sombre affair. The nature of decision-making at Stormont sees five parties sharing power in a mandatory coalition - and their views have differed greatly at times during the pandemic. It appears the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in reached a compromise over the timing of school closures - for now - and whether to apply hospitality measures throughout Northern Ireland. Advice from health officials was that NI-wide restrictions had to be imposed by Friday. The executive seems to have listened to that recommendation, but some are asking why the parties laboured so long over the proposed plan, given the urgency of the situation. But these are seismic decisions: every step back into what resembles the original lockdown has ramifications. Ministers will also be facing questions about why they appear to have chosen to diverge from some of the health officials' original advice. Readmore from Jayne. The executive has also agreed to advise universities and further education colleges to run courses online. Queen's University Belfast has confirmed teaching will be carried out online for the rest of the semester, unless face-to-face work is considered ""essential or unavoidable."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who is self-isolating after a relative tested positive for coronavirus, said there would be no changes to childcare arrangements. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said the executive had given ""painstaking consideration"" to next steps. ""We will do everything we possibly can to make sure there are protections in place for businesses, workers and families,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

"As Northern Ireland heads into winter, a so-called circuit breaker is being considered to slow the spread of Covid-19 As coronavirus cases continue to rise again in NI, the possibility of imposing a so-called ""circuit breaker"" has been gaining traction. Stormont ministers have insisted it won't be a return to full lockdown like we experienced in March, so what would it look like? BBC News NI explains why it is being considered, the impacts it could have and when it might take effect. It is a short, sharp period of tightened restrictions for everyone to curb the spread of coronavirus, usually lasting about two weeks. It gained traction in London last month, with Number 10 proposing it as one way of trying to halt the rapid growth in infections. Other countries such asNew ZealandandSingaporehave previously deployed the strategy. The number of Covid-19 cases in Northern Irelandhas jumped dramaticallyin recent weeks. Although hospital admissions and numbers of patients in intensive care remain low, health officials remain concerned that the situation could spiral out of control into the winter season, unless more drastic measures are taken soon. The Department of Health has saidthere could be 1,000 new coronavirus cases every dayin Northern Ireland in a month's time, if the current trend continues. Covid-19 numbers in Northern Ireland have jumped dramatically in recent weeks The rate of new deaths following a positive test for Covid-19 has also begun to rise and the R number - or rate of transmission of the virus - is currently estimated at about 1.5. That's why the idea of a circuit breaker remains on the table, with NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young saying it is ""one of the more powerful interventionsin terms of reducing the transmission of the virus"". It needs to be long enough to break the chains of transmission - but short enough to minimise the effect on the economy. Its length would be pre-determined and likely to last a maximum of two or three weeks. Health Minister Robin Swann has said there would be a ""timeliness"" to introduce the measure around the half-term Halloween holidays, but warned that if cases continued rising sharply, it may need to be brought in sooner. The executive has said that keeping schools open remains its top priority, with First Minister Arlene Foster sayingthere would not be a return to a situation where schools close again, like they did in March. The executive has said that keeping schools open is a priority If, as anticipated, the executive implements the move in the run-up to Halloween, there could be an extended break for schools, as opposed to the one-week half term they normally get at this time of year. BBC News NI understands there are ongoing discussions within the Department of Education about the break lasting as long as three weeks. If that was the case, schools could be asked to stay open for children of key workers, but most pupils would be taught remotely for two of those weeks. Practically, it could mean an end to going to the pub or to restaurants for the duration of the circuit breaker. The hospitality industry in NI is already required to close at 23:00, but additionallocal restrictions currently apply in Derry City and Strabane council area, where pubs, hotel bars and restaurants can only offer takeaway, delivery, and outdoor dining. Executive ministers have already said those measures may have to be extended across other parts of Northern Ireland soon. A circuit breaker could also mean stricter guidance on people working from home, and advice against travel out of your local area. It is not clear if some close contact services - such as hair and beauty salons - would be advised to close, and whether the executive would issue further advice on weddings, funerals and church services. The exact impact on jobs is also uncertain,given the furlough scheme is due to end on 31 October, which could coincide with a circuit breaker. Economy Minister Diane Dodds has argued strongly that further measures to curb the spread of the virus will have a negative impact on businesses. She has called for an economic analysis to be carried out on the measure before the executive agrees to introduce it. Economy Minister Diane Dodds has called for an analysis to be carried out before the executive agrees to further measures Her officials have warned that Northern Ireland ""cannot afford another lockdown"", and that there could bemore than 100,000 unemployment claimants in Northern Ireland by the end of this year. Other executive ministers have also been pressing Westminster for commitments of additional money, in the event that tighter Covid restrictions are brought in. In reality, the executive will have to balance its health plans to tackle the virus with its reliance on the British government for extra financial support. On Friday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said employees who work for UK firms forced to shut by law because of coronavirus restrictions will get two-thirds of their wages paid for by the government. He said this was an ""expansion"" of the Job Support Scheme, which begins on 1 November and will be available for six months. As a result, Northern Ireland and the other devolved nations will automatically get a rise in funding through what's known as a Barnett consequential. Stormont ministers will be keeping a keen eye on Westminster for an anticipated restrictions update on Monday, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas. The executive is also conscious of the land border shared with the Republic of Ireland, and there have been calls for an all-island approach to any further measures. On Tuesday, the Irish governmentrejected advice from its public health officialsto move the whole country to the tightest level of restrictions, arguing that the proposals went too far. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has put in place additional restrictions for the country's hospitality sector, althoughshe said this did not mean a return to ""full lockdown"". There is growing speculation that a circuit breaker for Northern Ireland could be announced soon. Last Sunday, Dr Gerry Waldron of the Public Health Agency said it was ""almost inevitable"", while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said if Northern Ireland was moving towards that, then ""people should be informed that's where we are going"" through clear communication. Any recommendations from Stormont's Department of Health will need to be approved by the whole executive, where opinions among the five parties have varied greatly during the pandemic. It is also possible that if the strategy is implemented and works, then it could be deployed again, if deemed appropriate by the executive.

"Online fashion group Asos added three million customers in the past year, with annual profits jumping thanks to cost-cutting and buyers returning fewer items amid the pandemic. It now has 23.4 million customers, with more than seven million in the UK, where it makes the bulk of profits. Worldwide sales were up 19%, and pre-tax profits 329% at Â£142.1m, driven partly by fewer returned goods. But Asos said it was worried about unemployment hitting young customers. It singled out those in their 20s, for whom it said life was unlikely to return to normal for ""quite some time"". The company's chief executive, Nick Beighton, also said he was expecting a ""very promotional"" trading period, starting at Halloween. He also warned his company could take a hard hit from Brexit: ""If there is a Brexit deal with tariffs we would have to suck up a substantial amount of operating cost."" Susannah Streeter, investment analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the company was vulnerable in the face of continuing coronavirus restrictions: ""A depressed economic outlook may push down demand to refresh wardrobes. ""With venues forced to close at 10pm and the Christmas party season cancelled, profits from party wear will be thin. Job prospects are uncertain for its core group of customers in their 20s and so the company will have to be very choosy about the ranges and prices it offers."" Investors had marked the shares down 10% by lunchtime on worries trading could be tougher in the next few months. As an online retailer, Asos is one of the few retailers that have benefitted from lockdown. The company said in August it was expecting to see growth in profits and sales and these figures are at the higher end of the forecasts given then. It also said buying habits had changed to reflect lifestyle changes enforced by the pandemic, and its customers were buying less special occasion-wear and more face products and leisurewear, fewer of which were likely to be returned. Like other online players, Asos had struggled with large volumes of returns in the past and had even threatened to block serial returners in 2019. However, its profit margin dipped slightly and it was cautious over the outlook for consumer demand as it said ""economic prospects and lifestyles of 20-somethings remain disrupted"" due to the coronavirus crisis. Nick Beighton said: ""After a record first half which saw us make progress in addressing the performance issues of the previous financial year, the second half will always be defined by our response to Covid-19."" He added: ""I am pleased by the improvements we have made this year but there is still more for us to do to continue our progress. ""Whilst life for our 20-something customers is unlikely to return to normal for quite some time, Asos will continue to engage, respond and adapt as one of the few truly global leaders in online fashion retail.""

"Boris Johnson faced questions from MPs as a new three-tier alert system has taken effect in England, with millions of people facing extra curbs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer again questioned why the UK PM did not opt for a limited national lockdown Wales will ban entry to people from coronavirus hotspots by Friday if there are no UK-wide restrictions, the first minister says Schools in Northern Ireland will close for two weeks and hospitality businesses face tighter restrictions France introduces a 'state of health emergency', coming into force at the weekend Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia has said bars and restaurants are to close for 15 days from Thursday Restrictions are tightening across the continent as cases rise - a partial lockdown comes in in the Netherlands at 2200 (2000 GMT) The World Bank said it will supply $12bn (Â£9.3bn) to help developing countries purchase and distribute vaccines, tests and treatment There are 38 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with 1.08 million deaths Claire Heald So, it is au revoir, goodbye, from our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, and do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Claire Heald, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Cheetham, Lauren Turner, Mal Siret and Sophie Williams. It's been another busy day of coronavirus developments, with the latest being the new measures in France. Here's what else has been happening both in the UK and across the world this Wednesday.   Almost an hour into his TV appearance tonight, French President Macron has called for national unity, saying ""we will get through this together"". Earlier he announced that, from Saturday, a four-week night-time curfew will be in place in Paris and eight other cities. He will also seek parliamentary approval to extend this to six weeks. ""If, during these six weeks, we follow the curfew, we act collectively to reduce the number of contacts, thatâs the point at which we think we can progressively start to open again,"" said Mr Macron. ""Iâm being very careful here because experience has shown that we can cannot control everything,"" he added. ""We canât outline everything but six weeks seems to us to be the best duration for our actions."" French President Macron is being interviewed by two journalists on TV for these announcements this evening, and he's said that people can still meet outside of curfew hours. But he urged people to limit family gatherings to no more than six people. The president said exceptions could be made for those with over six people in their immediate families. Emmanuel Macron said that anyone violating the curfew being imposed in major cities in France would be fined 135 euros ($158.61). The nightly curfew will affect almost one third of the country's 67 million people. A new national lockdown is not expected, however. Mr Macron said of the curfew: ""We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 pm. We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."" President Macron says during France's curfew, people will not be allowed to visit friends. All theatres, restaurants and bars will need to close during curfew, he added. There will not be any travel restrictions between regions of France however and no restrictions on public transport. Work and schools are also to continue as normal. From Saturday, curfews will be in place in the French capital, Paris, and eight other cities including Grenoble, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse, President Emmanuel Macron announces. The restriction will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00 local time. And is to last for at least four weeks. It comes as France re-imposes a state of health emergency to contain the spread of coronavirus. French President Emmanuel Macron's imminent announcement comes as French authorities say the number of people being treated in hospital has risen above 9,100 for the first time since 25 June. The fear is the growing number of cases could overwhelm the country's hospital system. See more graphs here. France is re-imposing a state of health emergency to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government says. It comes shortly before President Emmanuel Macron is due to appear on national television at 19:00 GMT. He is expected to detail fresh coronavirus measures. The change will allow ""measures proportional to the health risks to be taken"", and will come into force on Saturday, according to minutes from a cabinet meeting and reported by AFP. The country, like many European nations, is grappling with rising case numbers in the pandemic's second wave. Macron will give interviews with two French journalists in his TV appearance, his office says. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said lockdowns may be introduced again if infection rates do not improve in hard-hit areas. Record numbers of cases of coronavirus are continuing to be announced around Europe today, as the continent grapples with a fresh wave of infections. Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic, has reported 7,332 new infections - its highest daily increase on record. Romania has also added a record 4,016 cases to its tally. And as we reported earlier, records have been broken today in Russia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile 11,970 new cases have been reported in Spain. While not a record, it comes as Spain continues to report the highest number of infections in Europe - currently over 908,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. We've been hearing today about the new ""tier"" levels of coronavirus alert in England, which put areas in medium, high and very high categories of risk and restriction. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be under the toughest Tier Three Covid-19 restrictions which came into effect at midnight, making it illegal for gyms in the area to open. But some gyms in Liverpool are staying open - despite being ordered to close. Chris Ellerby-Hemmings, co-owner of EmpoweredFit gym in the Wirral, said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members' mental and physical wellbeing. The reason for doing it is to be listened to."" The gym, which has 14,000 members, isone of dozens in Merseyside that have remained open. Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. But Mr Ellerby-Hemmings told the BBC his gym was Covid secure. The BBC has contacted the Liverpool City Regional Combined Authority and Merseyside Police for comment. With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. BBC Newsbeat The number of mental health referrals for under-18shalved in the first two months of lockdown, according to new data. Young people who weren't able to get NHS support said they didn't know where to go for help and felt like they ""didn't really matter"". Charities are worried that a drop like this could happen again if there are further lockdowns around the UK. The data, obtained by Newsbeat, indicated that the number of people in England referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) dropped by 47% during April and May, compared with the same months in 2019. CAMHS is the name for NHS mental health support for people until they are 18. Replies to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 40 NHS Trusts in England showed 22,735 patients were referred, compared to 42,887 patients in that same two months last year. Another 10 trusts weren't able to answer within the deadline. Manchester's German-themed Christmas markets have been cancelled this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Hopes of having even three small mini-markets have also been abandoned due to fears of the spread of coronavirus. Manchester City Council has already scrapped any organised Bonfire night events while the switching on of the city's Christmas lights will not be marked formally, and New Year's Eve will not have a fireworks display. Meanwhile in Germany itself, authorities are weighing up whether to go ahead with their own Christmas markets. Several state leaders, including Bavaria's Markus SÃ¶der, have said the events could still be held, but with compulsory mask-wearing for guests, along with other preventative measures. Earlier today, we reported that bars and restaurants in the Spanish region of Catalonia will be closing from tomorrow, for 15 days, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to serve takeaway and delivery orders, but locals have been sharing their concerns with Reuters news agency. ""This will be the end for us,"" said restaurant manager Benito Mateo. ""The restaurant industry was already bad but with this it will be total chaos.â Restaurant customer Pilar Ferrer has also described the decision as ""very risky"". ""On the one hand I feel bad for them because they will earn less money, but I also consider that it is a sanitary measure and that it must be respected,"" he added. There were 647 patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England on Monday, the day the most recent data is available from - up from 472 the previous week. It brought the total, since the pandemic began, to 125,343. There are currently, as of Wednesday, 4,146 people in hospital in England. A week ago, there were 2,944 in hospital. The different nations of the UK report their hospital figures in a slightly different way, so information from Wednesday is not available everywhere yet. In Scotland, 527 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 262 a week earlier. In Wales, 345 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Tuesday, up from 261 a week earlier. And in Northern Ireland, 150 Covid-19 patients were in hospital as of Monday, up from 129 the previous week. M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Authorities in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital Karachi have
ordered more than 20 daily markets to close indefinitely amid fears of a rise
in Covid infections as winter approaches. The ""bachat"" (savings) bazaars told to shut are all
in central Karachi, where cases are higher than average. In recent weeks city
authorities have enforced ""micro lockdowns"" in more than two dozen areas. The markets were launched in the 1980s to
provide food, clothing and other goods at cheaper prices for the less well-off. Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, has less
than a quarter of Pakistan's population but accounts for nearly half of its
total coronavirus infections and deaths. Last month, most bazaars started to reopen
after a strict lockdown was eased in Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh. As case numbers continue to grow around Europe, here are some of the biggest developments from across the continent: Northern Ireland's Nightingale hospital will reopen, health minister Robin Swann says. The temporary facility at Belfast City Hospital was stood down in May when coronavirus cases decreased. Mr Swann said the hospital had to be formally established again due to ""rapidly escalating pressures"" across all of NI's health trusts. ""It is not something I wanted to do - it was a decision I tried to hold off on for as long as possible,"" he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Online fashion group Asos added three million customers in the past year, with annual profits jumping thanks to cost-cutting and buyers returning fewer items amid the pandemic. It now has 23.4 million customers, with more than seven million in the UK, where it makes the bulk of profits. Worldwide sales were up 19%, and pre-tax profits 329% at Â£142.1m, driven partly by fewer returned goods. But Asos said it was worried about unemployment hitting young customers. It singled out those in their 20s, for whom it said life was unlikely to return to normal for ""quite some time"". The company's chief executive, Nick Beighton, also said he was expecting a ""very promotional"" trading period, starting at Halloween. He also warned his company could take a hard hit from Brexit: ""If there is a Brexit deal with tariffs we would have to suck up a substantial amount of operating cost."" Susannah Streeter, investment analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the company was vulnerable in the face of continuing coronavirus restrictions: ""A depressed economic outlook may push down demand to refresh wardrobes. ""With venues forced to close at 10pm and the Christmas party season cancelled, profits from party wear will be thin. Job prospects are uncertain for its core group of customers in their 20s and so the company will have to be very choosy about the ranges and prices it offers."" Investors had marked the shares down 10% by lunchtime on worries trading could be tougher in the next few months. As an online retailer, Asos is one of the few retailers that have benefitted from lockdown. The company said in August it was expecting to see growth in profits and sales and these figures are at the higher end of the forecasts given then. It also said buying habits had changed to reflect lifestyle changes enforced by the pandemic, and its customers were buying less special occasion-wear and more face products and leisurewear, fewer of which were likely to be returned. Like other online players, Asos had struggled with large volumes of returns in the past and had even threatened to block serial returners in 2019. However, its profit margin dipped slightly and it was cautious over the outlook for consumer demand as it said ""economic prospects and lifestyles of 20-somethings remain disrupted"" due to the coronavirus crisis. Nick Beighton said: ""After a record first half which saw us make progress in addressing the performance issues of the previous financial year, the second half will always be defined by our response to Covid-19."" He added: ""I am pleased by the improvements we have made this year but there is still more for us to do to continue our progress. ""Whilst life for our 20-something customers is unlikely to return to normal for quite some time, Asos will continue to engage, respond and adapt as one of the few truly global leaders in online fashion retail.""

"This video can not be played Covid circuit breakers are doomed to fail, says disease expert Ministers are ""planning very seriously"" for a circuit breaker lockdown for Wales, the first minister has said. ""We're very actively talking about and preparing for that should it be necessary,"" Mark Drakeford told Sky News. The short-term measurescould include closing pubs and restaurants. However disease expert Dr Roland Salmon said such circuit breaker lockdowns were ""doomed to failure"" and would only bring ""cost without benefit"". Acircuit breakeris a short, set period of maybe two or three weeks, where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. The UK government's Scientific Advisory Committee (Sage) urged forthe introduction of circuit breaker restrictions three weeks ago. Mr Drakeford said: ""We want to act now in order to prevent the worst from happening, to give us a better chance of getting through the rest of the autumn and the winter, and if a circuit breaker is the right way to do it then that is what we will do. ""I'm not announcing it today but I do want people to know we are planning very seriously, so if we do need to do it we'll be in a position to do it and in a position to do it quickly."" Mr Drakeford has already called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene a Cobra meeting so that all four UK nations could discuss the measure. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said earlier on Wednesday a decision would be made in the next few days on the issue in Wales A circuit break would see tighter restrictions would be brought in for a short period Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a circuit breaker lockdown was needed to provide time to get the test and trace system ""in order"" and prevent the NHS from being ""overwhelmed"". He said there should also be a full reintroduction of the furlough scheme, financial help for businesses and support for people asked to self-isolate. ""Unless we take action, our NHS could be overwhelmed and unable to contend with a second wave which may well be worse than the first."" When asked about a circuit breaker on Wednesday morning, Mr Gething told BBC Breakfast the school half term - staring on 26 October - was a ""potential way to introduce a break"" if it was decided to do so. However Dr Salmon, former director of communicable diseases at Public Health Wales, said it will not suppress the virus. He said any short-term measures - lasting between two and three weeks - would not be long enough to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from households where people are infectious but do not show symptoms. ""I simply don't think a circuit breaker will work,"" he said. ""It won't work because even Sage (UK government Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies) in its consideration thought it would only delay matters, not suppress the virus altogether."" What can I do during local lockdowns? Social distancing needed 'until vaccine found' 'Rolling lockdowns' will become the norm in Wales Whatever period was chosen for a circuit breaker, infectious people would still be released back into the community, he said. The retired epidemiologist, who led the response to the E-coli outbreak in south Wales in 2005, believes governments should ""rethink the whole model"" and focus more on shielding the most vulnerable sections of the community, rather than placing restrictions on those considered to be at lower risk. ""We should be shielding older people, shielding at-risk occupations and for track and trace the priority should be on those places we know the virus is transmitted, like hospitals, care homes, meat factories, prisons or even universities,"" he said. ""We need a rational approach that's so far been lacking."" His view was echoed by Prof Dale Andrew Fisher, who specialises in infectious diseases at the National University Hospital, Singapore, and is part of the World Health Organisation's outbreak alert and response network. He said circuit breakers were a short-term fix and were not ""sustainable"". ""It has to be just to buy time or to recover, but really this virus is going to be with us for a lot longer yet,"" he told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast ""We don't expect to be vaccinating most of the world until 2022 so we have to learn to live with this virus and we have to be able to go to school, go to work, do our normal activities in a Covid-safe way, limiting the impact of social and economic needs."" He added: ""You shouldn't need to do this if you can ramp up contact tracing, get all your contacts in quarantine, isolating all the positive cases. ""It needs to be part of a strategy, not 'lets do a circuit breaker, numbers are down, let's open up again'."" It is not clear if a circuit breaker would see schools close in Wales, as ishappening in Northern Ireland from Monday. Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said any circuit break should be Wales-wide and not down to individual local authorities as confusion causes ""more harm than good"". She said: ""The concern for schools is always going to be what about the vulnerable pupils."" She said a circuit breaker would be ""another issue"" for parents but added: ""On the flipside, this option would be a much needed break for teaching staff at this time.""

"Edwin Connington has not had human contact with his family since March Hundreds of strangers have wished a care home resident happy birthday after learning he would turn 100 in isolation from his family. Well-wishers have sent cards and presents to Edwin Connington, who has not hugged his daughter since March. ""The post lady turned up this morning with another load,"" said Phil Potter, of Aran Court care home in Birmingham. Daughter Pam Stallard-Connington said her father would be ""emotional and overwhelmed"" by people's generosity.

News of his 100th birthday was shared on BBC Radio WM as part of the station'sMake a Differencecampaign, which was set up to help people through the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of people sent messages of congratulations on social media to be included in a giant birthday card.

The retired epidemiologist, who led the response to the E-coli outbreak in south Wales in 2005, believes governments should ""rethink the whole model"" and focus more on shielding the most vulnerable sections of the community, rather than placing restrictions on those considered to be at lower risk. ""We should be shielding older people, shielding at-risk occupations and for track and trace the priority should be on those places we know the virus is transmitted, like hospitals, care homes, meat factories, prisons or even universities,"" he said. ""We need a rational approach that's so far been lacking."" His view was echoed by Prof Dale Andrew Fisher, who specialises in infectious diseases at the National University Hospital, Singapore, and is part of the World Health Organisation's outbreak alert and response network. He said circuit breakers were a short-term fix and were not ""sustainable"". ""It has to be just to buy time or to recover, but really this virus is going to be with us for a lot longer yet,"" he told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast ""We don't expect to be vaccinating most of the world until 2022 so we have to learn to live with this virus and we have to be able to go to school, go to work, do our normal activities in a Covid-safe way, limiting the impact of social and economic needs."" He added: ""You shouldn't need to do this if you can ramp up contact tracing, get all your contacts in quarantine, isolating all the positive cases. ""It needs to be part of a strategy, not 'lets do a circuit breaker, numbers are down, let's open up again'."" It is not clear if a circuit breaker would see schools close in Wales, as ishappening in Northern Ireland from Monday. Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said any circuit break should be Wales-wide and not down to individual local authorities as confusion causes ""more harm than good"". She said: ""The concern for schools is always going to be what about the vulnerable pupils."" She said a circuit breaker would be ""another issue"" for parents but added: ""On the flipside, this option would be a much needed break for teaching staff at this time.""

"Cardinal Giovanni Becciu was removed from his post last month Police in Milan say they have arrested a 39-year-old Italian woman, who has worked for Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a senior Vatican official who was demoted last month over embezzlement claims. Cecilia Marogna says she was paid â¬500,000 ($587,000; Â£454,000) by Cardinal Becciu. Ms Marogna was arrested after an Interpol warrant was issued at the Holy See's request, according to reports. Both Ms Marogna and Cardinal Becciu have denied any wrongdoing. In interviews with Italian media in recent days, Ms Marogna confirmed that she had been paid â¬500,000 by Cardinal Becciu through a company she operated in Slovenia. She said she received the money to provide ""parallel diplomacy"" to help missionaries in conflict areas. A senior Vatican source told Reuters news agency that Ms Marogna was suspected of ""embezzlement and aggravated misappropriation in complicity with others"". The cardinal allegedly authorised the payments to Ms Marogna while serving as number two in the Vatican's Secretariat of State, which manages the Church's donations. Cardinal forced out in rare Vatican resignation ""I didn't steal a single euro,"" Ms Marogna told newspaper Domani. She has also denied allegations that she is the cardinal's mistress, telling the newspaper Corriere della Sera that she is a ""political analyst and intelligence expert"" with ""a network of relationships in Africa and the Middle East"" to protect the Vatican's representatives abroad. Cardinal Becciu, 72, unexpectedly resigned last month, revealing he was told to do so by Pope Francis. He said he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers. The cardinal was involved in a controversial deal to invest in a luxury London building with Church funds, which has since been the subject of a financial investigation. The cardinal has denied any wrongdoing and has defended the London property deal. Resignations at this level of the Vatican are extremely rare.

"Cafe owner Diane Cheshire said people were confused about the rules Business owners in Llanelli say people are ""making their own rules up"" because of confusion over Covid-19 restrictions. Shops and cafes have seen a dramatic drop in trade since the first town-only lockdown in Wales was announced nearly three weeks ago. Diane Cheshire, from Joly's Cafe in the town centre, said people were ""not sure what is the right thing to do"". Public Health Wales said restrictions would last at least another week. Wales' first town-only lockdown takes effect Three more areas of Wales to go into lockdown What can I do during local lockdowns? Ms Cheshire, who has has owned and run the cafe for more than 20 years, said she has never seen the town so quiet. ""I'm very worried to be honest. I don't want total lockdown but that's the only way to stop this,"" she said. She said the differences in rules in different areas meant people were ""making their own rules up because they're not sure what is the right thing to do"". ""I can't see an end to it. It's going to take a long time to even remotely get back to normal."" The case rate in Llanelli has reduced from 152 per 100,000 of the population to 99.9. But this compares with a 58.8 per 100,000 case rate for the county of Carmarthenshire as a whole. Public Health Wales said that while the signs are encouraging, the restrictions need to stay in place in the town for at least another week. Business owners said the uncertainty was crippling their trade. Llanelli was the first town-only lockdown in Wales Andrew Jones, who owns the D&A Heel Bar in Llanelli market, said: ""I know people are afraid to come out because they're shielding but it doesn't help business for me. ""I do have an older customer base here. I can understand they're afraid to come out. We're doing as much as we can to help them, offering collections service where possible, but people are frustrated - they can't see an end in sight."" Llanelli town councillor Sean Rees said people living in his ward of Glanymor were confused about the rules. ""We need much clearer communication coming through to the community, particularly for our businesses,"" he said. ""Our town centre is very much open for business for people within the area and I'd encourage people to shop locally to support family-run businesses and market traders, because they need our help right now."" Carmarthenshire County Council said social distancing and behaviour inside licensed premises like pubs and clubs continued to cause concern. The authority confirmed it had issued temporary closure notices for 10 premises within the last two weeks.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster announces the new restrictions in Northern Ireland Schools will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday evening, in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. The moves are amongnew restrictions being imposed,externalby the executive. It comes as NI's Department of Health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Hospitality businesses will be limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday. Health officials had warned infections would rise further if both schools and hospitality premises remained open. Northern Ireland's health department has now recorded 23,115 cases since the pandemic began - a quarter of which have been reported in the past week. The executive has agreed schools will close for two weeks, including the half-term holiday, until Monday 2 November, when their closure will be reviewed. Education Minister Peter Weir vowed to oppose any move to extend school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. He said lengthening the Halloween mid-term break by a further week of holiday represented a ""compromise"" position within the Stormont Executive. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure but they were ""content"" with the decision. NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external Coronavirus Q&A: What has changed in NI? 'I think we're done' - Restaurant and bar owners react Sports hit by tighter measures Mrs Foster outlined the changes in a statement to assembly members. Further guidance is being issued that will also advise against unnecessary travel, and the executive will meet on Thursday to discuss further support packages for businesses concerned about what closures will mean for jobs and viability. Talks ran into the early hours of Wednesday as ministers tried to reach a compromise on a range of decisions, finally agreeing to impose the following measures for four weeks from Friday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households,other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.Â Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services -  prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting While there was no specific mention of hotels, it is understood they will also be closing for four weeks. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she was ""urgently engaging with executive colleagues to clarify the specifics of these new restrictions, and the potential impact on hotels, before they come into effect"". There is also likely to be more guidance on the likes of soft play areas, cinemas and swimming pools. There are new restrictions coming into place for weddings, civil ceremonies and funerals, which will be limited to 25 people from Monday with no receptions permitted. Face coverings will not be obligatory for such ceremonies in places of worship. Ministers have agreed no additional restrictions will be placed on shops, but there will be ""urgent engagement"" with the sector about extra measures to prevent further spread of the virus. Driving lessons will be allowed to continue. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds The current restrictions on household mixing are expected to remain as they are. That would mean no mixing of households in private homes - with exceptions including those joined in social bubbles - and gatherings in gardens limited to six people from no more than two households. Mrs Foster said the executive hoped the measures would reduce virus transmission rates, while reinforcing public health messaging. ""A lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention,"" she told the assembly. She also told the assembly there had been 485 coronavirus-related incidents schools - many involving a single case - and fewer than 10 schools required support for more than two cases. ""There are other issues around school gates and transport and issues like that but we are going to work with the education department about how we can minimise risks,"" she added. White smoke emerged shortly after 00:30 - the tradition of late Stormont nights making a return once more. Ministers had reconvened at 23:00 after tensions erupted earlier, with the SDLP and Alliance complaining they had been given too little time to scrutinise the proposals. One source said when the meeting first got under way, the atmosphere was ""horrendous"", but when ministers returned for the second time it's understood tempers had calmed and the midnight meeting was a more sombre affair. The nature of decision-making at Stormont sees five parties sharing power in a mandatory coalition - and their views have differed greatly at times during the pandemic. It appears the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in reached a compromise over the timing of school closures - for now - and whether to apply hospitality measures throughout Northern Ireland. Advice from health officials was that NI-wide restrictions had to be imposed by Friday. The executive seems to have listened to that recommendation, but some are asking why the parties laboured so long over the proposed plan, given the urgency of the situation. But these are seismic decisions: every step back into what resembles the original lockdown has ramifications. Ministers will also be facing questions about why they appear to have chosen to diverge from some of the health officials' original advice. Readmore from Jayne. The executive has also agreed to advise universities and further education colleges to run courses online. Queen's University Belfast has confirmed teaching will be carried out online for the rest of the semester, unless face-to-face work is considered ""essential or unavoidable."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who is self-isolating after a relative tested positive for coronavirus, said there would be no changes to childcare arrangements. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said the executive had given ""painstaking consideration"" to next steps. ""We will do everything we possibly can to make sure there are protections in place for businesses, workers and families,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

"Ine Eriksen Soreide did not say what evidence there was for Russian involvement Norway has blamed Russia for a cyber-attack on the email system in the Norwegian parliament in August. Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide called it a serious incident affecting the country's ""most important democratic institution."" ""Based on the information available to the government it is our assessment that Russia stood behind this activity"" she said without giving any evidence. Moscow has rejected the claim, calling it a ""serious and wilful provocation."" Ms Soreidesaid in a statement,externalthat Norway's security and intelligence services were ""co-operating closely to deal with this matter at the national level."" In response,Russia's embassy in Oslo hit back,externalat the ""unacceptable"" announcement, saying no evidence had been presented. ""Millions of cyber attacks are annually committed from abroad against Russian state internet resources... but this does not give us the right to indiscriminately blame authorities of the countries of their possible origin,"" the embassy added. In September, Norwegian authorities said that email accounts belonging to several officials had been compromised during a cyber-attack, and some information had been downloaded. But the full extent of damage caused by the hack has not been made public. Norway's allegation comes during a time of increasingly strained relations with Russia. Both countries share an Arctic border, and Norway is a member of Nato. The email accounts of several officials were compromised during the attack on Norway's parliament In August, Norway expelled a Russian diplomat on suspicion of spying. Russia retaliated by expelling a Norwegian diplomat days later. Norway also arrested a Russian national in 2018 who was suspected of gathering information on the country's parliamentary network. The individual was later released due to a lack of evidence. In a report earlier this year, Norway's military intelligence agency warned that Russia was trying to fuel discord in the country through so-called influence operations, aimed at weakening public trust in the government, election processes and the media. National legislatures are a key source of policy-related information, and so are frequently targeted by hacking campaigns. In January, the personal details of hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, were stolen and published online. And last year, Australia's cyber-intelligence agency blamed China after hackers tried to break into the Australian parliament, something Chinese officials denied.

"Many company boards look like nothing has changed since the 1970s, says Nels Abbey ""On my first day in my first banking job I was waiting in the reception area and was mistaken by the entire company for a security guard,"" says author and satirist Nels Abbey. ""They all showed me their ID cards one by one as they came in."" It was just one of many examples of racism he experienced as a black man working in the City and later for big media companies, including shocking pay disparities and few opportunities for promotion. Mr Abbey, who has written a book about his experiences, Think Like a White Man, says the lack of black people at the top in business is a big part of the problem, andlike others he is calling for change. Britain's biggest business lobby group, the CBI, has just unveiled a campaignto get at least one ethnic minority person onto every FTSE 100 boardand every FTSE 250 one by 2024. It says that more than a third of the boards of the biggest listed UK businesses are still all-white, with that rising to two thirds in smaller public companies. Meanwhile, one of the UK's biggest investment firms L&G saysit will use its vote to put pressure on bosses who don't make their top teams more diverse by 2022, putting the people responsible for board appointments in the firing line. ""You need people on the board who actually reflect your customers and society, but a lot of boards look like nothing has changed since the 1970s,"" says Mr Abbey. ""You think, there are almost two million black people in the country, surely one of those people are good enough to be on your board."" Boards help direct a company's affairs, so making them more diverse helps to change attitudes across the whole company, experts say. It makes business sense too. Those with more ethnically diverse senior leadership teams are on average 36% more profitable, according to research from consultancy McKinsey. Lord Karan Bilimoria founded Cobra beer in 1989 Lord Karan Bilimoria, the CBI's president and co-founder of the well-known beer brand Cobra, says he's seen the benefits first hand, both in his own business and in other firms whose boards he has sat on. ""In the early days of building up Cobra our company literally was a mini United Nations. We had Americans, Europeans, people from different parts of South Asia, different religions, races and creeds,"" he tells the BBC. But the British-Indian businessman says too few firms offer such an ""amazing melting pot"" and change has been ""painfully slow"". 'I altered my personality to fit in at work' That is why he is spearheading the group's Change the Race Ratio campaign, which also calls for companies to set tough targets to improve diversity and publish them within 12 months. It won't be easy. The CBI's 2021 goal for ethnic diversity on FTSE 100 boards was actually recommended by the government-commissioned Parker Review back in 2016, and earlier this year that report's author saidit would be ""challenging"" to meet,external. But Lord Bilimoria thinks the appetite for change is growing, with this summer's Black Lives Matter protests lending a new urgency to the cause. ""We had the Davies Review [on improving the gender balance on boards] in 2011, and just last week we heard in the FTSE 350 there is only one company now that does not have a woman on their board,"" he says. ""Our aim is to do the same for ethnicity."" Mr Abbey thinks the CBI is sincere but believes it will take ""more muscle"" to fix the problem. He prefers L&G's approach, saying that ""things change when money talks"". For many, however, there won't be real change until the government steps in - something Theresa May's government promised to do after the Parker Review. She launched a consultation on making it mandatory for companies with over 250 staff to report their ethnicity pay gaps - the difference between what white members of staff get in average pay versus those from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME). A similar requirement to publish gender pay gaps came into effect in 2017, with the first reports being due in April 2018. But the results of Mrs May's consultation on ethnicity have never been published. Sandra Kerr CBE says the death of George Floyd has ""turbo charged the issue"" Sandra Kerr CBE, race equality director at the charity Business in the Community, and a former Cabinet Office adviser, says the government has had a lot on its plate but now needs to act. Pay reporting would not be a ""silver bullet"" but would ""focus minds and improve accountability"", she says. ""I have had countless conversations with government ministers about this... Everybody agrees we want inclusion, can we just move it along?"" Some companies fear asking staff for information about their ethnicity could infringe their privacy, but Ms Kerr is not convinced. She adds that the desire for change is only getting stronger after the death of George Floyd in the US in May ""turbo-charged the issue"". The charity's own Race at Work Charter, which helps big firms devise plans to improve diversity, now has 480 signatories, up from 250 before the summer. ""Things were changing before George Floyd. But the protests have seen white and black people out there asking for change, that was the real difference."" The government says it is still looking at ways to strengthen requirements around reporting on diversity. It also plans to launch a cross-government commission to examine continuing racial inequalities. A business department spokesman said: ""Building a fairer economy means ensuring the UK's organisations reflect the nation's diversity - from factory floor to boardroom. We are working closely with businesses to consider what steps can be taken to build more inclusive workplaces, including reporting on diversity.""

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says a two to three week âcircuit breakâ in England will require âsignificant sacrificesâ Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England of two to three weeks to bring the rising rate of coronavirus under control. He said measures were not working and another course was needed to prevent a ""sleepwalk into... a bleak winter"". His comments come after documents revealedgovernment scientific advisers called for such actionthree weeks ago. Another 143 people have died in the UK after testing positive for the virus. MPs haveapproved the legislation to write a new three-tier systemfor coronavirus restrictions in England into law - with every area of the country classified as being on medium, high or very high alert. What is a circuit break? Laura Kuenssberg: Can Johnson hold out against more restrictions? Are we still listening to the science on Covid? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Sir Keir said his lockdown proposal would ""not mean schools closing"" but it should ""run across half-term to minimise disruption"". However, he said it would mean that ""all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed"" and compensated ""so that no business loses out because of the sacrifices we all need to make"". ""The government has not got a credible plan to slow infections. It has lost control of the virus and it's no longer following scientific advice,"" Sir Keir said. He suggested it would also provide a chance for the government to ""fix"" problems by handing over track and trace responsibilities to local authorities. Documents detailing advice from scientists,externalon the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) were released on Monday night. Their views and evidence feed into the government's decision making. Sir Keir said his proposals were ""in line with Sage's recommendation"" for a circuit breaker to lower the reproduction number, or R value, of the virus - but acknowledged they would require significant sacrifices. He said: Only essential work and travel would be allowed and everyone who can work from home should do so Non-essential offices should be closed Household mixing should be restricted to one household except for those who have formed support bubbles UK Parliament should ""move to remote working"" Meanwhile, Wales' first minister has said he had asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a special Cobra meeting ""specifically to discuss the circuit-breaker idea"" earlier in the week - and repeated that call in a letter on Wednesday. ""I think it's an idea that will need further examination and needs to be shared in perspective between the four UK nations,"" Mark Drakeford added. Mr Johnson has rejected Mr Drakeford's demand fora travel ban on people coming to Wales from England's virus hotspots. Ministers in Northern Ireland's devolved government have been warned thatCovid-19 infection rates will keep rising if both schools and the hospitality sector remain open, the BBC has learned. The Scottish governmentis to implement its own three-tier frameworkof restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. The daily figure of 143 deaths follows 50 deaths announced on Monday and was the highest daily total since the 164 deaths recorded on 10 June. Thelatest government figures,externalalso show another 17,234 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, compared with 13,792 cases the day before. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said the rising number of deaths was ""hugely concerning"". ""We have seen cases increasing especially in older age groups which is leading to more hospital admissions. This is a stark reminder for us to follow the guidelines,"" she said. The Labour leader's call has added to the volume of demand for extra caution - marking the end of the phase of what he used to describe as constructive opposition. Sir Keir Starmer has been inching away from the broad front bench consensus on how to handle coronavirus for weeks. To the frustration of some on his own side, rather than scream down the government's plans he has developed an attack on the government's ability to handle the situation and to act quickly enough. But his call for a circuit-breaker means he believes the government has simply got it wrong. Polling suggests too that there is public desire for tougher action to prevent a terrible second wave. Some senior figures in government agree. Read more from Laura Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier defended the new measures, telling MPs that Covid-19 posed ""a formidable threat"" until a vaccine can be found. But he said the government makes ""decisions that are guided by the science, taking into account all of the different considerations"". ""Protecting our economy and protecting our health are not alternatives"", he added, but said action was required to ""protect lives and livelihoods"". Sir Keir said Labour would not vote against the measures - even though they did not go far enough. ""We are not going to vote down a package of restrictions because restrictions are needed,"" he said. A senior government source branded Sir Keir a ""shameless opportunist"", saying he was ""playing political games in the middle of a global pandemic"".

The Liverpool region will enter a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of thenew three-tier systemfor coronavirus restrictions in England. Five questions about the new lockdown system How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Most parts of England are on the lowest tier, but Essex hasasked to be moved to ""high"" level restrictions. Meanwhile,London could be put in a stricter lockdown within days,Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government examines a ""wide range of different data"" and takes advice from health experts before deciding which tier applies to an area. ""We look not only at infection rates but also the rate of positive tests, admissions to hospitals, and admissions to intensive care units,"" they said. A committee of senior government health officials have been considering putting Greater Manchester and Lancashire into the highest level of restrictions and will hold a further meeting on Wednesday. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said the government ""risks confusing people"" in the region just days after it was put in the second highest tier, adding ""unfunded restrictions are unfair"". The highest tier of restrictions are set to come into force in Liverpool on Wednesday In other developments: The UK unemployment rate has surged to its highest level in over three years as the pandemic continues to hit jobs.A ""disproportionate"" number of people affected are aged between 16 and 24 People who were told to shield to protect themselves from coronavirus earlier in the year will receive a letter with tips on how to protect themselves from infection -but will not be told to shield again at the moment The number of secondary schools in England sending home some pupils because of Covid is increasing rather than diminishing,the latest weekly figures from the Department for Education show Conservative MP Chris Green has resigned as a parliamentary private secretary -criticising the restrictions in his Bolton West and Atherton constituency,externaland saying there were ""better alternatives to the government's approach"". He wrote: ""There is a healthy debate on how we can eliminate this coronavirus or how we can live with it and this is being led by many distinguished academics, epidemiologists and other specialists. Police in Scotland have warned football fans not to cross the borderinto England this weekend in order to watch the Celtic v Rangers game in the pub The 143 new deaths reported is clearly a concern. It is the highest daily figure since early June and feels significant, even taking into account the impact of the delayed reporting at the weekend which often pushes up the figures on a Tuesday. But to understand what is happening you have to rewind a month or so and look at cases. Cases were rising rapidly then - it is what promoted the government's senior advisers to warn there could be 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. That has not happened. Just over 17,000 were announced today. The trajectory has not been as steep as it could have been. We have seen a similar pattern happen with hospital admissions. They are rising, but over the last week the rate of increase has slowed just a little. Deaths will, sadly, continue to go up in the coming days and weeks, but if the patterns seen with cases and hospital admissions are sustained those rises will slow too. It is very, very different from the rapid surge we saw in the spring. But a gradual and slow continual rise could still have a devastating impact over the long autumn and winter period. That is why we are seeing politicians and scientists argue about what is the best way to contain the virus, while limiting the impact restrictions have on wider society and the economy.
