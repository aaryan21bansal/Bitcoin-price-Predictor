"This week the British papers revelled in news about how much the BBC's on-air stars get paid, though the salaries of their counterparts in commercial TV remain under wraps. In Norway, there are no such secrets. Anyone can find out how much anyone else is paid - and it rarely causes problems. In the past, your salary was published in a book. A list of everyone's income, assets and the tax they had paid, could be found on a shelf in the public library. These days, the information is online, just a few keystrokes away. The change happened in 2001, and it had an instant impact. ""It became pure entertainment for many,"" says Tom Staavi, a former economics editor at the national daily, VG. ""At one stage you would automatically be told what your Facebook friends had earned, simply by logging on to Facebook. It was getting ridiculous."" Transparency is important, Staavi says, partly because Norwegians pay high levels of income tax  - an average of 40.2% compared to 33.3% in the UK,according to Eurostat,external, while the EU average is just 30.1%. ""When you pay that much you have to know that everyone else is doing it, and you have to know that the money goes to something reasonable,"" he says. ""We [need to] have trust and confidence in both the tax system and in the social security system."" In 2015 Norwegian PM Erna Solberg earned 1,573,544 kroner (Â£151,001). - her assets were valued at 2,054,896 kroner (Â£197,179) and she paid 677,459 kroner (Â£65,011) in taxes This is considered to far outweigh any problems that may be caused by envy. In fact, in most workplaces, people have a fairly good idea how much their colleagues are earning, without having to look it up. Wages in many sectors are set through collective agreements, and pay gaps are relatively narrow. The gender pay gap is also narrow, by international standards. The World Economic Forumranks Norway third out of 144,externalcountries in terms of wage equality for similar work. So the figures that flashed up on Facebook may not have taken many people by surprise. But at a certain point Tom Staavi and others lobbied the government to introduce measures that would encourage people to think twice before snooping on the salary details of a friend, neighbour or colleague. People now have to log in using their national ID number in order to access the data on the tax authority's website, and for the last three years it has been impossible to search anonymously. ""Since 2014 it has been possible to find out who has been doing searches on your information,"" explains Hans Christian Holte, the head of Norway's tax authority. ""We saw a significant drop to about a 10th of the volume that was before. I think it has taken out the Peeping Tom mentality."" Hans Christian Holte encourages people to report suspected tax evasion There are some three million taxpayers in Norway, out of a total population of 5.2 million. The tax authority logged 16.5 million searches in the year before restrictions were put into place. Today there are around two million searches per year. In a recent survey 92% of people said they did not look up friends, family or acquaintances. ""Earlier I did do searches, but now it's visible if you do it, so I don't do it any more,"" says a woman I meet on the streets of Oslo, Nelly Bjorge. ""I was curious about some neighbours, and also about celebrities and royalty. It could be good to know if very rich people are cheating, but you don't always know. Because they have many ways of reducing their income."" The tax lists only tell you people's net income, net assets and tax paid. Someone with a vast property portfolio, for instance, would probably be worth far more than the figure found in the lists, because the taxable property value is often far less than the current market value. Everyone has been able to see how much anyone earns and the taxes they pay, since 1814 Hege Glad, a teacher from Fredrikstad south of Oslo, remembers that when she was young, adults used to queue up to examine the ""enormous, thick"" books of income and tax data, published once a year. ""I know my father was one of those looking. When he came home he was in a bad mood because our well-to-do neighbour was listed with little income, no assets and, most of all, a very small amount of tax paid,"" she says. While she approves of Norway's transparency in this area, she notes that it can have negative effects. She has seen this in school. ""I remember once coming into school and a group of boys were very keen to tell me about the massive amounts of money the dad of one of the others in the class was making. ""I noticed a couple of other boys who usually were part of this gang had pulled back, saying little. The mood was not very nice,"" she says. There have been other stories about children from low-income families who have been bullied in school, by classmates who looked up their parents' financial situation. How much do the stars earn? What will the industry make of star pay? Reality check: the gender pay gap But Hans Christian Holte thinks the government currently has the balance about right. The fact that anonymous searches are no longer permitted discourages criminals from searching for wealthy people to target. And yet, the restrictions introduced in 2014 have not stopped whistleblowers reporting things they find suspicious. ""We like people to do searches which could help us in investigating tax evasion and the amount of tips that we get has not gone down,"" he says. ""Maybe the Peeping Tom part has more or less vanished, but you still have the legitimate reasons for searching and also some good effects of that openness.""

"Jodie Whittaker will take the title role in Doctor Who but Helen Mirren was star of Prime Suspect back in 2006 In the week the BBC announced it was casting a woman as Doctor Who for the first time, it also revealed that only a third of its highest-paid stars are women. Headlines about women's equality, or otherwise, in British TV abounded. It got the Reality Check team thinking about whether Jodie Whittaker's appointment as the first female Doctor was a sign of changing times, or is news from the BBC's payroll a more accurate barometer of female fortunes in entertainment? In essence: are more women getting lead roles in TV dramas? According to our research, the answer seems to be: hardly. There is a rise compared with a decade ago - but the increase is marginal. The number of females in lead television roles rose by only one - from 17 in 2006 to 18 in 2016 - although when the number of females enjoying shared lead roles is taken into account, the difference is slightly greater - 26 against 21. Reality Check has looked at the 50 most-watched dramas (excluding soaps) in the UK for 2016, and the corresponding top 50 a decade earlier. To compile each list we've used the official consolidated TV viewing figures collected and published by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB). In 2006, the top 50 most-watched TV dramas included literary adaptations, like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, starring Geraldine McEwan, and Philip Pullman's The Ruby In The Smoke, featuring Billie Piper in a lead role. There were popular original series, too. Ten years ago crime drama Blue Murder, starring Caroline Quentin as detective and single mother Janine Lewis, was in its third series on ITV. And attracting more than five million viewers was The Kindness of Strangers, a psychological drama with Julie Graham and Hermione Norris. The top 10 for 2006 featured two female-led shows with an audience of more than eight million: Housewife, 49, based on the wartime diaries of Nella Last and starring Victoria Wood, and Helen Mirren's final appearances as Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect 7: The Final Act. Prime Suspect, of course, was instrumental in leading the way for strong female leads on TV. Lewis and A Touch of Frost were among the most viewed dramas with a male lead. Michelle Keegan in Our Girl On the list in 2016 was the second series of military drama Our Girl, starring Michelle Keegan, as was Dark Angel, a chilling story set in the 19th century starring Joanne Froggatt as prolific serial killer Mary Anne Cotton. In terms of overall popularity, three of the five dramas that proved most popular with audiences in 2016 featured a lead character or characters who were female. Forensic crime drama Silent Witness, starring Emilia Fox, was in its 19th series and still attracting audiences in excess of eight million. Happy Valley, for which Sarah Lancashire won a Best Actress TV Bafta, was in its second run, and there was Call The Midwife, with its female ensemble cast. Popular shows with a male lead included Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock and Death In Paradise, starring Kris Marshall. Some caveats - streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime don't release their viewing figures. That means that undoubtedly popular shows with strong female leads, like The Crown, Orange Is the New Black and The Gilmore Girls revival, could not be included on the 2016 top-50 list. And of course major streaming services did not exist back in 2006. So in conclusion, the number of female-led dramas - and the ones in which women share the lead - have slightly increased, along with their popularity with audiences. But there's a long way to go before parity is achieved.

"Was OJ Simpson's arrest and trial the beginning of reality TV - and Donald Trump's rise? It seems entirely fitting that OJ Simpson should reappear at this surreal juncture in American life because many of the trends that culminated in the election of Donald J Trump can be traced back to his arrest and trial. Consider first of all the impact on the US media of that slow-motion car chase, as ""The Juice"" headed down the 405 freeway in the back of his white Ford Bronco pursued by a small armada of police cars and a squadron of news helicopters. With viewers glued to their televisions Â­that day, Domino's recorded a record spike in pizza deliveries. It was the moment arguably that real-time, rolling news truly came of age. That chase and the gavel-to-gavel coverage of the 1995 trial on CNN and Court TV demonstrated a voracious appetite for cable news. The OJ ""trial of the century"", with its blend of tabloid sensationalism and serious analysis, established the formula for ratings success. In last year's presidential election, the media fixation with Donald Trump demonstrated how that recipe still works now. His candidacy could almost have been tailor made to fit the requirements of real-time cable news and Twitter, its digital equivalent. In ratings terms, his road to the White House became the political equivalent of that freeway chase, an improbable journey we couldn't take our eyes off partly because we were fascinated to learn how it would end. Donald Trump exploited this. The billionaire reality TV star, sensing immediately his media pulling power, became the ringmaster of an OJ-style circus. OJ Simpson was already a star, but the whole of America was hooked on every detail of the trial America's celebrity culture predates OJ Simpson, but his trial unquestionably fuelled it. Johnny Cochran, Marcia Clark, Robert Shapiro. The attorneys became stars in their own right. So, too, did Judge Lance Ito. Kato Kaelin, a minor player, parlayed his witness stand limelight into various appearances on reality TV shows. Then there's the Kardashian connection. OJ's close friend Robert Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Kim, Chloe and Rob, sat alongside the defence team throughout the trial. Read more: The spectacular fall of 'The Juice' Trump and his reality TV strategy OJ trials: Where are they now? The first time that Americans were introduced to a Kardashian on television was when Robert appeared before the media on 17 June, 1994, the day of the Bronco car chase, to read a letter penned by OJ which sounded like a confession. Robert Kardashian became one of the first inadvertent celebrities of the OJ story, and his children ended up being beneficiaries. This video can not be played OJ Simpson: A life in court Few episodes in American life so starkly exposed the racial divide as the OJ verdict. A majority of whites were convinced of his guilt. Polls suggested that six out of 10 African-Americans thought him innocent. In the Oscar-winning documentary OJ: Made in America, one of the most stunning sequences comes when the shots of jubilant African-Americans celebrating OJ's acquittal are juxtaposed with white viewers speechless and stunned. Such was the roar of delight from OJ's supporters gathered outside the courthouse that a police horse reared up in fright. Back then it was stunning to see how Americans presented with the same evidence could reach conclusions so diametrically opposed. But it was not altogether surprising. In the aftermath of the Rodney King beating, and the acquittal of the officers who clubbed him so mercilessly, it made sense for the defence team to put the Los Angeles Police Department on trial. Playing what became known as ""the race card"" was a clever, if cynical ploy (OJ's lawyer Robert Shapiro famously said afterwards his legal team had played the race card from ""the bottom of the pack""). After the celebrated former football star had been acquitted, one of the nine African-Americans on the jury was brazen enough to flash OJ Simpson the black power salute. Another black juror, Carrie Bess, unashamedly told the makers of OJ: Made in America the verdict was payback for Rodney King. Americans reached radically different conclusions in 1995, as they do now The black lawyer Johnny Cochran had successfully tapped into a shared sense of victimhood among African-Americans understandably appalled by the institutional racism of the LAPD. Mark Fuhrman, the detective who was recorded using a racial epithet, became exhibit one, the perfect bogey man. Here again there are parallels with the election of Donald Trump, when voters were presented with the same evidence, the same televised spectacle, and reached diametrically opposed opinions. Again America was riven, although the roots of that polarisation were different. With OJ, it was race. Read more: The two faces of Trump's America Did our brains evolve to foolishly follow celebrities? With Trump, it was class, education, gender and geography. Yet he, too, tapped into a shared sense of victimhood. He portrayed himself as the victim of the Washington political establishment and East Coast liberal media, essentially telling his supporters that the same elites sneering at him were the same elites sneering at them. Whereas Cochran played the race card, Trump deployed the rage card. Another parallel. When historians study the rise of post-truth politics, the triumph of feelings over fact, they will surely trace at least some of its origins back to the OJ Simpson trial. In that LA County courtroom, the evidence overwhelmingly pointed towards Simpson's guilt on charges of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson Brown, and her friend, Ron Goldman. Yet some jury members admitted afterwards they wanted to give the LAPD and the prosecution team a bloody nose. For some jurors, it was a protest verdict, based on emotion rather than the facts of the case. Donald Trump starred in The Apprentice What struck me about last year's election was how many voters were prepared to overlook Donald Trump's truth-stretching and falsehoods because of their determination to exact revenge and send a message. Trump's relied on slogans - Make America Great Again, Build the Wall, Lock Her Up - Â­knowing they had more resonance than detailed policies. Feelings were more important than facts. Hillary Clinton became the perfect bogey woman. Someone who personified all that was wrong with the American body politic. Someone who used the ""d"" word, deplorables, to describe them. Many of those who voted for Trump felt the political system was rigged against the white working class, just as some of the black jurors in the OJ trial felt the political system was rigged against them. This video can not be played Four things OJ did in while in prison Johnny Cochran proved a master at presenting alternative facts, even coming up with the simple, but deeply misleading, catch-phrase, ""if it doesn't fit you must acquit"". Donald Trump has become the greatest practitioner of post-truth politics, and cries ""fake media"" in much the same way that Cochran talked of fake forensic evidence. During his first six months in office, the President made 836 false statements, according to the fact-checkers at the Washington Post, but that doesn't seem to worry staunch Trump loyalists. Back in 1995 the world was captivated by the trial of OJ Simpson, just as it now is with the trials and tribulations of Donald Trump. To outsiders, both are Only in America phenomena. When the not guilty verdict was handed down, many global onlookers found it completely inexplicable, and concluded there must be something terribly wrong with America's criminal justice system. Is that now not the question being asked of America's broken politics? OJ Simpson to be freed from prison Trump and his reality TV strategy OJ Simpson: A life in court.

"This video can not be played Should people with a mental illness be helped to die? A year ago, Canada legalised medically assisted suicide for terminally ill people approaching death. But one man's activism has forced Canada to ask difficult and controversial questions about the limits on an individual's right to die. In the basement of his father's home in Windsor, Ontario, Adam Maier-Clayton lays out orange prescription bottles full of pills. They contain just some of the medication that doctors have given him to treat his mental health condition. In a video posted on YouTube, he lists the anti-depressants, mood stabilisers and tranquilisers he's taken, as well as ""lots and lots of therapy"". Adam's mental health problems first emerged in childhood. He suffered from obsessive thoughts, depression and anxiety. Later, as a talented soccer player and prolific goal scorer, he'd bind his fingers with tape to try to stop his physical tics from distracting him from his game. But after experimenting with cannabis for the first time at the age of 23, Adam's symptoms worsened significantly. ""Man, it knocked him right off his tracks,"" his father Graham told me. Adam Maier-Clayton campaigned for expanding the limits of assisted dying legislation ""He was in and out of hospital for six or seven days. He suffered depersonalisation, a kind of 'other worldliness.' Doctors thought it was just a temporary effect of the drug - but it brought about a permanent change in him and things started to go downhill from there on."" Adam began experiencing crippling physical pain throughout his body. He described the experience as akin to being ""burned with acid"". Any kind of cognitive activity, such as reading, writing or even talking for more than a short time, made the pain worse and left him incapacitated for hours afterwards. He was diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Disorder, a psychiatric condition characterised by physical complaints that aren't faked but can't always be traced to a known medical illness. In June 2016, as Adam's bouts of pain were becoming ever more frequent and debilitating, Canada's federal parliament passed a landmark piece of legislation. Adam Maier-Clayton and his father, Graham Clayton The law is called Bill C-14. It legalises physician-assisted suicide, provided certain strict criteria are met. ""C-14 allows people who are broadly conceived to be at the end of life, who are 18 years old or older, who suffer from a serious disease or disability, who have irreversible decline in capabilities and who suffer unbearably to obtain medical assistance in dying - basically a doctor or a nurse who will be able to end their lives,"" explains Trudo Lemmens, Professor of Health Law and Policy at the University of Toronto. The boundaries permitting assisted suicide under Bill C-14 are deliberately narrow in scope - and exclude people suffering solely from a mental illness who aren't also grievously and terminally ill. Adam Maier-Clayton believed the law was ambiguous, unconstitutional and discriminatory. Convinced his condition was untreatable, he began a vocal campaign of media activism, arguing that Canada should follow the example of Belgium and the Netherlands. In those countries, people who believe their lives have become intolerable because of severe mental illness can seek permission to receive lethal drugs with a doctor or nurse's help. ""Every Canadian deserves this right, the right to have the ability to terminate pain that is chronic, incurable,"" he told the Canadian Press in September last year. Adam Maier-Clayton was diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Disorder But in cases of psychiatric illness, critics say, determining whether a person's condition is chronic and incurable isn't clear-cut. ""If we provide adequate mental healthcare, the majority of people will recover in a way that provides them with quality of life,"" argues Professor Lemmens. ""Yes, some people people will continue to suffer. Yes, some people will likely commit suicide - but at the outset we don't know who are the people who will not recover. That's very hard to determine."" Dr Michael Bach agrees. He's executive director of IRIS, a Toronto-based institute that works to improve the rights of people with disabilities. He's not totally opposed to euthanasia, but fears a creeping inevitability should the criteria for assisted suicide be widened. Once assisted suicide is made available to people with mental health problems, he says, more and more people are likely to be drawn to it before all their treatment options have been exhausted. ""To suggest that we can remediate suffering by terminating a life is a very strange logic,"" Dr Bach told me. ""We need to be careful not to provide an 'out' to tough situations. ""I don't want to say that we shouldn't do everything we can to minimise personal suffering. But we can't expect of medicine that we're going to eradicate suffering from life. Somehow that has emerged as the social and medical and political project."" The Supreme Court weighed in on medically-assisted suicide in 2015 Pro-euthanasia campaigners in Canada argue otherwise. They point to a Supreme Court decision from 2015 in the case of Carter v Canada, which they say makes no reference to terminal illness as one of the core criteria for a medically assisted death. ""The Supreme Court justices in that decision could have at any time put 'terminal illness' or 'imminently dying' as part of the decision - they did not,"" says Shanaaz Gokool, chief executive of Dying with Dignity Canada. ""What they looked at was the person, and the level and degree of suffering that they may have, that may be physical or psychological or psychiatric in nature. ""And so from that decision our Supreme Court justices said that, yes, there is a role here to ensure that people who have grievous and irremediable medical conditions, that cause them enduring and intolerable suffering for which there is no remedy acceptable to the person as long as they're an adult and they're clearly consenting, should be able to have an assisted death,"" Gokool says. Medically assisted dying for people with mental health problems is currently the subject of one of three reviews being carried out by the Council of Canadian Academies. A report is due before the end of next year, although its findings will be advisory and not binding on any future changes to legislation by Ottawa's lawmakers. The review, though, will come too late for Adam Maier-Clayton. On April 13th he drove to a motel just off Highway 401, ate breakfast, and then took his own life. Adam Maier-Clayton excelled at soccer He was 27. In his final Facebook post he wrote: ""I am my own saviour. Always have been. Always will be."" Following his death, Graham Clayton plans to continue his son's activism by campaigning for an extension of Canada's assisted suicide laws to include people with enduring mental illnesses. ""Adam didn't believe in suicide. He believed in suicide prevention,"" Mr Clayton told me. ""For the overwhelming majority of people there's hope. The research has been done. The medical treatment is there. If they have to go through a variety of different treatments and drug therapies to find what works, fine. Hang in there and stay the course. ""But when you know that you're in such a dire situation and the science hasn't been done it should be your call when you've had enough. ""If you're so inclined you should be able to ask for help - help in ending the pain."" If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact at BBC Advice.

"Comic-Con International is now a major event and has spawned festivals around the world San Diego's Comic-Con International, happening this weekend, is an annual fiesta of costumes, comic books and celebrities that sits at the centre of a multi-billion dollar industry. From a gathering of less than 300 people in 1970, the event has morphed into an annual, multi-day media bonanza that draws major corporate sponsors, movie studios and more than 150,000 people. The event made more than $17m in revenue in 2015, according to themost recent tax filing,externalavailable online, and it has spawned similar festivals in cities around the world. ""San Diego's growth has been mind-boggling,"" says author John Jackson Miller, who also owns Comichron, which tracks sales of comic books. Mr Miller went to San Diego for the first time in the early 1990s, when it still drew less than 40,000 people. When Comic-Con started just 300 came, now it involves more than 150,000 people Now thousands of people flock to San Diego for the event even without tickets and the skyrocketing demand has led some to call for San Diego to expand its convention centre. Eventbrite, a ticketing website, estimated that fandom conventions in North America grossed $600m in 2013. It said the wider economic impact could be as high as $5bn. The San Diego convention centreestimates,externalthe annual July event generates some $140m in economic impact for the region. Experts say the growth has been fuelled in part by a Hollywood that has mined comic books and science fiction for blockbusters, broadening the fan base. What happened on the first day of Comic-Con 2017? What we learned from The Walking Dead season 8 trailer Did Halle Berry really drink half a pint of whiskey at the Kingsman 2 panel? Advances in special effects since 2000, when X-Men was released, have increased the success of movie adaptations, says Mr Miller. (Warner Bros. and Disney own the two major comic publishing outfits.) The event's also been helped by higher consumer spending on live entertainment The popularity of the events also coincides with a rise in spending on live entertainment, particularly among younger customers. Some of the shift reflects a wealthier society with money to burn beyond basic needs, says Stephanie Tully, a marketing professor at University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, who has researched consumer spending. But she says there's an additional factor at play: Fear Of Missing Out - a phenomenon popularly dubbed FOMO - which has been exacerbated by social media. ""It's really difficult to substitute this year's comic con with next year's comic con,"" says Eesha Sharma, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who worked with Ms Tully on a newstudy,externalthat shows people are more likely to go into debt to pay for experiences than material goods. Companies have taken note of the phenomenon. In an increasingly online world, there's still no substitute for face-to-face interactions Disney is investing heavily in its theme parks and big investors such as TPG Capital, a private equity giant, have plunged money into troupes such as Cirque du Soleil. ""What I hear and what I see is that companies ... have a huge interest in live entertainment at the moment,"" says John Maatta, a former television executive who is now chief at Wizard World, which ran comic conventions in more than a dozen US cities last year. Mr Maatta says he thinks people put more value on real-world interaction as more of our lives play out online. ""There's no substitute for human connection,"" he says. The growing circus at the San Diego festival, which unlike many others is run by a not-for-profit operation, has turned off some industry stalwarts. Film adaptations have boosted the appeal of events like Comic-Con Earlier this month, Mile High Comics, a major comics retailer, said it would not attend for the first time in more than 40 years. Other long time participants have started their own events. David Glanzer, a spokesman for Comic-Con International: San Diego, did not respond to questions about its approach. The group in 2014 filed a lawsuit against a smaller Salt Lake City event, alleging that the group had violated its trademark. But for the most part, organizers have appeared content to let the fandom multiply. ReedPOP, part of a London-based company, started the New York Comic Con in 2006 - it's expected to draw some 200,000 people this year - and now runs about 30 events globally in cities that include Shanghai, Mumbai and Sydney. Cosplayers at the 2015 MCM Comic Con in Manchester England Event director Mike Armstrong says there's some room to grow in the US, and even more opportunity overseas. ""I'm very much of the mindset that rising waters will lift all ships,"" says Mr Armstrong. ""I view smaller shows as feeder opportunities to get people excited and interested so they might one day want to attend New York Comic Con."" Earlier this year, Wizard World, which has scaled back the number of shows since 2015, warned investors it may not be able to continue in business. But Mr Maatta said the problem was temporary and didn't reflect the bigger market. The firm has righted itself with new financing and announcements of additional conventions are coming, he says. Comic book sales were flat last year but for now the industry is healthy ""The plan is just to intensify what we're doing,"" he says. Are there clouds on the horizon? Robert Salkowitz, the author of Comic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture, has followed the comic industry's rise since the 1990s. ""I always have my eye on how it could fall apart,"" he says. Sales at comic book shops were flat in 2016 and have slipped this year,according to Comichron,external. Comic book fandom: No longer a fad, for many it's a lifestyle But Mr Marshall said that compares to banner performance in prior years. Comic sales at general audience book stores continue to grow and movies, such as Wonder Woman, still rake in millions at the box office. A few flops might scare off the industry, but for now Mr Salkowitz says he thinks the market is healthy. ""Fandom has grown big enough,"" he says.

"Drag queens wear striking costumes in Berlin's gay street festival Gay Pride Berlin is a riot of glitter, glam and rainbow flags. This weekend people will celebrate Germany's new law to allow equal marriage. But it is not necessarily ""equal"" for gay parents. Berlin drag kings wax their moustaches, the queens dust off their biggest beehives and huge rainbow flags adorn government ministries. This year Berlin's gay festival season has an unusually political edge. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier signed the new equal marriage law on Thursday, meaning that same-sex couples should be able to get married from October. Until now only civil partnerships were available, which lacked some rights. Justice Minister Heiko Maas tweeted: ""A great day for more justice. Finally all get the same rights!"" JÃ¶rg Hormann and his husband Patrick have been in a civil partnership for 9.5 years and have two young children. ""We hope that now, finally, people will know that we are a completely normal family,"" said JÃ¶rg. ""We're just happy that we're no longer seen as inferior."" I met JÃ¶rg and his family a few weeks ago at a demonstration outside the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house, as lawmakers formally voted on the measure. Next to him stood a woman holding a placard saying ""scrap homophobic adoption law"". Journalists looked confused. ""But I thought the new law sorts out adoption for gay people?"" one asked her. JÃ¶rg (L) and Patrick have two children and welcome the new law In fact Germany's new equal marriage act allows gay couples to adopt. But it ignores the precarious situation of lesbian couples where one partner has a child. ""German laws have, until now, focused on bloodline,"" explained Constanze KÃ¶rner from the LSVD, a gay rights group. It means that traditionally in Germany the legal definition of two parents is a mother and a father. In heterosexual relationships, a man becomes the legal father by marrying the mother, or by simply recognising fatherhood. For non-biological parents in same-sex relationships, however, the only possibility is a difficult and bureaucratic formal adoption procedure. It is a process which some mothers describe as harrowing and intrusive, with gay parents having to justify their parenting to officials. It can take up to 18 months, so it can also be a period of uncertainty, a legal limbo in which the co-parent has no parental rights and the child is potentially vulnerable if the biological mother dies. ""We definitely need the possibility that things can be regulated legally before conception, whether there's a known father, or whether the child was conceived through a sperm bank, so that families and children are legally protected,"" said Ms KÃ¶rner. Berlin festival: One reveller posed as Donald Trump looking like a drag queen The new equal marriage law took Germany by surprise. For years the issue had been blocked by Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), many of whom define marriage as between a man and a woman. But attitudes in Germany have been shifting and, with elections coming in September, Mrs Merkel's rivals, the centre-left SPD, were hoping to turn gay marriage into a campaign issue. In typical Merkel fashion, she outmanoeuvred them. She allowed parliament to vote on it, and for it to be a vote of conscience, knowing that this would guarantee the law passed. But she kept her conservative party base happy by voting no. ""Merkel's the only person in parliament who did not vote according to her conscience,"" one observer joked. German MPs approve gay marriage 'My brother can marry his boyfriend' Catholic Malta embraces gay marriage The SPD is still keen to use the issue in the election, Berlin's SPD mayor Michael MÃ¼ller told me. ""We managed to push this through against the will of the CDU. How Merkel behaved baffled many people. It's clear that it was a pure election tactic, and voters always take such things badly."" Not according to some of those at the annual Lesbian and Gay Festival near Nollendorfplatz last weekend. For Larissa (in dark glasses) and her friends the new law was cause for celebration Larissa has just got engaged to her girlfriend, and although she is not a Merkel fan, she is just happy that she can now get married. ""Merkel was the one who enabled this to be a vote of conscience. She has her opinion, and I can tolerate that. But she still allowed it to happen, so for me that's a positive thing."" Do one thing, while simultaneously also doing the exact opposite - that is often how Chancellor Merkel operates. And on equal marriage she has wriggled out of a potentially explosive election issue. But for many gay parents the fight continues.

"Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, who has died aged 41, changed the dynamics of nu metal with his searingly personal lyrics and musical curiosity. Linkin Park weren't the first band to fuse metal and rap, but they were the most successful. Their first album, Hybrid Theory, was certified diamond in the US, representing 10 million sales. Around the world, they sold more than 50 million records. What set them apart from other nu metal acts like Korn and Limp Bizkit was the vocal interplay between its two frontmen. Linkin Park's Chester Bennington dies Reaction to Chester Bennington's death on Music News LIVE In pictures:  Rocker Chester Bennington remembered Chester Bennington: The music world reacts Linkin Park star's hurt made moving music Chester Bennington's guttural screams tussled with Mike Shinoda's matter-of-fact rapping in a volatile expression of rage and frustration, while DJ Joseph Hahn framed the band's thrashing guitars with sampled dystopian soundscapes. Musically, they were miles apart from the sense-dulling artlessness of many of their contemporaries, inspired by contemporary Asia, postmodernism and sample culture. They weren't afraid to show their vulnerability on songs likeNumb,externalandIn The End.,external Linkin Park released a collaborative EP with Jay-Z, and invited grime star Stormzy onto their latest album, One More Light - a brave, if not entirely successful, venture into mainstream pop. They never swore on record until 2007's Minutes to Midnight (something which boosted their commercial ascent); their lyrics were vivid enough without curse words. ""There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface / Consuming, confusing / This lack of self-control I fear is never ending,"" he sang onCrawling,external, a single from their debut album. ""I tried so hard and got so far,"" he sang on their biggest hit, In The End, ""but in the end, it doesn't even matter."" Bennington was candid about the dark times that inspired these songs - he was molested as a child, and later struggled with drug and alcohol problems. ""I literally hated life,"" he told Rock Sound in 2015. ""I was like, 'I don't want to have feelings. I want to be a sociopath. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to care what other people feel like. I want to feel nothing.'"" As a result, Bennington often sang as if he was fighting for his life and, sometimes, it felt like he was winning. ""Every scar is a story I can tell,"" he sang onSharp Edges,external, released earlier this year. In retrospect, it's tempting (and easy) to find hints of suicidal thoughts in Bennington's lyrics - but that detracts from the complexity of his writing, which could be fragile and empathetic as often as it was angst-ridden. Outside of music, he tried to be a force for positivity, too - setting up the fund Music for Relief with the rest of Linkin Park, and playing a range of concerts to raise money for victims of disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 tsunami. On their latest album, the band teamed up with a charity installing solar panels in communities without electricity in Africa, Haiti and Jordan. The lyrics to thetitle track,external, too, saw Bennington reach out to fans suffering depression like his own: ""If they say / Who cares if one more light goes out? / Well I do.""

"Wirapol Sukphol was seen flying in a private aircraft in a YouTube video released in 2013 It was a jarring image; a group of Buddhist monks, with shaven heads and orange robes, sitting back in the soft-leather seats of an executive jet, passing luxury accessories among themselves. The video of the monk, now known by his pre-monk name, Wirapol Sukphol, went viral after being posted on YouTube in 2013. A subsequent investigation by the Thai Department of Special Investigations (DSI) uncovered a lifestyle of what appeared to bemind-blowing decadence. They tracked down at least 200 million Thai baht ($6m; Â£4.6m) in ten bank accounts, and the purchase of 22 Mercedes Benz cars. Wirapol had built a mansion in southern California, owned a large and gaudily-decorated house in his home town of Ubon Ratchathani, and had also constructed a giant replica of the famous Emerald Buddha statue in Bangkok's royal palace, which he claimed - falsely, as it turned out - contained nine tonnes of gold. There was evidence, too, the DSI said, of sexual relationships with a number of women. One woman claimed he had fathered a child with her when she was only 15 years old, a claim the DSI says is supported by DNA analysis. Wirapol fled to the US. It took four years for the Thai authorities to secure his extradition. He has denied criminal charges of fraud, money laundering and rape. How had a monk acquired so much influence, even in his early twenties? How was he allowed to behave in ways which clearly violate the patimokkha (the 227 precepts by which monks are supposed to live)? Monks are not even supposed to touch money, and sex is strictly off-limits. Monks behaving badly are nothing new in Thailand. The temptations of modern life have thrown up many examples of monks with unseemly wealth, monks taking drugs, dancing, enjoying sexual relations with men and women or abusing girls and boys. There are also temples which have attracted large and dedicated followings, through skilful promotion of charismatic monks and abbots, said to have supernatural powers. These have capitalised on two aspects of modern Thai life; the yearning for spiritual succour among urban Thais, who no longer have a close relationship with a traditional village temple, and a belief that donating generously to powerful temples will bring success and more material wealth. It appears Wirapol tapped into this trend. He arrived in the poor North Eastern province of Sisaket in the early 2000s, establishing a monastery on donated land in the village of Ban Yang. But according to the sub-district head, Ittipol Nontha, few local people went to his temple, because they were too poor to offer the kind of donations he expected. Wirapol was questioned as part of an investigation by the DSI The monk started holding elaborate ceremonies, he said, selling amulets, and built his replica of the Emerald Buddha, to attract wealthier devotees from other parts of the country. These followers have described being beguiled by his soft, warm voice, and convinced by his claim to have powers - like the ability to walk on water and talk to deities. In turn, Wirapol gave generously to those with influence in the province; many of the cars he bought were gifts for important monks and officials. Even today he still has supporters, who argue he is at heart a good man, entitled to enjoy donated luxuries. After a succession of scandals, people are openly talking about a crisis of Buddhism in Thailand. Numbers of ordained monks have been falling steeply in recent years, and many smaller village temples are unable to support themselves financially. The body which is supposed to govern the Buddhist clergy is the Supreme Sangha Council, but this comprises a group of very elderly monks, and until this year had not had a properly functioning Supreme Patriarch for more than a decade. It has proved ineffective. The National Office of Buddhism is also supposed to regulate the religion, but it too has been plagued by leadership turmoil and allegations of financial irregularities. Curious case of a hidden abbot and a besieged temple In pictures: Thai monks clash with police The government has now introduced a law requiring temples, which collectively accumulate $3-4bn (Â£2-3bn) in donations every year, to publicise their financial records. It is also talking about introducing a new, digital ID card for monks to ensure those tainted by malpractice cannot be ordained again. The faltering morality of monks, though, is partly rooted in the way Buddhism has evolved in Thailand. For 150 years there have been two quite different forms of Buddhism; that of the more austere, Thammayut tradition, practised in the elite, palace-backed temples of Bangkok, which upholds the strict rules about monks detaching themselves from the material world; and the looser Mahanikai tradition of the provinces, where monks are part of the community, joining neighbourhood activities, sometimes in violation of the patimokkhai. In the villages, temples have served as schools or traditional centres of medicine and venues for local celebrations. The advice of monks has been sought on a range of worldly issues; in this environment the line between what is and is not acceptable behaviour can become blurred. The other source of the problem is the hold that superstition has over many Thais, and the way this has become commercialised. Monks are these days often used more as deliverers of semi-religious rituals - like blessing new cars or houses for good luck - than practitioners of the 227 precepts. No-one in Thailand bats an eyelid at the sight of lottery tickets being sold inside temples. Buddhist monks are not supposed to touch money, and sex is strictly off-limits This love of superstition extends to rich Thais, who are happy to donate generously in the belief this will ensure greater fortune in the future. Phra Payom Kalayano, the abbot of a temple north of Bangkok well known for his criticism of the commercialisation of Buddhism, has appealed to Thais to be more thoughtful about donating. ""Nowadays people think good karma is about throwing money at temples - especially rich people. They have faith, but they don't think. That is not practising good karma, smartly. That is just blind faith. ""At the same time, some monks are stupid. They don't know how to manage the donations they receive. Instead of managing the money to build karma and prestige for the temple, the monks end up building criminal cases against themselves,"" he said. In a simpler age, before the arrival of globalisation and its many consumer distractions, it was easier to advocate a monastic life that disavows all material pleasures. But it is harder today to insist that monks should forego technological conveniences like smartphones and air travel. It is even harder to define what role monks should play in 21st Century Thailand, beyond the provision of services like amulets and good luck blessings, which can so easily turn into a money-making business.

"This video can not be played They were the largest crowds. Period. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has quit, reportedly in protest at an organisational shake-up. Mr Spicer stepped down because he was unhappy with President Donald Trump's appointment of a new communications director, according to reports. Combative Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci has been picked for the role that Mr Spicer partially filled. Mr Spicer's press briefings were a cable news hit, but in recent weeks he withdrew from the camera's glare. He told US media that the White House ""could benefit from a clean slate"". Later, appearing on Fox News, Mr Spicer said that with Mr Scaramucci's appointment there was a risk of ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" in the White House media operation, which was why he was stepping down. The 45 year old said he had told Mr Trump he ""would stay on for a few weeks to achieve a smooth transition"", and was looking forward to spending more time with his family. He defended the president's agenda and hit out at what he termed ""media bias"", saying: ""I was increasingly disappointed about the way the media here do their job, or don't do their job."" Who is 'The Mooch'? My six hectic months with Sean Spicer 10 surprising things Trump just said The shake-up at the White House comes amid several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US presidential election and whether Mr Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake"". inflating crowd size estimates at Trump inauguration at first briefing his appearance, particularly his suits, reportedly criticised by Trump saying Hitler never used chemical weapons and referring to Holocaust ""centres"" butt of text message joke by adviser Steve Bannon about his weight defending Trump ""covfefe"" tweet by saying it had hidden meaning frozen out of meeting with the Pope in Rome, despite being devout Catholic not invited to Paris for Trump visit Announcing that he would step down next month, Mr Spicer tweeted that it had been ""an honor & a privilege to serve"" the president. The BBC's White House reporter Tara McKelvey says journalists besieged the 18-acre complex so they could film Mr Spicer leaving. In an assured debut, he attended Friday afternoon's news conference to announce that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, formerly Mr Spicer's deputy, would step into his shoes. ""I love the president and it's an honour to be here,"" Mr Scaramucci said, adding: ""He is genuinely a wonderful human being."" He also said: ""The president has really good karma."" Mr Scaramucci, who has no previous experience in communications roles, paid tribute to Mr Spicer as ""a true American patriot"" and ""incredibly gracious"". ""I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he said. This video can not be played It's his first day, and he has to say sorry to the boss Mr Scaramucci also apologised and said he had been ""unexperienced"" as he explained his previous criticism of the president. In an August 2015 interview with Fox Business, he dismissed Mr Trump as a ""hack"" and ""an inherited money dude"" with ""a big mouth"". Mr Scaramucci is currently senior vice-president of the Export-Import Bank, a US government agency which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of American exports. A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January thatElton John would playat the new president's inauguration. The singer promptly denied it. Life on a White House staff is intense and exhausting. This administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show. Sean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date. It could also be a sign of bigger tremors to come. Mr Spicer was closely allied with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was his boss last year in the Republican National Committee. The Trump team has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear. Leaks abound. The prestige and power of advisers and aides wax and wane. Media reports abound of a White House under siege. And just a reminder - the Trump presidency is only six months old. Ms Huckabee Sanders read a statement from President Trump, saying: ""I am grateful for Sean's work on behalf of my administration and the American people. ""I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look as his great television ratings."" On day one in January, Mr Spicer set the tone of his relationship with the press by bursting into the briefing room to berate journalists for their reporting of crowd numbers at President Trump's inauguration. His proclivity for gaffes and garbling of his words, as well as making debatable assertions, soon made Mr Spicer a household name. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was named on Friday as the new White House press secretary But he could also be charming and was liked by many among the press corps. Mr Spicer was lampooned on topical comedy show Saturday Night Live, where Melissa McCarthy played him as a loud-mouthed bully who brandished his lectern at reporters. Mr Trump noted approvingly in April that Mr Spicer ""gets great ratings"". A month later, the president said: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up."" Mr Spicer was roundly mocked after he reportedly hid by a hedgerow on the White House grounds to avoid reporters on the night Mr Trump fired the FBI director in May. His last on-camera briefing was on 20 June, and there have been few since then. Members of the media have accused the Trump administration of attempting to kill off the daily news conferences to avoid scrutiny.

"Police began searching a Cambridge landfill site for Corrie Mckeague in March An airman who disappeared 10 months ago was ""known to sleep in rubbish on a night out"", police have said. Corrie Mckeague, 23, has not been seen since a night out in Bury St Edmunds last September, when CCTV showed him entering a bin loading bay. Suffolk Police has confirmed its search of waste at Milton landfill was at an end. Mr Mckeague's family say they are ""devastated"" at the news and disputed claims he would have slept in a bin. Live updates: Reaction following Corrie Mckeague press conference The tortuous search for Corrie Mckeague This video can not be played Det Supt Katie Elliott, of Suffolk Police, spoke at a press conference in Martlesham, near Ipswich. Police said all the information ""points to the fact Corrie was transported to the landfill"". Det Supt Katie Elliott said the landfill search for Mr Mckeague had been ""systematic, comprehensive and thorough"". She said: ""Corrie had been known to go to sleep in rubbish on a night out. There is no evidence to support any other explanation at this time."" Corrie Mckeague's girlfriend April Oliver (centre) announced the birth of their baby daughter on Father's Day Responding to the news, Corrie's father Martin Mckeague posted a statement on his Facebook page saying: ""The McKeague family in Scotland is devastated by today's announcement. ""At no point did we think that the search of the site would end this way, and as all the evidence tells us that Corrie is somewhere in that landfill site, we are heartbroken at the thought that we may not be able to bring Corrie home together."" His mother Nicola Urquhart said: ""I have tried really to put my trust in them (the police) but to say I am devastated that they are now saying they think he is still in there but they are going to stop searching, I cannot begin to explain how that makes me feel."" She said she did not believe there was evidence he slept in bins and was ""angry"" at the claim. This video can not be played Corrie Mckeague: RAF airman's movements in Bury St Edmunds Det Supt Elliott said police had spoken to one witness who had previously found Mr Mckeague asleep in a bin and he had been known to previously sleep on park benches, in toilets and stair wells. Although material from the time and place of Mr Mckeague's disappearance has been found at the landfill, the serviceman, from Dunfermline, Fife, has not been discovered. In June, Mr Mckeague's girlfriend April Oliver, from Norfolk, gave birth to their daughter. The police investigation had established early on that Mr Mckeague's mobile phone tracked the same route, and at the same pace, as a bin lorry on the night of his disappearance. But initial inquiries found the rubbish truck was carrying a load of 11kg (1st 10lb), suggesting Mr Mckeague was not on the refuse truck. Then in March it emerged the true weight of the truck contents was more than 100kg (15st 10lb). The error was a ""genuine mistake"", Suffolk Police said. This video can not be played Corrie Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, spoke of her anguish as the search for the airman was ended Corrie's mother, Nicola Urquhart, said the initial assurance from police that he was not in the bin lorry had been ""the one thing that was giving me hope that he was still alive"". Police say they will now search previously incinerated waste and carry out a review of the investigation for any fresh leads in the case.

"Results of Charlie's scan were heard in court before his parents had been informed privately Charlie Gard's parents reacted angrily in court when medical information was revealed about their son which they had not previously been told about. The High Court was told a scan of the baby's brain made for ""sad reading"". His mother responded: ""We have not even read it"" and her husband walked out. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) wants to remove Charlie's life support. Earlier, the judge urged protestors supporting the family not to target the hospital. Charlie Gard's medical case explained,external Charlie has '10 per cent improvement chance',external The 11-month-old suffers from a rare genetic disorder and underwent a brain scan at the weekend to help settle a medical dispute about whether his treatment should be continued or whether he should be allowed to die with dignity. On hearing the hospital lawyer's assessment of the scan, Charlie's mother Connie Yates broke down in tears and his father Chris Gard shouted ""evil"" at the lawyer before walking out of court earlier. The case has been the subject of a lot of media attention Charlie's parents are fighting for the right to remove their child from GOSH's care. They want instead to take him to the US for experimental treatment, which a neurologist from New York said might give him a 10% chance of improving his health. The case has attracted a lot of attention around the world and campaigners who want the judge to ""let Charlie live"" have lined the High Court entrance for the hearings. Previously, the judge has condemned people who had abused and threatened GOSH medics on social media as a result of Charlie's case. Mr Justice Francis, who is presiding, warned earlier there were ""lots and lots"" of other sick children being treated by the hospital whose families might not want to be confronted by campaigners. GOSH has confirmed it received complaints from family members of other children being treated at the hospital, but would not provide further details. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside Mr Justice Francis will analyse the latest expert evidence at a High Court hearing on Monday and Tuesday. At a preliminary hearing on Friday, he said he would need to know whether there was ""new material"" which could make a ""difference"". Lawyers representing GOSH said they had ""yet to see"" any new evidence. A US doctor who has offered to treat Charlie has attended a meeting with his GOSH care team to decide whether he should travel to America for therapy.

"Thomson has apologised to passengers for the delay A flight from Aberdeen to Faro in Portugal has finally arrived at its destination after take-off was delayed by more than 38 hours. The 140 holidaymakers had been stranded at Aberdeen Airport since arriving on Thursday morning for what should have been the 06:00 flight. The flight was delayed because of a technical issue with the aircraft. There were also 114 stranded Thomson passengers in Portugal waiting for the return flight. The flight from Aberdeen to Portugal did not depart until 20:43 on Friday evening, the airline said. Those affected by the delay were put up in hotels overnight and given vouchers to buy refreshments. Thomson said the Aberdeen to Faro flight had arrived at 23:40 local time. Passengers flying from Portugal were diverted to Manchester and then taken to Aberdeen on a coach, arriving in the city at about 01:00 on Saturday. In total, 245 passengers in Aberdeen and Faro were affected by the delay ""We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers who travelled on flights FPO811 from Aberdeen to Faro and FPO812 from Faro to Aberdeen, which unfortunately were delayed as a result of a technical issue,"" a spokeswoman for Thomson said. ""We provided affected customers with overnight accommodation and vouchers for refreshments. We also be providing letters to customers with EU flight delay claim information in line with the Civil Aviation Authority's guidelines. ""We understand how frustrating a flight delay can be and we would like to thank affected passengers for their patience and understanding."" Speaking earlier on Friday, Susan Davidson told BBC Scotland that she and the other passengers had been taken off the aircraft shortly before it had been due to depart Aberdeen on Thursday morning. ""We were really given no information whatsoever and just left waiting in the airport,"" she said. ""Finally I think it must have been about 14:15 yesterday we were told we would be put up in a hotel and just to await further information from the company."" Mrs Davidson said passengers had been ""pretty much kept in the dark"" by the airline, with most of the information coming from the hotel she had been staying at. She added: ""The children are exhausted and desperate to get away. It has just been awful."" James Hepburn, who should also have been on the flight from Aberdeen on Thursday morning, described the delay as ""horrific"" and said he was ""very, very angry"".

"Chuka Umunna was briefly a contender for the Labour leadership in 2015 A UKIP AM has been recorded using a racial slur about an MP in a phone call to a former member of her staff. North Wales AM Michelle Brown was recorded using derogatory comments about Labour MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna, in a call in May 2016 to her then senior adviser Nigel Williams. Ms Brown said her language was ""inappropriate"" and has apologised. Mr Williams, who was her senior adviser for 12 months, was sacked by Ms Brown in May. Ms Brown, who called Mr Umunna a ""coconut"", was also recorded using an abusive remark about Tristram Hunt, who was then Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central. Michelle Brown was one of seven politicians elected as UKIP AMs in 2016 In a statement, Ms Brown said: ""The point I was making is that because of his considerable wealth and privilege, Chuka Umunna cannot possibly understand the difficulties and issues that the average black person faces in this country any more than I can, and I stand by that assertion. ""I do however accept that the language I used in the private conversation was inappropriate and I apologise to anyone that has been offended by it. ""As far as the language I used about Mr Hunt is concerned, it was a private conversation and I was using language that friends and colleagues often do when chatting to each other."" An assembly Labour Group spokesman said: ""This is absolutely outrageous language and lays bare the disgusting racism at the heart of UKIP. ""Anything less than immediate suspension would be a clear endorsement of Michelle Brown's racist slur."" Tristram Hunt quit as an MP to become the director of London's Victoria and Albert Museum Ms Brown's comments have been referred to the assembly's standards commissioner. Mr Williams said he believed Ms Brown should resign from her seat and UKIP's national executive committee should remove her from the party. ""You wouldn't expect anyone to say it, let alone somebody in such a position. It's appalling,"" he said. ""Michelle Brown is not fit for office saying things like that. UKIP HQ should do the right thing. The party does not want people with views like that in the party. End of."" UKIP AM David Rowlands said he ""thought we'd put that racist language behind us as a party"". The regional AM for South Wales East said: ""It's an inappropriate comment. It's certainly not the kind of language I'd use. ""I don't know if there's been any provocation but I'm very disappointed that anyone in my party should be using that language. ""However, it does puzzle me that someone can record and release a private call without the knowledge of the other person."" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: ""This racism reflects poorly on our parliament -  The National Assembly for Wales - and that's why her party should take action on this. ""No to racism in all its forms. No tolerance on racism in our Assembly."" This is not the first controversy Ms Brown has faced - in February, she wasforced to deny claims she had smoked ""recreational drugs""in a Cardiff Bay hotel room.

"A plan to scrap first class compartments on commuter trains is the lead for the Daily Telegraph. The paper has an interview,externalwith Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who uses the train to get to his Whitehall office. He says he understands what a pain it is for passengers to stand in packed standard-class carriages, while first-class compartments are empty. The Telegraph says it first highlighted the issue of half-empty first class carriages on packed commuter trains in 2013 and it thinks scrapping them is ""a first class idea"". TheDaily Mail,externalleads on the row between Boots and a number of female Labour MPs over the chain's refusal to cut the price of the morning-after pill. Boots put out a statement late last night apologising for its initial response and saying it was looking for cheaper alternatives.  It had earlier suggested it didn't want to encourage the overuse of the morning-after pill. In an editorial, the Mail welcomes what it describes as Boots' ""principled stand"" calling it ""refreshing"".  It describes the Labour MPs - who'd called for a boycott of Boots -  as ""contemptible"". The row over BBC pay rumbles on, and theDaily Mirror,externalleads with a claim that BBC bosses held a string of frantic talks with female stars before details of huge pay disparities with men became public. One unnamed source is quoted saying: ""The BBC might describe them as contract negotiations, but it looked like hush money to me."" Charles Moore in the Telegraph,externalpoints out - among many things - that if the women get more while the men stay on the same then the whole point of exposing the figures in the first place, to force the BBC to control its costs, will have been upended. According to theTimes,,externalhard-left Labour supporters are plotting to oust the party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, over what they see as disloyalty to Jeremy Corbyn. They're said to want to replace him with the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Sources close to Ms Thornberry have said the claims are categorically untrue. TheGuardian,externalreports that Interpol has circulated the names of 173 so-called Islamic State militants it believes could have been trained to mount suicide attacks in Europe. The list was drawn up by US intelligence from information captured during assaults on IS territories in Syria and Iraq. TheDaily Express,,externalmeanwhile, highlights the case of an illegal migrant in Bishop Auckland in County Durham, who's been spared jail despite allegedly saying he wanted to kill all the English; he was arrested after bursting into a Methodist church during a Sunday service. The paper says Home Office officials failed to take the opportunity to seek a deportation order - and Crown Prosecution Service lawyers rejected a request by magistrates to consider more serious charges. An investigation into cyber-crime by thei paper,externalreveals what the paper calls ""the shocking truth behind the threat you face"". The paper talks of a ""tidal wave of attacks"" costing the British public more than the budget of the NHS. It says 85% of attacks go unsolved by the police, as criminal gangs steal millions of pounds every day. Examples of victims include everyone from GPs targeted by identity thieves, to a grandmother defrauded of her life savings. And, the paper says, police in South Yorkshire have had to drop investigations six times in the past three years - after discovering the alleged offenders were under ten years old.

"Ms MartÃ­nez (right) says she was born in 1956 as a result of an affair between DalÃ­ and her mother Salvador DalÃ­'s moustache is intact in the ""10 past 10"" position, the surrealist painter's foundation has said, a day after his body was exhumed. ""It was like a miracle,"" said Narcis Bardalet, who was in charge of embalming DalÃ­'s body 28 years ago, adding that the hair was also intact. The body was exhumed in the north-eastern Spanish city of Figueres to settle a paternity case. A woman says her mother had an affair with the world-famous artist. If MarÃ­a Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez is proved right, she could assume part of DalÃ­'s estate, currently owned by the Spanish state. Why experts question artist paternity claim DalÃ­'s body was exhumed from a crypt in a museum dedicated to his life and work on Thursday evening. ""When I took off the silk handkerchief, I was very emotional,"" Mr Bardalet told RAC1 radio station on Friday morning. ""I was eager to see him and I was absolutely stunned. It was like a miracle... his moustache appeared at 10 past 10 exactly and his hair was intact,"" he added. LluÃ­s PeÃ±uelas, the secretary of the Gala-Salvador DalÃ­ Foundation, said that it was ""a moving moment"". This video can not be played Salvador DalÃ­'s body exhumed in Spain DNA samples have been taken from the artist's teeth, bones and nails in a four-hour operation, the officials say. It may take weeks before the results of the tests are known. The exhumation went ahead following a court order on behalf of Ms MartÃ­nez. This was despite the objections of the local authorities and the DalÃ­ Foundation, both of which said that not enough notice had been given. Ms MartÃ­nez, a tarot card reader who was born in 1956, says her mother had an affair with DalÃ­ in the year before her birth. Her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in CadaquÃ©s, near the painter's home. Ms MartÃ­nez's action is against the Spanish state, to which DalÃ­ left his estate. BBC Arts: What is Surrealism? How the world went crazy for Surrealism This video can not be played Will Gompertz explained how Dali's body would be removed Ms MartÃ­nez says her mother and paternal grandmother both told her at an early age that DalÃ­ was her real father. But the claim has surprised many, including Ian Gibson, an Irish-born biographer of DalÃ­, who said that the notion of the artist having an affair that produced a child was ""absolutely impossible"". ""DalÃ­ always boasted: 'I'm impotent, you've got to be impotent to be a great painter',"" the biographer said. DalÃ­'s wife, Gala, died in 1982 - after which he is said to have lost much of his zest for life Born on 11 May 1904 in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain Produced more than 1,500 paintings throughout his career Married Elena Ivanovna Diakonova - or Gala - in 1934; they had no children The couple had an open marriage and regularly held orgies at their house - though DalÃ­ is said to have watched rather than participated Died on 23 January 1989 in Figueres Photo gallery of DalÃ­'s work Salvador Dali's body exhumed in Spain.

"This video can not be played Introducing drone registration ""is not about stopping people having fun"" The UK government has announced plans to introduce drone registration and safety awareness courses for owners of the small unmanned aircraft. It will affect anyone who owns a drone which weighs more than 250 grams (8oz). Drone maker DJI said it was in favour of the measures. There is no time frame or firm plans as to how the new rules will be enforced and the Department of Transport admitted that ""the nuts and bolts still have to be ironed out"". The drone safety awareness test will involve potential flyers having to ""prove that they understand UK safety, security and privacy regulations"", it said. The plans also include the extension of geo-fencing, in which no-fly zones are programmed into drones using GPS co-ordinates, around areas such as prisons and airports. ""Our measures prioritise protecting the public while maximising the full potential of drones,"" said Aviation Minister Lord Martin Callanan. ""Increasingly, drones are proving vital for inspecting transport infrastructure for repair or aiding police and fire services in search and rescue operations, even helping to save lives. ""But like all technology, drones too can be misused. By registering drones and introducing safety awareness tests to educate users, we can reduce the inadvertent breaching of airspace restrictions to protect the public."" Drones prompt 'flood' of complaints Police drone unit is first in UK Man fined over airspace drone flying There has not been a significant accident involving a drone yet, but there have been several reports ofnear misses with commercial aircraft. There have also been incidents ofdrones being used to deliver drugs to prison inmates. ""Registration has its place. I would argue it will focus the mind of the flyer - but I don't think you can say it's going to be a magic solution,"" said Dr Alan McKenna, law lecturer at the University of Kent.

"Iheanacho was found guilty on Friday A man has been found guilty of murder after battering his partner's five-year-old son to death in a park for losing a trainer. Marvyn Iheanacho, 39, subjected Alex Malcolm to a brutal attack in Mountsfield Park, Catford, south-east London, on 20 November last year. Witnesses heard a ""child's fearful voice saying sorry"", loud banging and a man screaming about the loss of a shoe, Woolwich Crown Court was told. He will be sentenced on Tuesday. Witnesses in the park heard a ""child's fearful voice"", loud banging and a man screaming about the loss of a shoe The jury heard Iheanacho, of Hounslow, was in a relationship with Alex's mother Lilya Breha and would often stay in her flat in Catford. Ms Breha nodded as the verdict was announced and quietly wept in court. Alex suffered fatal head and stomach injuries and died in hospital two days after the attack. One of his trainers was later found in the play area by police. One of Alex's trainers was later found in the play area by police Iheanacho, who was known to Alex as ""Daddy Mills"", admitted beating the boy before in a note in his diary which read: ""Do I really love Alex, five years old small cute lil boy. ""Who want nothing more, than daddy mills to love him protect him but most of all keep him from harm - even though I had to beat him just now for sicking up in the cab - why why why I say - so the answer is yes yes yes I love him and like with all my heart but may not enough."" Iheanacho, who denied murder, gave several different accounts of how the injuries were caused including that Alex fell off a climbing frame, which were all rejected by the jury. Rob Davis, district crown prosecutor, CPS London Homicide, said: ""Only Marvyn Iheanacho knows how Alex was fatally wounded but it is certain his anger boiled over at some point on that evening. ""His actions that day tragically ended a young boy's life and deprived a mother of her son. ""His efforts to cover up what really happened, first to Alex's mother by claiming Alex had simply fainted and hit his head, then by lying and repeatedly changing his story to police show his greatest concern was for himself.""

""When I was 16, my mum gave me a beautiful ring for my birthday. A year later in Art class, I took my rings off while painting and someone picked them up to keep. ""Two months later, I broke my ankle and was on crutches and used them when I went on a school trip to the Sydney Opera House... so many stairs! ""It took a long time to go up each stair outside, nearly at the top, looking carefully at each step so I wouldn't trip, I found my ring on one of the steps."" Ness, who still has the ring, told the BBC that she plans on giving it to her own daughter, Lila, when she turns 16.

"This video can not be played They were the largest crowds. Period. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has quit, reportedly in protest at an organisational shake-up. Mr Spicer stepped down because he was unhappy with President Donald Trump's appointment of a new communications director, according to reports. Combative Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci has been picked for the role that Mr Spicer partially filled. Mr Spicer's press briefings were a cable news hit, but in recent weeks he withdrew from the camera's glare. He told US media that the White House ""could benefit from a clean slate"". Later, appearing on Fox News, Mr Spicer said that with Mr Scaramucci's appointment there was a risk of ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" in the White House media operation, which was why he was stepping down. The 45 year old said he had told Mr Trump he ""would stay on for a few weeks to achieve a smooth transition"", and was looking forward to spending more time with his family. He defended the president's agenda and hit out at what he termed ""media bias"", saying: ""I was increasingly disappointed about the way the media here do their job, or don't do their job."" Who is 'The Mooch'? My six hectic months with Sean Spicer 10 surprising things Trump just said The shake-up at the White House comes amid several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US presidential election and whether Mr Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake"". inflating crowd size estimates at Trump inauguration at first briefing his appearance, particularly his suits, reportedly criticised by Trump saying Hitler never used chemical weapons and referring to Holocaust ""centres"" butt of text message joke by adviser Steve Bannon about his weight defending Trump ""covfefe"" tweet by saying it had hidden meaning frozen out of meeting with the Pope in Rome, despite being devout Catholic not invited to Paris for Trump visit Announcing that he would step down next month, Mr Spicer tweeted that it had been ""an honor & a privilege to serve"" the president. The BBC's White House reporter Tara McKelvey says journalists besieged the 18-acre complex so they could film Mr Spicer leaving. In an assured debut, he attended Friday afternoon's news conference to announce that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, formerly Mr Spicer's deputy, would step into his shoes. ""I love the president and it's an honour to be here,"" Mr Scaramucci said, adding: ""He is genuinely a wonderful human being."" He also said: ""The president has really good karma."" Mr Scaramucci, who has no previous experience in communications roles, paid tribute to Mr Spicer as ""a true American patriot"" and ""incredibly gracious"". ""I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he said. This video can not be played It's his first day, and he has to say sorry to the boss Mr Scaramucci also apologised and said he had been ""unexperienced"" as he explained his previous criticism of the president. In an August 2015 interview with Fox Business, he dismissed Mr Trump as a ""hack"" and ""an inherited money dude"" with ""a big mouth"". Mr Scaramucci is currently senior vice-president of the Export-Import Bank, a US government agency which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of American exports. A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January thatElton John would playat the new president's inauguration. The singer promptly denied it. Life on a White House staff is intense and exhausting. This administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show. Sean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date. It could also be a sign of bigger tremors to come. Mr Spicer was closely allied with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was his boss last year in the Republican National Committee. The Trump team has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear. Leaks abound. The prestige and power of advisers and aides wax and wane. Media reports abound of a White House under siege. And just a reminder - the Trump presidency is only six months old. Ms Huckabee Sanders read a statement from President Trump, saying: ""I am grateful for Sean's work on behalf of my administration and the American people. ""I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look as his great television ratings."" On day one in January, Mr Spicer set the tone of his relationship with the press by bursting into the briefing room to berate journalists for their reporting of crowd numbers at President Trump's inauguration. His proclivity for gaffes and garbling of his words, as well as making debatable assertions, soon made Mr Spicer a household name. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was named on Friday as the new White House press secretary But he could also be charming and was liked by many among the press corps. Mr Spicer was lampooned on topical comedy show Saturday Night Live, where Melissa McCarthy played him as a loud-mouthed bully who brandished his lectern at reporters. Mr Trump noted approvingly in April that Mr Spicer ""gets great ratings"". A month later, the president said: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up."" Mr Spicer was roundly mocked after he reportedly hid by a hedgerow on the White House grounds to avoid reporters on the night Mr Trump fired the FBI director in May. His last on-camera briefing was on 20 June, and there have been few since then. Members of the media have accused the Trump administration of attempting to kill off the daily news conferences to avoid scrutiny.

"NHS England has announced plans to stop doctors prescribing homeopathy, herbal and other ""low value"" treatments. It hopes to save almost Â£200m a year by ending what the head of the service called a ""misuse of scarce"" NHS funds. Prescriptions for conditions including diarrhoea, thrush, acne and acute pain are among those up for review. But the plans to scrap prescriptions for common health problems have been criticised by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society for hitting poorer families. The RPS argues that low earners will be ""disproportionately affected"". NHS England said 18 treatments - such as homeopathy and some types of pain relief - cost the taxpayer Â£141m a year and generally should not be prescribed. Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said he was determined to ""root out"" waste and inefficiency. He said: ""The public rightly expects that the NHS will use every pound wisely, and today we're taking practical action to free up funding to better spend on modern drugs and treatments."" He described homeopathy as ""at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds"". RPS England board chairwoman Sandra Gidley said: ""They should not be denied treatment because of an inability to pay. ""Longer term costs to the taxpayer of increased ill-health, subsequent GP consultations or visits to A&E must also be taken into account as a result of medicines not having been prescribed.""

"Thomson has apologised to passengers for the delay A flight from Aberdeen to Faro in Portugal has finally arrived at its destination after take-off was delayed by more than 38 hours. The 140 holidaymakers had been stranded at Aberdeen Airport since arriving on Thursday morning for what should have been the 06:00 flight. The flight was delayed because of a technical issue with the aircraft. There were also 114 stranded Thomson passengers in Portugal waiting for the return flight. The flight from Aberdeen to Portugal did not depart until 20:43 on Friday evening, the airline said. Those affected by the delay were put up in hotels overnight and given vouchers to buy refreshments. Thomson said the Aberdeen to Faro flight had arrived at 23:40 local time. Passengers flying from Portugal were diverted to Manchester and then taken to Aberdeen on a coach, arriving in the city at about 01:00 on Saturday. In total, 245 passengers in Aberdeen and Faro were affected by the delay ""We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers who travelled on flights FPO811 from Aberdeen to Faro and FPO812 from Faro to Aberdeen, which unfortunately were delayed as a result of a technical issue,"" a spokeswoman for Thomson said. ""We provided affected customers with overnight accommodation and vouchers for refreshments. We also be providing letters to customers with EU flight delay claim information in line with the Civil Aviation Authority's guidelines. ""We understand how frustrating a flight delay can be and we would like to thank affected passengers for their patience and understanding."" Speaking earlier on Friday, Susan Davidson told BBC Scotland that she and the other passengers had been taken off the aircraft shortly before it had been due to depart Aberdeen on Thursday morning. ""We were really given no information whatsoever and just left waiting in the airport,"" she said. ""Finally I think it must have been about 14:15 yesterday we were told we would be put up in a hotel and just to await further information from the company."" Mrs Davidson said passengers had been ""pretty much kept in the dark"" by the airline, with most of the information coming from the hotel she had been staying at. She added: ""The children are exhausted and desperate to get away. It has just been awful."" James Hepburn, who should also have been on the flight from Aberdeen on Thursday morning, described the delay as ""horrific"" and said he was ""very, very angry"".

"Results of Charlie's scan were heard in court before his parents had been informed privately Charlie Gard's parents reacted angrily in court when medical information was revealed about their son which they had not previously been told about. The High Court was told a scan of the baby's brain made for ""sad reading"". His mother responded: ""We have not even read it"" and her husband walked out. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) wants to remove Charlie's life support. Earlier, the judge urged protestors supporting the family not to target the hospital. Charlie Gard's medical case explained,external Charlie has '10 per cent improvement chance',external The 11-month-old suffers from a rare genetic disorder and underwent a brain scan at the weekend to help settle a medical dispute about whether his treatment should be continued or whether he should be allowed to die with dignity. On hearing the hospital lawyer's assessment of the scan, Charlie's mother Connie Yates broke down in tears and his father Chris Gard shouted ""evil"" at the lawyer before walking out of court earlier. The case has been the subject of a lot of media attention Charlie's parents are fighting for the right to remove their child from GOSH's care. They want instead to take him to the US for experimental treatment, which a neurologist from New York said might give him a 10% chance of improving his health. The case has attracted a lot of attention around the world and campaigners who want the judge to ""let Charlie live"" have lined the High Court entrance for the hearings. Previously, the judge has condemned people who had abused and threatened GOSH medics on social media as a result of Charlie's case. Mr Justice Francis, who is presiding, warned earlier there were ""lots and lots"" of other sick children being treated by the hospital whose families might not want to be confronted by campaigners. GOSH has confirmed it received complaints from family members of other children being treated at the hospital, but would not provide further details. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside Mr Justice Francis will analyse the latest expert evidence at a High Court hearing on Monday and Tuesday. At a preliminary hearing on Friday, he said he would need to know whether there was ""new material"" which could make a ""difference"". Lawyers representing GOSH said they had ""yet to see"" any new evidence.

"Davison (left) and Baker (right) expressed divergent opinions over Whittaker's casting Two ex-Time Lords have had a war of words over Jodie Whittaker being cast as TV's first female Doctor. Peter Davison, who played the Doctor from 1981 to 1984, said he ""liked the idea"" of a male Doctor and that he felt ""a bit sad"" the character might no longer be ""a role model for boys"". His comments were promptly dubbed ""rubbish"" by his successor Colin Baker. ""You don't have to be of a gender to be a role model,"" said the actor, who portrayed the Doctor from 1984 to 1986. ""Can't you be a role model as people?"" What happened at Comic-Con Day One? Comic-Con: What you should look out for Doctor Who's 13th Time Lord to be a woman All the Doctors, from Hartnell to Whittaker The actors were speaking on Thursday at Comic-Con,the world's largest celebrationof film, TV and pop culture. Baker, the father of four daughters, said the BBC show's 54-year history had given young male viewers plenty of figures to emulate. ""They've had 50 years of having a role model,"" said the 74-year-old. ""So sorry Peter, you're talking rubbish there - absolute rubbish."" Davison - whose own daughter Georgina is married to David Tennant, another ex-Doctor - accepted ""you need to open it up"" and that he was ""maybe an old-fashioned dinosaur"". John Barrowman has also been at Comic-Con in San Diego this week The news that Whittaker will inherit the Tardis from Peter Capaldi this Christmas has been a major talking point at the San Diego event. John Barrowman asked fans to give the Broadchurch actress a chance while making his own Comic-Con appearance on Thursday. ""If we buy into the world of Doctor Who... it doesn't say that he will be a he all the time,"" said the actor. Barrowman, who played Captain Jack Harkness in the programme and its spin-off Torchwood, donned aglittery mini-dress,externalmodelled on the Tardis while appearing at the San Diego Convention Centre. Closer to home, Whittaker's casting as the 13th Doctor continues to animate other former stars of the long-running series. Agyeman played Martha Jones opposite David Tennant's Doctor Freema Agyeman, another former companion of the TV time-traveller, said she was ""overjoyed"" that a woman had finally landed the role. ""I feel like standing on top of a rooftop and shouting for joy,"" said the actress, who confessed to being ""astounded"" by the ""furore"" that the casting announcement had generated. ""The strength of the show and the reason for its longevity is the way it keeps changing and shifting,"" she told the BBC this week.

Agyeman, who played Martha Jones opposite Tennant's Doctor, will shortly be seen inApologia,externalat London's Trafalgar Studios alongside The West Wing's Stockard Channing.

"Andre Spicer said his daughter burst into tears and told him ""I've done a bad thing"" A five-year-old girl was fined Â£150 by a council for selling 50p cups of lemonade to festival goers. The girl's father Andre Spicer said his daughter had set up the stall in Mile End, east London, while thousands of music fans were on their way to the Lovebox Festival at the weekend. Mr Spicer said his daughter burst into tears and told him ""I've done a bad thing"". Tower Hamlets Council has since cancelled the fine and apologised. The girl was fined for trading without a licence Mr Spicer said his daughter loved the idea of setting up a stall near their home. ""She just wanted to put a smile on people's faces. She was really proud of herself,"" he said. ""But after a small time trading, four enforcement officers walked over from the other side of the road. ""I was quite shocked. I thought that they would just tell us to pack up and go home. To operate a market stall, you will need a street trading licence There are two types of street trading licences: temporary and permanent The application fee for both temporary and permanent licences is Â£75 You must be over 17 years of age to hold a licence To sell hot/high risk food, there are several extra restrictions in place on a street trading licence Source: Tower Hamlets Council ""But they turned on their mobile camera and began reading from a big script explaining that she did not have a trading licence. ""My daughter clung to me screaming 'Daddy, Daddy, I've done a bad thing.' She's five. ""We were then issued a fine of Â£150. We packed up and walked home."" A council spokesman said: ""We are very sorry that this has happened. We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense and to use their powers sensibly. ""This clearly did not happen.

"Canadian pop star Justin Bieber has been banned from performing in China, according to Beijing's Culture Bureau. In a statement, the ministry said it was not appropriate to allow in entertainers who have engaged in ""bad behaviour."" ""Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer,"" it added. The statement was issued in response to a question recently submitted by a user of the bureau's website. ""We hope that as Justin Bieber matures, he can continue to improve his own words and actions, and truly become a singer beloved by the public,"" the statement said. By John Sudworth, BBC Beijing correspondent To its list of hostile foreign forces - one assumes ranking somewhere below the Dalai Lama and Taiwanese separatists - China has added the name Justin Bieber. The news came in a statement from the Beijing municipal culture bureau, answering a question from a fan about why, with the singer about to embark on an Asia-wide tour, no venues have been scheduled in mainland China. Justin Bieber is indeed ""talented at singing"" came the reply, but nonetheless it would not be appropriate to allow him to perform, because of what it called a number of incidents of ""bad behaviour."" It did not elaborate on exactly which of Mr Bieber's run-ins with the law it was referring to. The pop star, who was allowed to tour China in 2013, joins a long list of musicians who have found themselves similarly blacklisted. Most though, like the British band Oasis and the US group Maroon 5, because of perceived political statements, rather than on the grounds of bad behaviour. The shrine photo prompted a lot of scrutiny on social media This hasn't been the first time the Sorry singer has caused controversy in Asia. In 2014, Bieber caused upset on social media after he posted a photo of himself visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The shrine honours fallen warriors and pays tribute to convicted war criminals but in China and South Korea, the shrine is seen as a symbol of Japan not being sorry for its empire's past. But despite the singer taking the photo down and apologising, the Chinese were outraged. Their foreign minister's spokesperson said he hoped the singer had left Yasukuni with ""a clear understanding of Japan's history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan's militarism"". Justin Bieber will be performing in Asia as part of his Purpose World Tour from September, and will be playing in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.

"The UK is due to leave the EU on March 29 2019 The ""cabinet is united"" over the need for a transitional period after Britain officially leaves the European Union, Cabinet minister Michael Gove has said. He said an ""implementation period"" ensuring access to migrant labour and economic stability would happen. He said it must be driven by ""pragmatism"" but also recognise the UK's vote to leave the EU last year. It follows newspaper reports that free movement for EU citizens could continue for years after March 2019. The Times reports,externalthat the prime minister is ready to offer EU citizens free movement for up to two years after the UK officially leaves the EU - whilethe Guardian suggests it could be four years,external. Brexit transition may take two years Goldman urges Brexit transition A senior Downing Street source dismissed the reports as coming from ""someone on a flyer"" and said it was ""not the government's position"". But BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said there appeared to have been a hardening of opinion in cabinet around the concept of a transitional period between full EU membership and a new relationship after the official Brexit date of March 2019 - in which the UK would be outside the EU but in which some elements of its membership would continue for a fixed period. The new buzz word? Political correspondent Iain Watson What form will any transition take? Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent. Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit? The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table. There has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon. David Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit. And that necessarily means compromise at cabinet level as well as with the EU. Read more from Iain International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who campaigned for Brexit - said on Thursday he ""did not have a problem"" with the idea of an ""implementation phase"", which he suggested could be around two years. On Friday, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs International Richard Gnodde said a ""significant"" transitional period needed to be agreed as soon as possible. Asked about the newspaper reports on Friday, Mr Gove said: ""The prime minister has made clear, as we leave the European Union we will have an implementation period which will ensure that we can continue to have, not just access to labour, but the economic stability and certainty which business requests. And again that is something around which the government and the cabinet is united."" He recognised the importance of ""access to high quality labour"" for businesses and said any such transitional period should ""be driven by a shared pragmatic judgement"" involving the best interests of the UK economy and a ""smooth"" Brexit but which was also ""in line with the result that the British people voted for just over a year ago"". Immigration to the UK, particularly from poorer EU countries, was seen as a major issue in the referendum campaign. Newly elected Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""It is encouraging that some of the more sensible and pragmatic members of the government are beginning to exert themselves and look for a compromise, but it is still the case that within a few years, British people are going to lose their right to move freely around the continent."" Speaking earlier, the former Labour chancellor Lord Darling said that a transition period after March 2019 was ""essential"" to stop businesses suddenly being deprived of European workers and told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If it's true that they are talking about up to four years, then I think that would be very welcome."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the question of a transitional deal was ""a matter for the negotiations"" but added that the British people had ""voted to take back control of our borders and that's what will happen post-Brexit"". Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: ""I don't think for one minute that the government is going to allow free movement after we come out of the EU."" He added: ""Free movement has to end no later than 31 March 2019 and I think most Conservative MPs would say that, the country would say that... and I think Mrs May would say that."" But UKIP's interim leader Steve Crowther said: ""Since the election, Theresa May is badly holed and unseaworthy, and the Remainer Philip Hammond, who was on his way out of the door before 8 June, now sees an opportunity to fudge, delay and obfuscate until the end of the current parliament, to try and get the decision reversed."" On Friday, Downing Street said the government's ""overarching goal"" was for ""a smooth, orderly exit culminating in a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU, with a period of implementation in order to avoid any cliff-edges"".

"This video can not be played At least two people were killed in the tourist destination of Kos A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has killed at least two people on the Greek island of Kos, officials say. The 6.7-magnitude quake hit 12km (seven miles) north-east of Kos, near the Turkish coast, with a depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey said. On Kos, around 115 people were injured, including tourists - 12 of them seriously. Some buildings were damaged. Turkey's health minister said 358 were hurt in the Turkish city of Bodrum, but none seriously. The earthquake struck at 01:31 on Friday (22:31 GMT Thursday). The two deceased have not been named but police said that both victims were tourists - a 22-year-old from Sweden and a 39-year-old from Turkey. They died when the roof of a popular bar collapsed, police said. Dozens were wounded when buildings collapsed, some of them suffering broken bones, Kos regional government official Giorgos Halkidios said. The army is supporting the emergency services with the rescue operation, he added. Greek authorities said the 12 people seriously injured included tourists from Turkey, Sweden and Norway. Four were taken to Crete for treatment, and three to Athens. The director of the hospital in Crete told Greek Skai TV that one person was in a critical condition, while a Swedish tourist had lost a leg. The quake damaged a number of older buildings on the island of Kos Large cracks appeared on pathways near a port on Kos The Turkish foreign ministry said a ferry had been sent to evacuate 200 Turkish nationals from Kos back to Bodrum. Data from Turkey's disaster and emergency management authority, AFAD, showed that more than 40 aftershocks were felt in Turkey and Greece in the aftermath of the quake, some up to magnitude 4.6. British student Naomi Ruddock felt the earthquake in Kos, where she is on holiday with her mother. ""We were asleep and we just felt the room shaking. The room moved. Literally everything was moving. And it kind of felt like you were on a boat and it was swaying really fast from side to side, you felt seasick."" Ms Ruddock said that a staff member told her it was the worst earthquake the area had seen. ""All of a sudden it felt like a train was going right through the room,"" German tourist Vernon Hausman told Reuters. ""I told my son: 'Looks like an earthquake, so let's get the hell out of here.'"" Brits caught in 'terrifying' quake Kos was nearest to the epicentre of the quake and appeared to be the worst hit, with damage caused to a number of older buildings, including cracked walls and smashed windows. Officials say some of the damaged properties may not have been earthquake-proof Tourists headed to Kos airport after evacuating hotels and apartments The mayor said the buildings that suffered the most damage were built before ""earthquake building codes"" were introduced. ""The rest of the island has no problem. It's only the main town that has a problem,"" Mayor Giorgos Kyritsis said. Kos's port was put out of action, and a ferry was unable to dock due to damage at the harbour, Greek police said. Tourists later gathered outside terminal buildings at Kos airport having left their hotels and apartments. In Turkey, some witnesses described waking in the night after being violently shaken in their beds. Kristian Stevens, a British tourist in Didim, 90km (60 miles) from Bodrum, said the building he was in began to ""shake like a jelly"". Residents fled their homes and tourists ran from holiday apartments with pillows and blankets. Some sustained injuries after jumping from windows in panic, Turkish broadcaster NTV said. Sophie Wild, another British tourist in Turkey, said she fled her third-floor accommodation in the coastal town of Altinkum, about 40km from Bodrum (as the crow flies), when she woke to a loud banging noise.

"Ella Passchendaele is one of a handful of descendants with the battle still part of their name Passchendaele, Somme, Arras, Cambrai, Verdun, Dardanelles, Ypres and Jutland. There were not only the names of World War One battles, but also the names given to babies, usually in commemoration of a father or relation who fought and died there. It might sound strange to modern ears, but more than 1,600 children during and after World War One were given names related to the war, even down to calling babies Vimy Ridge or Zeppelina. The war literally became part of their identity - and they became a form of living commemoration. The names tended to be given to girls rather than boys and the battle names were feminised, such as Sommeria, Arrasina, Verdunia, Monsalene and Dardanella. With the centenary commemorations approaching for the Battle of Passchendaele, there have been efforts to trace families who have passed down these names through the generations. This video can not be played Why were babies named after Passchendaele? Sean Coughlan reports for BBC Radio 4's PM programme Ella Passchendaele Maton-Cole, a 19-year-old in Alton, Hampshire, is one of the few remaining people with a name taken from the battle of Passchendaele, which began on 31 July 1917. This became one of the most well-known battles of World War One, with appalling conditions, terrible casualties and great heroism. There were 320,000 killed and wounded on the Allied side, in a battle fought in mud so deep and treacherous that men drowned in it. Ella Passchendaele's name was handed down through her great grandmother, Florence Mary Passchendaele, named after her cousin, Frederick Fullick, who had died during the battle in September 1917, aged 24. Ella says the connection is ""bittersweet"", but she likes having a name with such history behind it. She is a similar age to many of those who died in the battle in Belgium a 100 years ago and she says that the name gives her a sense of ""connection"". Ella Passchendaele with her great grandmother Florence Mary Passchendaele ""It's not that I'm named after all the deaths,"" says Ella. But she is proud to be named in honour of an ancestor who fought there. Researchers at the National Archives in Kew found a letter sent to Frederick's sister from an officer, who had been there when he died. ""I was in charge of the party of men who carried him to the dressing station and I can certainly assure you he was perfectly calm and collected,"" the officer had written. Jessamy Carlson, a historian and archivist at the National Archives, says the naming of children after battles was a way of honouring the dead and for families to keep a ""personal, tangible connection"" with a lost husband, father or relative. She says it also shows the ""extent to which war became part of everyday life"". ""You have an experience that is all pervasive. You have women whose husbands are away, dying far from home - and naming their children in this commemorative way is a way of holding them close,"" says Ms Carlson. In the first stages of the war, the battle names tended to be generic locations - with children given names such as Belgium or Frances (after France) or Calais, where soldiers might have disembarked. But Ms Carlson says that as the war progressed the names became specific to battles, such as Arras, Mons and Somme, and then down to particular parts of battles, such as Delville Wood. The trend was particularly prevalent in south Wales - and the brother of the actor Richard Burton was called Verdun, after the battle in France. Verdun became the single-most used battle names, adopted by more than 900 families. Passchendaele, with its huge casualties, also became a source of names for babies. Passchendaele was one of the bloodiest and muddiest battles of the First World War ""The thing that Passchendaele is now most famous for is the mud. It started raining the day after the battle started and continued for a month and turned the western front into a quagmire,"" says Ms Carlson. ""The modern resonance of Passchendaele is the extensive loss of life and horrific conditions - and to see children named after this seems quite poignant,"" she says. Battle of Passchendaele to be commemorated Video: Poppy pins made from Passchendaele battlefield shells Official centenary events for Passchendaele,external Chris Oswald from Wiltshire is from another family which used Passchendaele as a name, after a grandfather who fought there and won a Distinguished Conduct Medal for bravery. ""It's difficult now for modern people to understand the effects that it must have had on a generation, the cataclysm of World War One must have changed the way people saw things. ""I can understand that creating a memorial with a name like Passchendaele is something that would have seemed perfectly normal."" As the war ended, there was another flurry of names such as Peace, Poppy, Armistice and Victory. There will be national commemorations for Passchendaele beginning next week, marking one of the most intense and controversial battles of World War One, which cost hundreds of thousands of casualties and saw the front line moving only by a few miles. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley says it was ""very touching"" to think of those who died there being remembered through the descendants named after them. ""It is fitting, that in its centenary year, we are uncovering the forgotten stories that link people to Passchendaele,"" she said. Ella Passchendaele is one of a handful of people who still have the name. The monumental attack on German lines on a summer day in Belgium in 1917, is now in the name of a teenager talking on a summer's afternoon in Hampshire a century later. She says when she was at school she was always being asked about a name that seemed so unusual. ""I used to write my name on my text books and everyone would say: 'What is that?'"" Now she says she wants to carry on the name for another generation. ""That's why when I'm older I'll be naming my children Passchendaele for their middle names.""

"This video can not be played Meet the three men who 'married' each other A so-called ""throuple"" in Colombia have been hailed as having the first legal union between three men in the world. So will we see three-way marriages in the future? ""Victor tells the bad jokes,"" says Manuel. ""Very bad,"" agrees his partner Alejandro. ""I tell the smart ones,"" says Manuel. Manuel JosÃ© BermÃºdez Andrade, VÃ­ctor Hugo Prada and Alejandro RodrÃ­guez are all in a relationship together. They used to be four but their boyfriend Alex EsnÃ©ider Zabala died in 2014. ""The decision to marry was there before Alex died, the four of us wanted to get married,"" says VÃ­ctor. ""Alex's cancer changed our plans. But I never gave up."" When Alex died, the remaining three, who live in the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n, say they had to fight to be seen as his partners and get access to his pension. It made them all the more determined to get legal recognition of their relationship. Alex EsnÃ©ider Zabala was in the relationship for eight years before he died in 2014 They are now planning their long-awaited wedding ceremony after a supportive lawyer signed a special legal document last month. ""A document that tells us we are a family, and live together as three under the same roof, sharing a bed, a table, everything a family does,"" explains VÃ­ctor. The paperwork formalises their union, but it is not a full marriage certificate. Like in most countries - except those that accept polygamy - it is illegal to marry more than one person in Colombia. But Alejandro, Manuel and VÃ­ctor's legal success is a big step forward in a world where group marriage has been firmly off the agenda. Could cases like theirs signal the start of a concerted effort by campaigners to allow it? ""The movement is absolutely going to develop if the activists so choose,"" says Hadar Aviram, a professor of law at University of California in the US. A romantic relationship where those involved agree it is OK for everyone to be open to or have more than one romantic partner Some groups allow their members to seek additional partners, while others do not Distinctions are drawn with polygamy - or more specifically polygyny - in some Muslim societies and fundamentalist Mormon communities when one man may have multiple wives, based on a perception this is inherently disempowering for women Source:More than Two,external Read more How does a polyamorous relationship between four people work? Does anyone believe in monogamy any more? Prof Aviram said she found little appetite for marriage among polyamorous groups when she first started her research in 2004 but she began to see a change around 2012. Astudy by the US-based organisation Loving More,externalthe same year found that 65.9% of more than 4,000 polyamorous people said would want to marry multiple people if such marriages were legal. The same year there werereports of a three-way civil unionin Brazil. In 2015three men in Thailand,externalapparently had a Buddhist wedding ceremony. Prof Aviram believes changing attitudes may be due to wider acceptance of same-sex marriage around the world, making way for new taboos to be broken. ""Perhaps in the 1970s, same-sex marriage was as unimaginable as group marriage is today,"" she says. Legal marriage may still seem a distant prospect but cases like that in Colombia are giving hope to others in three-way relationships. ""It's really encouraging,"" says DeAnna Rivas, a married mother of two from Florida. The 28-year-old suggested to her husband, Manny, that they start experimenting with another woman in 2014. ""I grew up having crushes on both men and women,"" she says. ""But by the time I got married to Manny I had been with him for five years and our relationship was based on me and him."" Manny and DeAnna, pictured with their children Vaneza and Gabriel, got married in 2013 after five years together But after the birth of their second child, DeAnna was struggling with depression and felt she could not get enough emotional support from her husband alone. ""I was so unhappy I couldn't express my feelings to him. I had another part of me that was missing. ""When we met Melissa it just felt right."" DeAnna, an art teacher, now lives with both Manny and 20-year-old Melissa James; they share incomes, childcare and household duties, and a bed. ""It's the majority of men's fantasies to have two women,"" says Manny, a boat salesman. ""At the same time when we first started it was kind of daunting. ""I was a little fearful as far as bringing someone else into our relationship - I thought maybe she'd want to take my wife. ""But we gave it a shot and it worked out a lot better than I expected."" The family find it helpful to have three incomes but the best thing is the ""amount of love in our home"", Manny says Manny, 30, says some people are upset by the relationship - a previous employer even threatened to sack him as a result - but others are intrigued. ""Most people immediately think of polygamy and Mormons when they first hear about it and they don't like the idea of a guy with two wives, who don't interact."" ""When I say it was more my wife's idea than mine, then people get more understanding."" The trio admit they have all struggled with jealousy but they have learned to be more open with each other. They are now planning a wedding ceremony for June 2020. ""I'd like something beautiful and casual,"" says shop worker Melissa. ""With a trellis covered in flowers and a rainbow colour theme."" Vaneza and Gabriel ""love having two moms"", according to DeAnna They have even picked out a tuxedo for Manny to wear to the ceremony. But the marriage will not be legal. They must find alternative ways to have their family recognised. Manny and DeAnna are giving Melissa guardianship of their two children, who already call her ""Mamma MJ"". Melissa is also planning to change her name to Rivas. Without marriage rights, though, people even in the most committed polyamorous relationships do not have access to the same legal and tax benefits as married couples. The idea has provoked backlash, including in deeply Catholic Colombia where there are calls for the Medellin lawyer to be investigated. The trio say communication is the most important thing for maintaining a happy three-way relationship There are fears it could threaten the sanctity of marriage or encourage family break-up. Some gay rights advocates also oppose it, saying it makes a mockery of their fight for equality and undermines past assurances that same-sex marriage would not be a ""slippery slope"". Many people in polyamorous relationships are also sceptical themselves; they may have no desire to go public or embrace traditional family models, says Prof Aviram. ""People don't necessarily want to resemble the mainstream,"" she says. If things are going to change, there need to be more role models to show people that polyamorous relationships can last long term, she adds. Manny Rivas says he ""would love for us to be able to get legally married and show people there's nothing wrong with it, show people you can make it work. ""We could help other people accomplish their goals, be an inspiration,"" he adds. Additional reporting by Natalio Cosoy, BBC Colombia correspondent Meet the trio who 'married' each other.

"Levonelle can be taken within three days of having unprotected sex Boots has been accused of refusing to cut the cost of one of its morning-after pills for fear of criticism from campaigners. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which provides abortion care, wants Boots and other pharmacies to reduce the cost of emergency contraception Levonelle. Boots told the BPAS it wanted to avoid ""incentivising inappropriate use"". The company said it was ""disappointed by the focus"" BPAS had taken. Currently, the progestogen-based drug Levonelle costs Â£28.25 in Boots, and its non-branded equivalent is Â£26.75. But the branded drug costs Â£13.50 at Tesco and a generic version is Â£13.49 in Superdrug. However, Superdrug charges Â£27 for Levonelle and Â£35 for an alternative emergency contraceptive pill, EllaOne. BPAS lobbied Boots to reduce the cost of the pill to make it more accessible for women having difficulty getting the drug quickly on the NHS. Clare Murphy, BPAS director of external affairs, said: ""Most people believe women should be able to access emergency contraception from pharmacies at an affordable price."" But the chief pharmacist at Boots UK, Marc Donovan, said: ""In our experience, the subject of [emergency hormonal contraception] polarises public opinion and we receive frequent contact from individuals who voice their disapproval of the fact that [Boots] chooses to provide this service. ""We would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product."" He added that the chemist wanted to avoid the pill ""being misused or overused"". MP Yvette Cooper told Boots on Twitter: ""This is patronising and pathetic - keeping emergency contraception price too high cos you don't trust women and are scared of critics."" When asked to explain their stance, Boots released a statement saying the price of emergency contraception included ""a professional healthcare consultation"". It said: ""This consultation helps support customers in their choice by examining an individual's full medical history and any potential drug interactions."" Sandra Gidley, chair of Royal Pharmaceutical Society England, said it wanted to see all community pharmacies in England supplying emergency contraception free through the NHS. ""NHS emergency contraception services have been available free through pharmacies in Scotland and Wales for some time and we would like to see that replicated across the whole of the country so women get better access, regardless of their ability to pay."" The morning after pill can be taken in the days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. In England, Levonelle and EllaOne are free of charge from most sexual health clinics, most GP surgeries and most NHS walk-in centres or urgent care centres - but they are free only to women in certain age groups from pharmacies in some parts of the country. In Scotland and Wales, the emergency contraceptive pill is available free of charge on the NHS from pharmacies, GPs and sexual health clinics. In Northern Ireland, some pharmacies allow it to be bought on the NHS, and it is available free of charge from sexual health clinics and GPs. How risky is the contraceptive pill?

"Blair Logan poured petrol onto his brother's bed before setting it alight A man has admitted murdering his brother by dousing him with petrol and setting him alight on New Year's Day. Cameron Logan, 23, died in the blaze in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, and his girlfriend Rebecca Williams, 25, was seriously injured. At the High Court in Glasgow, Blair Logan, 27, admitted murdering his brother and attempting to murder Ms Williams at the family home. He confessed 12 days after the attack but claimed he did not mean to kill. The court heard that the two brothers had a ""hostile"" relationship and Logan told police they had not spoken since the death of their grandmother in 2013. On the night of the fire, Cameron and Rebecca had arranged to stay the night at the family home after a party and his mother Catherine set up an inflatable mattress for them in the living room. Logan remained in his bedroom, emerging only to wish his parents a happy new year. The young couple returned from the party at about 04:00 and went to sleep. At about 07:15, Mrs Logan was woken by the family dog whining and went downstairs, where she saw a figure in dark clothing standing inside the living room. Cameron Logan and Rebecca Williams also saw the man, holding something that was on fire, and screamed. Cameron Logan died and Rebecca Williams was seriously injured in the fire on New Year's Day Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""Catherine Logan then heard Cameron roar in surprise, shock and fear, before the accused made a jerking motion with his arm as if throwing something. ""The accused then ran from the living room and went out the front door. ""Catherine Logan slammed the door behind him, shouting something like 'get the hell out of my house', still not knowing who it was. ""When she turned back towards the living room she saw 'orange and crackling' and the room turning black. She also heard Cameron and Rebecca screaming."" She tried in vain to open the door to the room before running to ask neighbours for help. Rebecca Williams managed to roll onto the floor and crawl into the kitchen. Unable to open the back door, she put her head in the fridge to protect herself from the fire before passing out. Mr Logan senior tried to get into the living room but was beaten back by the intensity of the smoke and flames. The prosecutor said the accused admitted pouring petrol ""with the intention of maiming or crippling"" his brother. But after his arrest, Logan told police: ""I didn't want to kill him."" In a police interview he said he took the petrol from a church garage a month and a half before the fire and stored it in his bedroom. Searches of his computer found he had researched burn injuries. The attack was said to be in retaliation for a ""last straw"" incident at the house a week earlier, when his brother had punched him. He said he did not realise Ms Williams was in the bed and had not intended to harm her, or his parents. Cameron Logan with the family dog Gomez which also died in the fire Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC said Logan showed ""wicked recklessness"" but did not intend to kill his brother. He was said to have ""felt physically sick at the whole thing"". Logan has been subject to two psychiatric reports which concluded there was not sufficient evidence for a plea of diminished responsibility. Ms McCall said there were ""unusual traits"" in Logan's personality and that he had a lack of understanding of the impact of his actions on other people. Rebecca Williams was in court to hear the guilty plea Both parents were in the court room in Glasgow, along with Ms Williams, as the guilty plea was made in front of judge Lady Scott. Ms Williams, a radio journalist, was rescued from the fire and treated in hospital for burns and the effects of breathing in smoke, and has undergone surgery on four occasions. She has had a tracheostomy to help her regain the power of speech. Logan's parents were treated for smoke inhalation but were not badly injured. Logan was arrested two weeks after the fire following a major Police Scotland investigation. The family dog, Gomez, was also killed in the fire. Logan also admitted endangering the lives of his parents. Lady Scott asked for a social worker report and set a sentencing date for 11 August at the High Court in Livingston.

"Lady Hale is the first female president of the UK's highest court Forthright in her views and a champion of diversity, Baroness Hale is a trailblazer whose life has been full of firsts. Born in Yorkshire, Brenda Hale is a grammar school girl whose parents were both head teachers. She achieved the only starred first in her year at the University of Cambridge, before going on to be the youngest person and first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission. Lady Hale played a significant role in introducing a number of reforms to the law, including the Children Act 1989, which is widely acknowledged as the UK's most important piece of legislation protecting children. In 2004, she became the first woman to be appointed as a Law Lord. When the Law Lords - who had sat in parliament as the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords - were given a new home in 2009, with the establishment of the UK Supreme Court, she became its first female justice. In 2013, she became its first deputy president and today becomes its first female president. But her route to becoming the most senior judge in the UK has been anything but conventional. First woman appointed as UK's top judge Unlike her fellow Supreme Court justices, Lady Hale spent many years in academia rather than legal practice. She remains an educator to the core. In 1966, she became an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester, where her interests were in social welfare and family law. She remained at the university for 18 years while also qualifying as a barrister. It is no surprise that she did so by achieving the highest mark in her year in the Bar Final exams in 1969. She followed this by developing a part-time practice in family law, which she managed to combine with her academic work. With her burgeoning CV, it was perhaps only a matter of time before she was appointed a judge in the family division of the High Court. She was the first academic - yet another first - to achieve such a move in 1994. She continued to play a role in legislative reforms, such as the introduction of the Family Law Act 1996, which covered domestic violence, and the Mental Health Act 2005. Lady Hale, front left, had been deputy president of the Supreme Court Lady Hale has always been acutely aware of the need for judges to be drawn from a diverse group within society. She has been all too conscious that diversity has been a stubbornly difficult problem for the judiciary to overcome and that it remains a major issue. Figures on judicial diversityreleased on Thursday,externalshow some progress in the last three years among senior judges. The percentage of female judges in the Court of Appeal has risen from 18% to 24%, and from 18% to 22% in the High Court. But there is still a woeful lack of diversity, with just 28% of court judges being female and only 7% coming from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Shortly after her appointment as the first female Law Lord in 2004, while speaking in a lecture, she said the gender and ethnicity of judges matters ""because democracy matters"". ""We are the instrument by which the will of Parliament and government is enforced upon the people. It does matter that judges should be no less representative of the people than the politicians and civil servants who govern us."" But she hasn't always been so diplomatic. In 2011, with typical candour, she said she found it ""quite shocking"" that so many senior judges were members of the all-male Garrick Club, a private members' club in London's West End. She suggested its popularity might contribute to male dominance of the bench, thanks to ""personal network relationships"". She has talked about the background of her fellow senior judges, who have moved from public school to Oxbridge colleges, to the Inns of Court, as being ""from quadrangle, to quadrangle, to quadrangle"". She acknowledges that she herself is part of the quadrangle by dint of going to Cambridge. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled against the government in the Article 50 case As a Supreme Court justice she has been the court's magnetic north on matters of family law. In 2011, in the housing case Yemshaw v LB Hounslow, she gave the lead judgement ruling that domestic violence was not limited to physical violence. In 2014, she effectively broadened the definition of what amounts to a deprivation of liberty for those who lack mental capacity and are detained in care homes and other institutions, writing famously in her judgement that ""a gilded cage is still a cage"". There has also been controversy. Lady Hale was criticised by Brexiteers for comments in a lecture to students in Malaysia, in which she appeared to speculate on aspects of legal questions in the Article 50 case before it had been heard by the court. She was forced to say publicly that she would not recuse herself from the case. She now faces huge challenges. Most importantly, she will have to steward the UK Supreme Court through the Brexit and post-Brexit period in which it will have to determine the weight to be given to decisions of the European Court of Justice. The UK's relationship with what is in effect the Supreme Court of the EU remains highly contentious, and the eyes of the pro-Brexit press, in particular, will focus laser-like on decisions of our own Supreme Court on issues of EU law. If she receives some personal criticism in the press, that will not be a first.

"Leading Brexiteers have said they are not opposed to a period of transition or implementation The government and the cabinet ""is united"". Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity. The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time. Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view. Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing -  or as some say ""no cliff edge"" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues. UK and EU at odds on Brexit 'bill' Goldman urges Brexit transition deal Fox: Brexit transition may take two years Brexit: All you need to know So much for unity. Where do differences still lie? It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy. But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist. Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years. As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter. But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a ""disaster"" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period. Business has said a ""cliff-edge"" change in regulations and procedures must be avoided Then what form will any transition take? Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent. Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit? The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table. So while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved. And, of course, I use the term 'Remainer"" historically - the cabinet is also united on leaving the EU but the question is how. There has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon. David Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit. And that necessarily means compromise at cabinet level as well as with the EU.

"A video of Jamel Dunn's last moments appeared on social media It is a harrowing video to watch: a man, crying out for help as he struggles to swim in the middle of a Florida pond. Off camera, the voices of five teens, mocking him. ""They drowning, what the heck,"" one laughs. ""Ain't nobody fixing to help you,"" another is heard to say. And, after his head disappeared under the water for the final time:  ""Oh, he just died."" The body of Jamel Dunn - a 32-year-old disabled father-of-two - was found in the water three days later, on 12 July. Up until that point, no one knew where he had gone. No one had called 911 to report a man in trouble. No one even knew anyone had witnessed the drowning until the video emerged on social media, and Dunn's family members saw it. Its contents have shocked the community in the city of Cocoa, on Florida's east coast. But the teens, aged between 14 and 16, will face no charges, prosecutors have said: there is nothing on the statute books which deal with an incident like this, they say. The family have shared this picture of Dunn on a GoFundMe page to help with funeral costs The vast majority of states in America do not put a ""duty to rescue"" on their citizens, but 10 do. But even these do not cover all instances. Florida is one of the few states to have such a law, but it only covers reporting a sexual battery if witnessed or suspected, according toThe Volokh Conspiracy,external, a blog written mainly by law professors. In fact, only a few countries in the world have a law which means people have to help or risk prison time, including Germany, where four people are currently being prosecuted for ""unterlassene Hilfeleistung"" (failure to provide assistance). Florida family rescued by beachgoers' human chain 'I was left to die on an island for getting pregnant' According to local reports in Germany, last October an 82-year-old man collapsed in a bank in Essen, but was then ignored by other customers, ranging in age from 39 to 62, for the next 20 minutes. A fifth customer eventually called an ambulance, but it was too late, and the man died a few days later in hospital. No-one in the case has been named. Perhaps the most high-profile instance of a law like this involved the death of Princess Diana. Seven photographers were accused of failing to render assistance by French investigators followingthe 1997 Paris crash,externalwhich killed the princess, her boyfriend Dodi Al-Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Photographers who took pictures immediately after Princess Diana's fatal crash were investigated The men had taken photographs rather than helping the dying occupants of the car, it was alleged. But after two years of investigation, all charges were dropped against them. But why would you have such rules? Surely people should help simply because it is the right thing to do? Sometimes, however, people are more worried about being landed with a bill - or getting into legal trouble. In China, that fear is so strong that when atwo-year-old girl was struckin a hit-and-run accident in the city of Foshan, Guangdong Province, 18 people ignored her before one person stopped to help. Wang Yue, two, is seen on CCTV before being hit by a vehicle. Wang Yue, who was nicknamed ""Little Yueyue"" by Chinese media, later died in hospital. The case sparked a national debate about China's morality, one which reared its head again this year, when a woman was struck by a car but then ignored by pedestrians crossing the road moments later. But many social media users understood the decision, according to theNew York Times,external. ""If I helped her to get up and sent her to the hospital, doctors would ask you to pay the medical bill,"" one wrote. ""Her relatives would come and beat you up indiscriminately."" The teenagers in the Florida case, however, would not have ended up in trouble. Every state in the US has a ""good Samaritan law"", which largely protects those who try to help in an emergency situation from being sued. But whether or not this factored into their thinking is unknown. The teens were heard to mention alligators - but that would not have prevented them calling 911. As for the moral argument, Yvonne Martinez, the Cocoa Police Department spokeswoman, told Florida Today at least one of the boys did not seem worried by the implications of what they had done. ""There was no remorse, only a smirk,"" she said. China mulls law after hit-and-run Opioid suspected in US boy's death Florida man shoots trucks outside home.

"Addicts gather under the bridges along the freight track, away from the public eye In a corner of Philadelphia known locally as the Badlands, where some of the purest heroin in the country can be bought for just $5 a bag, a half-mile stretch of rail track has become a refuge for hundreds of heroin addicts. Next week the city will begin to clearoutthe tracks, but where will the users go? At the top end of Gurney Street in Fairhill, Philadelphia, there's a dirt path that forks through some trees and winds behind an old car repair shop, down to the rail tracks below. Follow the path and you'll find a makeshift shooting gallery under a bridge, where heroin addicts gather out of sight and the ground is a sea of used syringes, cookers and needle caps. People stand around a wooden table to fix, tying on tourniquets and tapping in the crooks of their arms to bring up their veins. One man leans into a mirror to find a spot on his neck, carefully pushing a needle through the skin and rolling back into a chair, his eyes glazing over. Others line up along a long steel beam that forms part of the bridge, unwrapping fresh syringes and preparing to inject. For anyone too nervous, or too far gone, to find a vein, there's a man in a wooden shack a few metres away known as ""the doctor"", who will stick you for a dollar. This is ""El Campamento"", the busiest and most built-up of a handful of hidden-away injection sites along a half-mile stretch of freight track between 2nd Street and Kensington Avenue. For more than 20 years homeless people and drug users have sought refuge in this gulch, and today there are about 70 people living along the tracks and up to 200 passing through every day to shoot up. As nightmarish as it feels, users here say it's a safe place, away from the police and the rest of the public, where people look out for each other and outreach workers visit regularly. Narcan - a nasal spray that reverses overdoses - is never far away. But next week the city will begin to clear this stretch of track and force the users out. After months of negotiations between officials and rail company Conrail, contractors, guarded by police, will enter at the Kensington Avenue end and work their way up, disposing of an estimated 500,000 used needles, tearing down structures, and eventually paving over El Campamento and installing concrete rubble under the bridges to ward off new camps. The city wants the rail company to put up prison-grade fencing around the tracks Down by the tracks last week, news of the planned clearance was met with weary skepticism. ""If they push us up from here you're gonna have a bunch of junkies on the streets looking for somewhere else to shoot up,"" said Luis, a 41-year-old father-of-two with dark, matted hair and dull eyes, who asked us not to use his real name. Luis wakes up every morning in a rickety wooden shack and spends his days, like the doctor, injecting other users. The fee is one dollar or one sixth of a heroin shot, and most people pay in heroin. Every six injections Luis can do a hit of his own. For 22 months he was clean and clear of the tracks, until one day he came home to find his wife had suffered a heart attack in the bath and drowned. Perched on a concrete barrier on Gurney Street, he squinted against the sun, opening and closing a flick knife in one hand and letting a cigarette slowly burn away in the other. ""I had everything,"" he said. ""I had a beautiful life, I had a beautiful wife, and in the blink of an eye it got took from me. That was a year and a week ago."" Days after she died he was back on the tracks. ""At least down here you know you can get safe dope, you can get clean works, you can get high and nobody's gonna mess with you,"" he said. ""If they board this up I have to start again. I have to find a new place I can lay my head at night where I don't have to sleep with one eye open."" Walking the half-mile length of track, under a blistering midday sun that baked the rails, person after person said they would simply find another hole in Kensington, the neighbourhood around the tracks â a place already gripped by poverty and overrun by heroin. This video can not be played Life in a half-mile heroin encampment Kensington was once a vibrant industrial area that people came to from around Philadelphia in search of work. As the manufacturing trades died away, employment rates and house prices plummeted, homes were abandoned and boarded up and the drug trade moved in. Now people come to Kensington from around the city, state and country in search of heroin. The area is said to be the largest open-air drugs market on the East Coast. On nearly every block on the short walk from Gurney Street to Hope Park, dealers call out their brands â ""So Fly"", ""Caution"", ""Cowboy"" â and empty packets stamped with logos litter the way. The heroin sold here is among the purest, cheapest, and most lethal in the US. It courses through the veins of the place, turning public parks, churches, abandoned houses and street corners into venues to shoot up. Before the deal was struck to clear the tracks, the city cleared out McPherson Square, a small park on Kensington Avenue that had become a haunt for addicts. At the centre of the square is the local library, and when national media reported in May that librarians were being trained to revive overdosed users in the square â rechristened Needle Park by locals â it was enough. The drug users were driven out. ""Back in '70 this was a beautiful park,"" said Joe Grone, a 53-year-old who moved to the edge  of McPherson Square more than 40 years ago. He was pricked in the ankle by a used needle as he walked through the park last year, as was his five-year-old granddaughter as she sat on their front steps. ""This place should be for kids, not for needles,"" he said. Outreach workers fear users from the tracks will be pushed into abandoned row houses Joe Grone was pricked with a used needle near his home on McPherson Square Now a large mobile police unit sits near the middle of McPherson Square and officers roll around the perimeter on bikes. Last week, children were running around again, jumping through a sprinkler and screaming with delight. Save for the odd syringe cap nestled in the grass, it was a happy afternoon in Needle Park. But drug outreach workers here question where the users went. Shortly after the square was cleared, there were reports that an abandoned church on Westmoreland Street had become a haven for addicts. Police moved in to clear the church too, and in the sanctuary, Kate Perch, a housing co-ordinator for local outreach charity Prevention Point, found a young couple in the grip of addiction. They had fashioned a makeshift home around a mattress and hidden their belongings under the organ pipes. As the police waited, the couple discussed different abandoned row houses in the area, debating which were safe. ""That's a conversation which will keep happening in this neighbourhood,"" Ms Perch said. ""McPherson has been cleared, Westmoreland has been cleared, now the tracks are about to get cleared. What happens to these people when that site is no longer available? Where will they go that is safe?"" An abandoned church on Westmoreland Street which had become a haven for heroin addicts A message scrawled on the front door of the church as the users were cleared out The worry for people like Ms Perch is that vulnerable users will be pushed into the city's hundreds of abandoned houses â ""abandos"" â where it is too dangerous for outreach workers to go, where people will overdose and no one will see. The city is already predicting a 30% increase in overdoses this year, for the second year running, taking the grim toll from 900 to 1,200 - four times the estimated number of murders. Fentanyl â a tranquiliser 50 to 100 times more powerful than heroin which has been linked to deaths across the country - has taken hold, infecting the supply of heroin that floods into Philadelphia from the ports. ""The dope that's out there now... it's fentanyl, it's elephant tranquiliser, it's rat poison, stuff like that,"" said James Russell, a 30-year-old local with a 15-year heroin habit, who shakily made a cup of instant coffee as he waited for a check-up at Prevention Point. ""The way a lot of the fiends are here now, you hear someone shot a bag of dope and overdosed and seven out of 10 people rush to go find that dope. It's insane."" Jose Ojeda flew to Philadelphia full of hope. He came as an addict, seeking first-class treatment in the heart of the city. That's what they told him in Puerto Rico, anyway. But like thousands of others who had made the flight before him, he was heading for one of the city's unlicensed recovery houses, where users are exploited for their benefits and many wash out into the street, ending up places like the tracks. ""I'm searching for help but it's impossible for me because I don't have papers,"" said Jose, looking away as he spoke across an empty lot by the tracks, his eyes bloodshot, skin rough and needle-marked, one hand tightly cramped against his will. His ID was stolen with his wallet while he was passed out, he said. He thinks a lot about his mother who died in Puerto Rico while he was in Philadelphia, and about his daughter and his granddaughter who are still there. ""I'm trapped here now with my worn-out hands. I don't know how to speak English, I go places to ask for help and they don't understand me. It pushes me to drugs,"" he said. Without ID he can't get treatment and he can't get home. At 42, he's stuck in Kensington, a long way from Puerto Rico, with a heroin habit he can't shake. Jose Ojeda is one of thousands of Puerto Rican addicts who come to Philadelphia on a false promise of treatment Even with ID, the barriers to treatment in Philadelphia are high. The city has an estimated 70,000 active heroin users and fewer than 15,000 treatment options at any given time, adding every different type together. The Housing-First programme will put a roof over the head of users without demanding they are clean, but there are currently fewer than 40 slots available in the Kensington area for about 400 homeless people. The city has pledged an additional $250,000 to supportive housing and is planning a three-day ""resources fair"" on an empty lot on Gurney Street, to coincide with the track closure, but police will be in attendance and mistrust among users is endemic. Even if there were treatment options here for everyone, many in the grip of addiction are simply unwilling or unable to seek them. ""Addiction is a stigma driven disease in this country,"" said Roland Lamb, deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Behavioural Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIS). ""A person who is addicted only has about a one in 10 chance of getting the treatment they need."" Prevention Point's mobile needle exchange bus sits outside the old church where the charity lives DBHIS is working with city-funded outreach groups like Prevention Point, in an attempt to engage with users before the track clearout. The charity began life 25 years ago as an underground needle exchange and two years ago moved into an old brownstone Methodist church in the heart of Kensington, a few blocks from the tracks. Hundreds of users travel to the building from all corners of the neighbourhood and beyond, for a check-up, a pack of clean needles or just a chat, and for a few hours every day the old church has a congregation of sorts. ""This place is a blessing,"" said Laura, a 41-year-old regular who endured 15 years of homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution before getting clean and finding a place in shelter. ""When I first came here I was deep in my addiction,"" she said. ""They save lives here every day."" But not everyone is grateful. Prevention Point has faced resistance from local officials and residents, who say it draws addicts to the area. The clean needles they give out undoubtedly save lives - HIV infections from drug use in the city have dropped from 50% to just 5% since the charity began its work - but some people were putting them to use immediately on the streets outside the building. Jose Benitez is executive director at Prevention Point. ""The community's approach is, 'We don't want this in our neighbourhood', the city's approach is, 'Oh my god something must be done',"" he said. ""The trick is, what's the something?"" As word spread that the tracks would be cleared, fear and anger began to surface in local Facebook groups. Philadelphia should ""start executing drug dealers on the spot"", wrote one resident. ""Better solution, if someone comes into an emergency room full of heroin, let them DIE,"" wrote another. ""DEAD IS BEST,"" someone replied. The aggression worried Dan Martino, a part-time musician and local activist who volunteers with a grassroots group, Philadelphia Overdose Prevention Initiative (Popi). On the second Wednesday in June, Mr Martino went to Mick's Inn, a narrow, wood-panelled corner bar in Port Richmond, next to Kensington, where 30 or so local residents had gathered to discuss what would happen when the tracks were purged. After an hour or so of listening, he stood up to speak. He asked the residents if they would be interested in a solution which would lower the death rate by 30%. They murmured yes. He asked if they would like to see lower crime rates and needles off the streets and they agreed. Then he said he was talking about safe injection sites, and the atmosphere in the room turned. Two women stormed out. When the meeting spilled into the street Mr Martino approached one of them. Her daughter had died of an overdose, and she told Mr Martino she would want to shoot anyone she found giving addicts a place to inject. For some people around these neighbourhoods, safe injection sites â where users can test their drugs and inject in the presence of medical staff â are the last remaining hope. To others, they are unthinkable â a final nail in the coffin for a neighbourhood killed by heroin. ""We live in a world of heroin"" - Dan Martino advocates for safe injection sites in Philadelphia ""When I first started advocating for this there was a wall of resistance. People who would yell at me like I've never been yelled at by adult,"" Mr Martino said. ""But these people are going to use one way or the other. That's just the reality we live in. We live in a world of heroin. Until we can find a way to stop it coming in from the ports, this is what we have to do."" The woman who stormed out of the meeting was Kathleen Costello Berry, a lifelong Port Richmond local whose daughter overdosed at just 17 and was left in a hospital parking lot to die. ""I just had to leave, I couldn't even listen to him speak,"" she recalled. ""I lost my daughter. If anyone had dared to tell me she could come somewhere safe to shoot up and we'll keep an eye on herâ¦"" She trailed off, her voice cracking. ""No. No way. There is no safe way to shoot poison into your veins."" There are no safe injection sites in America, yet. As the nation's opioid epidemic spirals, several major cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, are beginning to consider taking the leap, but there is fierce political resistance to the idea. There is one such site in Canada though, in Vancouver, and statistics suggest it has stemmed the tide of dead bodies there. More than 700 injections take place every day in 13 mirrored booths and no one has died at the facility since it opened in 2003. The clinic estimates that it has prevented 5,000 fatal overdoses. But the then-Conservative government fought it all the way to the Supreme Court. Users shoot up at a safe injection facility in Vancouver In Philadelphia, a new opioid task force will ""further explore"" the possibility, said a spokesman for Mayor James Kenney, citing ""serious legal, practical, and law enforcement issues that have to be considered"" first. Some local officials remain opposed. ""It's taken a long time for us to hit rock bottom here,"" said Maria Quinones Sanchez, councilwoman for the city's 7th district, which encompasses Kensington. ""Do we want to now send a message that you can come here and buy the cheapest drugs available and then actually have a place to use them?"" But the current strategy - clearing out one park, church, or railway gulch and pushing people to the next - doesn't appear to be working. It has created a grim merry-go-round in Kensington that threatens to cause yet more lonely deaths. Consumed by addiction, and unready for treatment, most people along the tracks will continue to slip through the net. ""Heroin is what's killing people, but not giving people the opportunity to say help me, not giving people the opportunity to seek treatment - that keeps them in the basement, it keeps them in places like the tracks,"" said Mr Martino. ""These people don't want to die, despite their best efforts. They don't want to live like this."" ""If we get pushed out of here I'll use right on the street"", said Mark Vallotta, 39. ""I got nowhere else."" A tattoo points towards an old needle scar Down at the tracks last week, life was going on as usual. After so many delays, few people seemed to believe that the bulldozers would really roll through. But the rail company's deadline to start work is the end of the month, and the city has had enough. Luis was still injecting people and getting high off the profits, enough to dull the pain of the anniversary, a few days earlier, of his wife's death. He couldn't see a way out. ""I'll just try and break through the fence and come back in,"" he said. ""I ain't got no place else to go. It's here or nowhere."" A few feet away under the bridge, by the fixing table, another user, Manuel, shifted his weight from foot to foot and stared off into the distance, pushing a baseball cap absent-mindedly up and down his forehead. He recalled doing his first ever hit of heroin, years ago, by the tracks. ""This is where I started, it's the only place I've ever come to,"" he said. ""If this place wasn't here maybe it would be easier for me to stop. ""It's like my legs carry me here by themselves. If they close down these tracks, I dunno. I hope my legs take me somewhere better."" Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins The heroin-ravaged city fighting back.

"The summer holidays are under way, but for some children, the studying - and the homework - will continue. It was a moment of pure joy: school was out for summer. Your school bag was shoved in the back of a cupboard. School shoes went the same way. Ahead lay countless days of freedom, play and sunshine. That used to be the case for most children - yet not all youngsters today enjoy the same. There's school work to catch up on; a year's learning to consolidate. An 11-plus test in the autumn term, perhaps. So - some parents argue - why not study over the holidays? Vivienne Stiles tutors children aged between four and 16 throughout the summer. They attend a class twice a week, and are given between 15 and 90 minutes of maths and English homework every day. ""Children's brains need to be stimulated throughout the holidays,"" she says. ""You can't expect them to pick up in September where they left off."" By doing work little and often, says Vivienne, children maintain the stamina and concentration built up during term-time. Vivienne - who works for Kumon, a tutor company - says the children learn new skills, develop a strong work ethic and get into a good routine. The proof? She says her own daughter, now 19, went from a ""good C-grade student"" at the start of secondary school to getting a place at London's Royal Veterinary College, thanks in part to extra tutoring. Summer childcare costs at record level Counting the cost of school holidays Mother-of-two Tanith Carey was also a big believer in tutoring. That was until her eldest daughter, Lily, did not want to accept a school prize for science at the age of seven, saying she hated the fuss. It was then Tanith found out about the pressure her daughter was under. So, the maths tutoring through the holidays stopped, and Lily had more time to spend making up little worlds and imaginary characters with her younger sister, Clio. Clio plans to spend the summer holidays taking photos and cooking, says Tanith Tanith says that, like many parents, she had been swept along in a ""tide of panic"". ""Competition between parents is contagious - because they fear if another child gets ahead, their child will feel left behind. So it spreads,"" she says. ""I think it's sad that the summer months are viewed as an extension of the academic year - a chance for kids to catch up or get ahead."" In her book, Taming the Tiger Parent, Tanith writes about the concept of a child's spark. ""It's something that every child has and is the one thing they love doing and they lose themselves in and find easy,"" she explains. ""Children can only find it if they are left to their own devices."" Over the summer, 12-year-old Clio has decided she wants to take photographs and turn them into an album, and compile and bake some vegan recipes. Her sister, Lily, now 15, is going abroad on a music course - despite having GCSEs coming up. She will also enjoy the freedom of not having to get up for school, and reading whatever books she wants, Tanith adds. Her own summer holidays playing in the garden, making huts, and playing Cowboys and Indians, formed some of the happiest memories of her childhood. ""I think in their panic and fear about the future, parents are forgetting that some of the best learning is done through play and getting to know the physical world outside in nature. ""They are forgetting that children used to have two educations. The one they had at school and the one they had from nature."" Father-of-three and author of the Idle Parent, Tom Hodgkinson, spent his summer holidays roaming freely round parks and over rubbish dumps. He may not prescribe rubbish dumps to children today, but does believe in giving them the space to make fire, climb trees and play with knives. ""It's about responsible neglect,"" he says. ""Leave children alone - you're nearby but let them get on with it."" Life is overscheduled so the summer holidays should be a time to live in the moment, have fun and be creative without an authority figure lurking in the background, he says. It teaches you self-sufficiency, the ability to entertain yourself and how to look after yourself. ""These skills may not be useful in corporate life or if you want to suck on the nipple of the state but they are if you want to be a responsible grown-up human being,"" he argues. However, this summer he won't practise what he preaches. His eldest has A-levels next year so it will be Latin every morning. ""It's a one-off,"" he says. ""You do have to work sometimes.""

"Police began searching a Cambridge landfill site for Corrie Mckeague in March An airman who disappeared 10 months ago was ""known to sleep in rubbish on a night out"", police have said. Corrie Mckeague, 23, has not been seen since a night out in Bury St Edmunds last September, when CCTV showed him entering a bin loading bay. Suffolk Police has confirmed its search of waste at Milton landfill was at an end. Mr Mckeague's family say they are ""devastated"" at the news and disputed claims he would have slept in a bin. Live updates: Reaction following Corrie Mckeague press conference The tortuous search for Corrie Mckeague This video can not be played Det Supt Katie Elliott, of Suffolk Police, spoke at a press conference in Martlesham, near Ipswich. Police said all the information ""points to the fact Corrie was transported to the landfill"". Det Supt Katie Elliott said the landfill search for Mr Mckeague had been ""systematic, comprehensive and thorough"". She said: ""Corrie had been known to go to sleep in rubbish on a night out. There is no evidence to support any other explanation at this time."" Corrie Mckeague's girlfriend April Oliver (centre) announced the birth of their baby daughter on Father's Day Responding to the news, Corrie's father Martin Mckeague posted a statement on his Facebook page saying: ""The McKeague family in Scotland is devastated by today's announcement. ""At no point did we think that the search of the site would end this way, and as all the evidence tells us that Corrie is somewhere in that landfill site, we are heartbroken at the thought that we may not be able to bring Corrie home together."" His mother Nicola Urquhart said: ""I have tried really to put my trust in them (the police) but to say I am devastated that they are now saying they think he is still in there but they are going to stop searching, I cannot begin to explain how that makes me feel."" She said she did not believe there was evidence he slept in bins and was ""angry"" at the claim. This video can not be played Corrie Mckeague: RAF airman's movements in Bury St Edmunds Det Supt Elliott said police had spoken to one witness who had previously found Mr Mckeague asleep in a bin and he had been known to previously sleep on park benches, in toilets and stair wells. Although material from the time and place of Mr Mckeague's disappearance has been found at the landfill, the serviceman, from Dunfermline, Fife, has not been discovered. In June, Mr Mckeague's girlfriend April Oliver, from Norfolk, gave birth to their daughter. The police investigation had established early on that Mr Mckeague's mobile phone tracked the same route, and at the same pace, as a bin lorry on the night of his disappearance. But initial inquiries found the rubbish truck was carrying a load of 11kg (1st 10lb), suggesting Mr Mckeague was not on the refuse truck. Then in March it emerged the true weight of the truck contents was more than 100kg (15st 10lb). The error was a ""genuine mistake"", Suffolk Police said. This video can not be played Corrie Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, spoke of her anguish as the search for the airman was ended Corrie's mother, Nicola Urquhart, said the initial assurance from police that he was not in the bin lorry had been ""the one thing that was giving me hope that he was still alive"". Police say they will now search previously incinerated waste and carry out a review of the investigation for any fresh leads in the case.

"Emma Watson spoke of what it meant to lose a ring gifted by her mother, prompting others to share their stories of missing valuables We may each possess something which simply cannot be replaced. When actor Emma Watson lost one such item - a ring gifted by her mother - following a London spa visit, shelaunched an online appeal,externalto help find it.

"Actress Halle Berry surprised film fans by appearing to drink half a pint of whiskey in one go on stage. The Oscar winner was promoting her latest film, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, which features a fictional bourbon that serves as a business front for US secret agents. When it was produced at the Comic-Con event, Berry was poured a large glass which she initially ignored. But when a fan asked her a difficult question, she chose to drink it. What was the tough question? She was asked whether her action spy film - which also stars Colin Firth and Taron Egerton - was more British than James Bond. What happened on the first day of Comic-Con 2017? What you should look out for at Comic-Con this weekend When Berry said she'd rather drink the whiskey than answer, panel moderator Jonathan Ross led a chant encouraging her to ""chug"" it. ""Oh I can you know, would you like to see that?"" Berry replied and then downed the drink while grimacing and pretended to fall off her chair. ""Kingsman would like to remind you to drink responsibly,"" Ross said afterwards, adding: ""She's a professional, she can handle it."" Here's how it happened in pictures. Channing Tatum poured Halle Berry a glass of the fictional Statesman Reserve He poured a really big glass Bottoms up Down in one A little worse for wear Possibly regretting it now After the panel, Berry was asked if it was real bourbon she drank. ""Let that be a mystery to the world,"" shetold Entertainment Tonight,external. ""Never dare a girl like me to do anything, because I just take the challenge."" The sequel to Matthew Vaughn's 2014 film, about the recruitment of a young secret agent, was the first big film to kick off Comic-Con in the San Diego Convention Centre's famous Hall H. The film's other stars including Egerton, Firth, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Pedro Pascal were on hand to talk about the movie and give fans a sneak peek of new footage. As well as alonger trailer,externalwhich was released just ahead of the panel, three clips were shown - the opening sequence, the introduction of Tatum as Statesman agent Tequila (the American equivalent to the Kingsmen), and the introduction of Julianne Moore as Poppy, the film's villain. The stars also revealed more about their characters, with Tatum saying he ""was begging"" to have a part in the sequel as he was a fan of the franchise. Berry said her character, Ginger Ale, was ""kind of the techy, brain, nerdy character"", while Firth kept tight-lipped about his role. Fans of Kingsmen will know the Oscar winner didn't make it to the end of the first film alive, although he appears in the sequel. ""It's all a mystery to me, really. I mean, I'm in the trailer! I seem to do a lot of shaving and, that's really all I can say,"" he said. The film is released in cinemas in September.

"Faizah Shaheen was reported to authorities on her honeymoon flight to Turkey A British woman says she is being forced to go to court to get an apology after she was questioned by counter-terrorism police for reading a Syrian art book on a plane. Faizah Shaheen was reported to authorities by Thomson cabin crew on a honeymoon flight to Turkey in 2016. Her lawyers told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeshe believes she was singled out because of her race. Thomson said its crew were ""trained to report any concerns"" as a precaution. Ms Shaheen - a Muslim, whose work in mental health care in part involves looking for the signs of radicalisation in young people - was reading Syria Speaks: Art and Culture from the Frontline on the outbound flight. The book is a collection of literature, photos, songs and cartoons from Syrian artists and writers. She was stopped by police when she returned to the UK two weeks later. Ms Shaheen and her husband were taken to a room at Doncaster Airport for questioning under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. She said the interrogation lasted around 30 minutes, during which she was asked about the book, her work and the number of languages she spoke. ""I felt upset and distressed, followed by anger. I struggled to accept that I was being singled out for reading a book on art and culture,"" she explained. ""One year on, Thomson Airways has failed to provide an explanation or apology despite legal involvement. ""This attitude has left me with no option but to seek a declaration from the court under the Equality Act."" Ms Shaheen had been reading this book on Syrian culture Ms Shaheen's legal team said it had written to Thomson telling the company it believed she had been a victim of discrimination. It argued she believes she was singled out because of her race. Ravi Naik, of ITN solicitors, said that while Thomson had acknowledged its initial communication, it had not responded to its correspondence since January. ""The Equality Act contains strong protections against discriminatory treatment on the basis of someone's race and religion and for good reason,"" he said. ""We have asked the airline to apologise, to which we have never received a meaningful reply."" Ms Shaheen was stopped and examined under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 Ms Shaheen said she does not desire compensation, but ""an apology and explanation from Thomson Airways to ensure that it never happens again"". Jo Glanville, director of English PEN - a British free speech organisation who helped fund the book Ms Shaheen was reading - said Thomson's actions amounted to ""a fundamental violation of our liberty, undermining our freedom to read any text we like in a public place"". She added: ""Thomson should review its staff training procedures so that such an error never happens again. Reading a book should never be viewed as grounds for suspicious behaviour."" Thomson said in a statement: ""We're really sorry if Ms Shaheen remains unhappy with how she feels she was treated. ""We wrote to her to explain that our crew undergo general safety and security awareness training on a regular basis. ""As part of this they are encouraged to be vigilant and share any information or questions with the relevant authorities, who would then act as appropriate.""

"This is the story of the man who migrated twice. Who dodged the police along the Italian border with France - twice. Avoided officials on the train to Paris - twice. Made it to the shanty town life in Calais - twice. Risked death as he stowed away on a vehicle to Britain - twice. Now he waits for the British asylum process to decide whether he can stay. Yes, again, for a second time. It is a story of the determination to make it to safety - wherever that is perceived to exist - and of why Europe's migration crisis is only deepening. First the man himself. Let's call him Adam, because he doesn't want me to use his real name, and because it's a popular name in Darfur, Sudan, from where he comes. He calls himself a ""village man"". But today, in a smart well-ironed shirt, Adam looks at home here in the UK, although the UK has become anything but home for him. Adam left Darfur in 2012, made his way to Libya, and spent some years there. But as that country crumbled, he felt propelled onwards, to Europe. He followed the route so many take. Sicily to Ventimiglia in northern Italy, on to Paris, then Calais and then finally Britain. Only it was not finally. He was detained by the authorities, put into indefinite detention for four months, then released. He was then arrested again, detained this time for two months before it was decided that he should be sent back to Italy because there was a record (his fingerprints) that he had first arrived there. ""They put me in handcuffs,"" Adam says. Four officers accompanied him back to Milan and left him there. Surviving the deadliest migration route from Libya to Italy EU to curb rubber boat sales to Libya Migrant crisis: Italy threatens to shut ports 'Hipster rightâ group trying to stop rescue ships ""I stayed 10 days in Milan, on the streets."" That was when he decided to go back, first to Ventimiglia, and this time round it was harder. He says: ""The first time I was lucky. I just took the train from Ventimiglia to Paris."" But this second time was another year into Europe's migration crisis and the border was being monitored more effectively. ""I tried maybe two or three times to get to Marseille, but they sent me back again."" Finally he stepped on to the railway tracks and started walking. ""I just walked from Ventimiglia to Cannes for like eight hours."" From there to Paris again and on to Calais. It was more difficult there too. The previous year ""it was better. But this time was more difficult because many people (had) come and many police officers (were there) to stop people"". One of the back country roads into France favoured by migrants He tried ""for like 15 days, 20 days"", until he managed to crawl into a space underneath a bus. ""And I found myself in UK the second time."" One month and one day after he had been deported from Britain, he was back. But this is not the end of Adam's story. Determination, desperation, there's no one word that encapsulates fully what you find today along the trail that Adam knows so well. His analysis, that it's getting harder to cross borders, is echoed by others and this is why. Italy has become the go-to country for those seeking to come across the Mediterranean. The Turkey-Greece route is all but shut down following an agreement between the EU and Ankara. This year, more than 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy according to the United Nations. An EU-wide relocation scheme that should have taken the pressure off Italy has moved fewer than 8,000 since it launched almost two years ago. Four asylum seekers in Trento, northern Italy Rome is trying to do deals with Libya to stop the boats launching in the first place - but there's no central figure of authority in that war zone. They want other countries to open ports in the Mediterranean to migrant and rescue boats - France and others have said no. So Rome has dispersed its migrants across the country. There is growing resentment in towns and villages where people suddenly find themselves hosting others who don't speak their language. As one man in the north of Italy put it: ""I'm not against immigration, but I'm against it when it's handled like this."" The asylum process is stretched to breaking point. Shelters can't accommodate everyone. In Trento, towards the Austrian border, four men, from Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria, told how they have waited almost three years in limbo - unable to work - not knowing if their final appeal will grant them the right to remain or not. ""If I'd stayed here six months and they told me 'we are sending you back to Ghana' (then) there is no crying,"" says Ibrahim Mohammed. But after three years? ""How can you tell me to go back?"" The likelihood is they will not be deported, even if their asylum appeals fail. Few are actually sent back. Instead they are stuck, unable to work, or provide for themselves. All this - and the poor state of the Italian jobs market - explains why so many decide to move on from Italy. Nasser and his son Aladin from Sudan are trying to get from Ventimiglia in Italy to join NasserÂ¹s sister in France And with numbers growing, that is why Austria to the north and France to the west have both put in more frequent border checks. The people they are trying to stop gather every morning for a small free breakfast at a refuge in the Italian border town Ventimiglia. Among them on one day recently were Nasser and his two-year-old son Aladin from Sudan. Aladin - still in nappies - is ill and they desperately need a doctor. ""I've tried twice in the last week,"" said Nasser. ""My sister is in France waiting for us. The police sent us back."" On the small winding roads through the hills to France, the police check vehicles for stowaways before you can cross the border. They have set up camp in the olive groves up on the hillsides to keep watch for those trying to get across. Occasionally a patrolling helicopter passes overhead. For France too is ""overwhelmed"" - that's the word the new president uses - and is trying to stop people coming on to its territory. In the capital a week ago, they moved thousands off the streets around a metro station into shelters, but now another thousand are back on the streets, according to the deputy mayor, Patrick Klugman. ""What's going now today, this week, this summer, we need urgent measures. We cannot handle it by ourselves in Paris."" A migrant at Calais The French prime minister last week announced a series of new measures - cutting the time it takes to process asylum claims, ""systematically"" deporting so-called economic migrants and building more shelters to house refugees in the next two years. However, Mr Klugman says it is not enough. Only a tiny number of the hundreds of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers in Europe follow Adam for the whole of his journey and cross from Calais to the UK. We don't know how many of them do it twice. As for Adam, there is no happy ending to his story. It has been around a year since he had his last interview in his new asylum process. Since then he has been in limbo, not knowing whether he will be deported again, or this time be allowed to stay. He has a room to stay in - paid for by the government - and Â£75 a week to live off. He is not allowed to work. And he says it feels as if he is still on his journey, heading where he does not yet know. ""I have nothing to do. Just eat, sleep, nothing. Wait, wait and nothing changes."" ""Sometimes you feel it's not a life. It's better to pass away.""

"Running a men's prison is a tough job, and if you don't look like a stereotypical prison governor, part of your job is challenging people's expectations. So how does Pia Sinha do it, asks the BBC's Siobhann Tighe. ""What are youse doing here? What youse doing here?"" Over the din of HMP Risley, a prisoner shouts at us from the other side of a metal gate. He's spotted my microphone and wants to know what's going on. The governor, Pia Sinha, is showing me round but stops to chat to him. He doesn't hold back. He tells her: ""This jail's rubbish."" It's almost a year since 44-year-old Sinha took charge here. People often do a double-take when this 5ft three-quarters-of-an-inch tall Asian woman introduces herself as the governor. ""You get a lot of raised eyebrows and some people openly say: 'You're not what I expected,'"" Sinha says. It doesn't offend her. She takes it as a compliment. When she started her career in prisons almost 20 years ago, her friends were horrified. They weren't used to hearing workplace stories like the ones Sinha would tell them. Even today, she says, the atmosphere is an ""acquired taste"". She's often heckled by the prisoners, although she treats it as mere bravado. ""It can be very intimidating and unpleasant but when I walk on to the wings, I need to feel comfortable,"" she says. HMP Risley, near Warrington, Cheshire, is a men's resettlement prison, which means that prisoners here are nearing release. In late 2016, a few months after Sinha took charge of it, an inspection reportidentified a number of failures,externalat the prison. A fifth of prisoners felt unsafe, it said, and ""it was not a sufficiently respectful prison"". Siobhann Tighe's report from Risley prison can be heard onWoman's Hour, on Radio 4,  at 10:00 on Friday 21 July Catch up later on the BBC iPlayer ""It was a fair report,"" says Sinha. From her point of view it was well-timed. She wasn't in her post when the inspectors visited. Arriving afterwards meant she had a clear action plan to make improvements. ""Risley feels chaotic at times,"" Sinha admits. One of the challenges staff face are ""nearly epidemic"" levels of novel psychoactive substances (NPS), also known as ""legal highs"", including Spice. When I'm there, Sinha catches up with some of her staff. Prison officers report that three prisoners have taken Spice today, and it's not even lunchtime. No-one's died at HMP Risley from taking the drug, but there have been deaths in other jails. ""You see people under the influence of NPS just walking around and if they seem OK, you just leave them alone,"" says Sinha of the zombie-like trance the drug can induce. But often they're unwell and it's necessary to involve healthcare professionals. ""We're talking about an unknown quantity here."" Her voice trails off. Mechanisms for smuggling drugs inside are very sophisticated, she says, and staff are ""constantly battling"" a steady stream of banned substances, Sinha says. ""Constantly battling,"" she repeats. Sometimes drones are used to get drugs over the prison walls, but the guards have had some success in catching them. ""We're good at spotting drones. We're getting better and better. We've actually employed someone to just watch the skies and we're intercepting them, but it's an everyday struggle."" Prison is an environment where the unpredictable can happen at any time. Sinha's job is one of crisis management. She and her staff have to deal with self-harm, violence, bullying and antisocial behaviour. Much of the chaos can be traced back to drugs in one way or another, she says. There are even comic moments. The day before we met, I confirmed our interview on the phone but Sinha was in a rush and had to go. A prisoner was up a tree. ""This happens now and again, and we call it an 'incident at height',"" Sinha says. It was a hot day, and one man in the exercise yard didn't want to come back inside, so scaled a tree. ""There's a serious point to this because potentially it's life-threatening,"" Sinha says. So the prison went into Command Mode and specially trained staff talked him down. ""The lesson is that we need to trim the branches so it's harder to climb trees,"" says Sinha. When Sinha tours her prison she's constantly locking and unlocking gates. For prison staff, your keys and your key pouch around your waist become part of you, she says. ""This becomes an extension of your body,"" Sinha explains, jangling her keys. ""When I first started, I'd go home and I'd try to lock myself in and out of my bedroom because I was so used to doing it."" Sinha began her career as a psychologist at HMP Holloway, a woman's prison in London which closed last summer.  Since then she's worked in women's and men's prisons and institutions for young offenders. Her first governorship was the adult male prison, HMP Thorn Cross in Cheshire. As she's risen through the ranks, Sinha has spent less time with prisoners and more time managing staff. She's also learned to adapt her approach. ""Even though Thorn Cross is a male prison there was scope to use my female dominant skills,"" she says. ""It was a place where you can be creative - the focus was overtly on resettlement. But when I came to HMP Risley it was like starting again because it had a very male culture. It required masculine skills. I had to be clear in my communication. There is no room for discussion and dialogue when you're expected to give strong leadership."" Does spending all her working day in a high-security environment make her feel like a prisoner at times, rather than the one in charge? ""Yes, sometimes. You're not able to bring your mobiles into work. You can't do any personal admin during lunch breaks or quiet times. We have our own intranet, but there's limited access to the internet. It's very, very firewalled."" Prison, she says, ""shuts off the outside world, whilst the world wants to remain blissfully unaware of what happens inside"". Part of a governor's job is knowing how to deal with a bored and restless inmate who tells you that your prison is rubbish. Sinha responds by asking whether it's because he's struggling. It's not that, he insists. Where has he come from, she asks. ""I've been in loads of different jails,"" he says. ""I've done seven years before."" The governor asks him whether she can help in any way, especially as he's not working, spending all his time behind his door. Now he's polite, and turns down her offer. ""It's all right,"" he says, and then, ""Have a nice day."" Just as you would if you passed someone in the street.

"This video can not be played Nats released a video in 2015 illustrating flights coming in and out of airports in south-east England Air traffic controllers are warning that UK skies are running out of room amid a record number of flights. Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number. They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace. It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years. Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year. But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed. What would make your flight more fun? Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: ""In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly."" The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year. The government's consultation paper sets out a long-term plan for UK aviation The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets. The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are: Customer service Safety and security Global connectivity Competitive markets Supporting growth while tackling environmental impacts Innovation, technology and skills Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. ""It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK."" He said the government wanted to consult ""as widely as possible"" over the next 18 months on its new aviation strategy. ""We've got to get through the Brexit process, we've got to conclude the negotiations, we need to have new agreements with countries like the United States and Canada,"" he said. ""I'm off next week to meet with my US counterpart to talk about how we make sure that aviation across the Atlantic has a strong future with all the growth potential that's there."" Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, said the government consultation process could take between two and three years, ""so millions and millions of people will have a say in aircraft flying over their house"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Local communities are very obviously concerned about what more traffic might look like, but actually modernising [airspace] means we can keep aircraft higher for longer. ""We can have them descend more steeply than they currently do because modern aircraft are more capable than the types of aircraft that were in service when this airspace was originally designed."" The consultation paper will look at everything from the future of drone technology to baggage handling Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway. Friday also marks the start of a Â£1bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2. The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years. Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone. Nats is rolling out a new Â£600m computer system to make traffic control more efficient The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns. Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace. Nats itself is rolling out a new Â£600m computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays. What would make your flight more fun?

"The US State Department currently warns US citizens not to travel to North Korea The US is to ban its citizens from travelling to North Korea. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that the ban would be published next week in the Federal Register, to come into effect 30 days later. US officials linked the move to the death of jailed American student Otto Warmbier. Once the ban is in effect, US citizens will need special validation to travel to or within North Korea. How harsh is prison in North Korea? How did Otto Warmbier's holiday end in his death? Is it dangerous to visit North Korea? N Korea economy grows at fastest rate in 17 years Mr Warmbier travelled to North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours. He was arrested in 2016 for trying to steal a propaganda sign and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was returned to the US in a coma in June and died a week later. Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, who both operate in North Korea, revealed on Friday that they had been told of the upcoming ban by the Swedish embassy, which acts for the US as Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. Rowan Beard, of Young Pioneer Tours, told the BBC the embassy was urging all US nationals to depart immediately. He said the embassy was trying to check on the number of US tourists left in the country. Ms Nauert's statement said: ""Due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement, the Secretary has authorised a Geographical Travel Restriction on all US nationals' use of a passport to travelling through, or to North Korea. ""Once in effect, US passports will be invalid for travel to, through, and in North Korea, and individuals will be required to obtain a passport with a special validation in order to travel to or within North Korea. ""We intend to publish a notice in the Federal Register next week. ""The restriction will be implemented 30 days after publication."" Rowan Beard said that the 30-day grace period would ""give leeway for any [Americans] currently in the country as tourists or on humanitarian work"". Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours told the BBC the agency would still conduct tours and take Americans until the ban came into effect. This video can not be played Otto Warmbier, fourth from right, seen shortly before his arrest ""If their country allows them to go, we will take them,"" he said. Mr Cockerell added: ""It's unfortunate for the industry but also for North Koreans who want to know what Americans are really like."" After the death of Mr Warmbier, the China-based Young Pioneer Tours announced it would no longer take visitors from the US to the country. There has been movement towards a ban for a while in the US, which increased with the Warmbier death. In May, two congressmen introduced the North Korea Travel Control bill to cut off the foreign currency the country earns from American tourists. The House foreign affairs subcommittee is scheduled to take up the draft legislation on 27 July but it would still have to go to the Senate. So there could be an executive order. Apart from the treatment of Americans in North Korea, tension has been increasing over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. This video can not be played Take a tour of the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea This month North Koreaannounced it had successfully tested what it said was its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the latest in a series of tests in defiance of a UN ban. Its range has been disputed, but some experts said it could reach Alaska. The US and South Korea then conducted a ballistic missile drill andissued a stark warning to the North. Some are suggesting the US is using the date the ban is set to be announced - 27 July - to cloud North Korea's Victory Day on the same day. North Korea only relaxed its rules for American visitors in 2010. The state department does not keep a record of the number of American tourists. Tour operators suggest that up to 1,000 visit every year. Otto Warmbier appeared in a news conference in 2016 confessing to stealing a propaganda sign Otto Warmbier, 22, was an economics student who was arrested on 2 January 2016 and confessed to trying to take a propaganda sign from a hotel. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. In June, North Korea said he had been in a coma for a year after contracting botulism. He was flown back to the US on 13 June butdied a week later without regaining consciousness. His family rejected North Korea's version of events, saying he had been subjected to ""awful torturous mistreatment"". Yes. There are reported to be three US citizens in custody: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour in April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and was detained in May 2017 on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme.

"Emerging from a boyband is a tricky business but, so far at least, the One Direction team has made a pretty good fist of it. Zayn Malik has carved a niche in pervy electropop; Harry Styles is prog rock's new hope; Liam Payne's plumped for aspirational R&B and lovely Niall Horan is doing lovely pop ballads. So where does that leave Louis Tomlinson? He was always the underappreciated one - a quiet, benign presence in the world's biggest band. Speaking to The Observer last month, the 25-year-old acknowledged he was seen by some as ""forgettable, to a certain degree,external"". What he contributed, though, was songwriting - receiving credits on more One Direction songs than any of his bandmates. Appropriately for a former singer in a Green Day tribute act, he was the one who pushed the idea that a pop band could have guitar riffs. He might not have been directly responsible for sampling The Who's Baba O'Reilly inBest Song Ever,external, but it certainly fitted his vision for the band. ""Little things like that were really important to me,"" he tells the BBC. ""It was amazing that we were able to combine the two - absolute pop with guitar music."" One Direction sold more than 20 million albums worldwide When One Direction went on hiatus in 2015, Tomlinson admits he went a bit wild - making up for the teenage party years he lost to fame. ""It wasn't really me but I embraced it at the time,"" he says, looking back. The star dipped his toes back into the pop world last December, appearing as a guest vocalist on Steve Aoki's single,Just Hold On.,external But just as it was released, Tomlinson's mother died. Johannah Deakin, who had been diagnosed with leukaemia at the start of 2016, was only 43 years old. They had been unusually close - she was the first person he told when he lost his virginity -  and her death hit him particularly hard. Nonetheless, Tomlinson went ahead with a planned X Factor performance of Just Hold On that week (partly at her request), finding solace in people's reaction. ""I don't like to talk about it much, but I will say I've never had anything like it in my life,"" he says. ""It felt like the support went deeper than the fans - like people across the nation had my back. That was really nice. My mum would have loved that, definitely."" Louis Tomlinson with his mother Johannah at the Natural History Museum in 2015 Since that performance, Tomlinson has been hard at work in the studio and, on Friday, releases his first solo single Back To You. A duet with US pop singer Bebe Rexha, it's a brooding pop concoction about returning to a relationship that ""stresses me out"". The 25-year-old told the BBC how the song came about, what it felt like to leave One Direction, and how the Arctic Monkeys' lyrics influenced his debut album. We're speaking 12 hours before your single comes out. How do you feel? I'm nervous - but less than I was three weeks ago. I've got a lot of good feedback from people at the record label and radio stations -  but all that does really is ramp up the pressure because you're hoping what they say is true. And now you'll find out whether they were lying all along. I will finally know. Exactly! I was curious to find out why your first solo single starts with Bebe Rexha, singing the entire first verse. We recorded a version where I sang first - but you've got to do what's best by the song. With the emotion she gives it, and the way she opens up the song, it always had to be her, really. The video for Back To You was shot at Doncaster Rovers Football Club - where he has played on a non-contract basis The lyrics are pretty gritty. Do you think that might surprise people? My whole mission with this album is to not write these Hollywood-esque songs that talk about some unfathomable crazy love story. I'm so bored of that. Because I'm from up north, I grew up loving the likes of the Arctic Monkeys and Oasis. And the way they tell stories is such an effortless thing. It's real, it's honest and it's to the point, you know? Now, any of the Arctic Monkeys would be devastated to hear me talking like this, but there is a way of incorporating that conversational honesty into pop. So what have you been writing about on the album? There's one song I'm really attached to called Just Like You, which is all about this view of celebrities that we're impenetrable and almost not human, but fundamentally we all have the same problems. Heartbreak feels the same, loss feels the same, all these feelings are the same for all of us. Mine just look a load different to, maybe, Tom who works in the chippy from nine to five. I noticed that all the artwork was shot in Doncaster. Well, we did the video for Back To You in Doncaster, which was amazing. I mean, I'm just the biggest advocate of Doncaster in the world, I'd say. OK then, sell Doncaster to me in two linesâ¦ If you're not from there it's difficult to explain - but if you wanted to completely embrace a fully fun working class night out, then you go to Doncaster. What did Bebe Rexha make of the city? She was great. She thought it was cool. I did hear her team ask for sushi at lunch, which struck me as naive in Doncaster. Did you not take her for a curry chip? I didn't but I really should have! There's a great chippy round the corner from where we filmed, as well. The star is reportedly worth Â£40m Your last performance with One Direction was on the X Factor in 2015.  Did you wake up the next morning thinking: ""I'm free!""? Oh no - it was a very emotional time. It was a really weird feeling, because [the break] is by no means definitive, so it leaves you in a place where you're like, ""OK, what comes next?"" What did you get offered? Film work, modelling contracts, presenting? I'm not very good at fashion but there were a few TV opportunities. But unless you are someone like Harry - who is immensely talented in so many different areas - I think it's really important to stay in your lane and do what you do well. Having said that, the idea of acting sounds quite exciting to me. The idea of playing the ultimate rough chavvy - it's like me being everyone I always wanted to be in Doncaster! But I'd rather get the music 100% right, rather than 90% right while trying to dip my toe in something else. The singer says he wants to make fans more appreciative of lyrics What are your plans for the album? Ideally it's coming at the end of this year, but I don't want to put myself under too many time constraints and end up in a position where I have to put two fillers on it. How many songs have you written altogether? I'd say about 50. It's a lot of work. Have you got them all on a phone somewhere? Yeah! There's a couple of songs that me and my girlfriend [fashion blogger Eleanor Calder] really like that'll never be used for anything, so they're kind of just for us. That's really nice. Are they ones you've written for her? A lot of the album's about her, really. I wanted to make the album feel chronological, because that's how I wrote it. You can hear my journey as an individual over these three years - leaving the band, then going out on to the really crazy party scene, and then I've kind of ended up full circle back with Eleanor, who I love dearly. Not many people put that much thought into an album these days. It's usually just a collection of potential singles. Then a lot of people are missing a point. Like I said to my best mate, Olly, I want there to be songs on the album that I could play to your mum, and she could listen to it and take something away from it. Maybe she doesn't love the song, but lyrically she'll understand something about me. This is something that - for me, anyway - it doesn't feel like we have enough of. A lot of artists use words because they sound nice, or because it works for the science of the song. Again, that's why bands like Arctic Monkeys are so great. They don't work on any script or any maths or science. They just say what they feel. If it doesn't rhyme, it doesn't matter. If it sounds awkward, it doesn't matter. I think, especially with being lucky enough to have a big fanbase, I want to say to them, ""Look, lyrics actually matter, and I want to show you why"".

"The 16 students had to return home with toys they were taking for children in India A group of students have been sent back to the UK after Indian officials said they had the wrong kind of visa to visit a charity they were supporting. The 16 students and three staff were refused entry at Chennai Airport by immigration staff even though the school had made three previous visits. Poynton High School head teacher David Waugh said the school and local community was ""shocked and saddened"". Nobody from the Indian High Commission was available for comment. The school said airport officials claimed the group had no rights to enter the country on their visa because they were going to be undertaking work with a non-governmental organisation. The group had to return home with the toys and other items it was taking to the children in India. Mr Waugh said: ""They were going to play with the children they have helped and paint a mural. ""The staff and students are in a state of tired shock having travelled for 48 hours as a round trip."" Mr Waugh said he had contacted the Indian High Commission to complain but it had just referred him to its website. He said the Foreign Office is now pursuing the issue with the Indian Government. The school has raised more than Â£27,000 since 2005 for a small charity based in Macclesfield called India Direct which has supported building and running two children's homes in India. India Direct was set up after the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. The charity said: ""Our hearts go out to this great team of staff and students, who have already made a real difference, and who must be so disappointed.""

"The US State Department currently warns US citizens not to travel to North Korea The US is to ban its citizens from travelling to North Korea. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that the ban would be published next week in the Federal Register, to come into effect 30 days later. US officials linked the move to the death of jailed American student Otto Warmbier. Once the ban is in effect, US citizens will need special validation to travel to or within North Korea. How harsh is prison in North Korea? How did Otto Warmbier's holiday end in his death? Is it dangerous to visit North Korea? N Korea economy grows at fastest rate in 17 years Mr Warmbier travelled to North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours. He was arrested in 2016 for trying to steal a propaganda sign and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was returned to the US in a coma in June and died a week later. Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, who both operate in North Korea, revealed on Friday that they had been told of the upcoming ban by the Swedish embassy, which acts for the US as Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. Rowan Beard, of Young Pioneer Tours, told the BBC the embassy was urging all US nationals to depart immediately. He said the embassy was trying to check on the number of US tourists left in the country. Ms Nauert's statement said: ""Due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement, the Secretary has authorised a Geographical Travel Restriction on all US nationals' use of a passport to travelling through, or to North Korea. ""Once in effect, US passports will be invalid for travel to, through, and in North Korea, and individuals will be required to obtain a passport with a special validation in order to travel to or within North Korea. ""We intend to publish a notice in the Federal Register next week. ""The restriction will be implemented 30 days after publication."" Rowan Beard said that the 30-day grace period would ""give leeway for any [Americans] currently in the country as tourists or on humanitarian work"". Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours told the BBC the agency would still conduct tours and take Americans until the ban came into effect. This video can not be played Otto Warmbier, fourth from right, seen shortly before his arrest ""If their country allows them to go, we will take them,"" he said. Mr Cockerell added: ""It's unfortunate for the industry but also for North Koreans who want to know what Americans are really like."" After the death of Mr Warmbier, the China-based Young Pioneer Tours announced it would no longer take visitors from the US to the country. There has been movement towards a ban for a while in the US, which increased with the Warmbier death. In May, two congressmen introduced the North Korea Travel Control bill to cut off the foreign currency the country earns from American tourists. The House foreign affairs subcommittee is scheduled to take up the draft legislation on 27 July but it would still have to go to the Senate. So there could be an executive order. Apart from the treatment of Americans in North Korea, tension has been increasing over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. This video can not be played Take a tour of the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea This month North Koreaannounced it had successfully tested what it said was its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the latest in a series of tests in defiance of a UN ban. Its range has been disputed, but some experts said it could reach Alaska. The US and South Korea then conducted a ballistic missile drill andissued a stark warning to the North. Some are suggesting the US is using the date the ban is set to be announced - 27 July - to cloud North Korea's Victory Day on the same day. North Korea only relaxed its rules for American visitors in 2010. The state department does not keep a record of the number of American tourists. Tour operators suggest that up to 1,000 visit every year. Otto Warmbier appeared in a news conference in 2016 confessing to stealing a propaganda sign Otto Warmbier, 22, was an economics student who was arrested on 2 January 2016 and confessed to trying to take a propaganda sign from a hotel. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. In June, North Korea said he had been in a coma for a year after contracting botulism. He was flown back to the US on 13 June butdied a week later without regaining consciousness. His family rejected North Korea's version of events, saying he had been subjected to ""awful torturous mistreatment"". Yes. There are reported to be three US citizens in custody: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour in April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and was detained in May 2017 on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme.

"Mr Gove says leaving the EU will allow Britiain to reform how it cares for the environment Farm subsidies will have to be earned rather than just handed out in future, the Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said in a speech. Farmers will only get payouts if they agree to protect the environment and enhance rural life, he will say. The move is part of what he calls his vision for a ""green Brexit"". Farmersâ leaders want the current Â£3bn total to be spent on the environment, more infrastructure to develop farm businesses, and promoting British food. The government has promised to keep overall payments at the same level until 2022. The Tenant Farmers' Association - which represents tenant farmers in England and Wales - has called for the same amount of money to remain after that time. What happens next for the UK's farmers? Government guarantee for post-EU funds 'Industrial' farms should lose subsidies Under the EU's current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farmers are paid based on the amount of land they farm. However, in a speech at WWF's Living Planet Centre in Woking on Friday, Mr Gove said the current system will be abolished after the UK has left the EU. He criticised the current system for giving money to some of the UK's wealthiest landowners, for encouraging wastage, and for not recognising ""good environmental practice"". Mr Gove described Brexit as ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reform how we care for our land, our rivers and our seas, how we recast our ambition for our countryâs environment, and the planet"". Critics say under the CAP wealthy UK landowners are given subsidies of up to Â£3m a year. The issue was highlighted last year when BBC News revealed that taxpayers are paying more than Â£400,000 a year to subsidise a farm where abillionaire Saudi prince breeds racehorses. The Newmarket farm of Khalid Abdullah al Saud - owner of the legendary horse Frankel - is among the top recipients of farm grants, along with the Queen. Environmentalists will applaud the promise of change; they blame the CAP for the huge loss of wildlife in the British countryside. The question for Mr Gove will be what detailed policy takes its place. The Environment Secretary says that CAP puts resources in the hands of the already wealthy Mr Gove said in his speech: âThere are very good reasons why we should provide support for agriculture. Seventy per cent of our land is farmed - beautiful landscape has not happened by accident but has been actively managed. âAgriculture is an industry more susceptible to outside shocks and unpredictable events - whether itâs the weather or disease. So financial assistance and mechanisms which can smooth out the vicissitudes farmers face make sense."" He also expressed a desire to protect the âhuman ecologyâ of Britainâs highlands, where farming without subsidy is impossible. This wonât please radical environmentalists, who want Mr Gove to save money (and in their view enhance the environment) by letting sheep farming wither, and allowing the uplands to revert to natural forest. The Country Land and Business Association, known as the CLA, accepts the need for reform and has launched a plan for a land management contract. Ross Murray, president of the CLA - which represents owners of land, property and businesses in England and Wales - said there is ""vital work to be done"", including to support farming practices, to manage soils and preserve land. When pressed on whether rich landowners should received public money, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was open to change but practices such as tree planting - which are good for the environment but provide landowners with little benefit - should still be recognised. Asked if farming subsidies could be reduced in the future, he added: ""In the long term perhaps, but in the meantime I think we're going to have to support farmers who provide public goods which could never be provided by the market."" Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the speech, but said: âCurrent EU rules aimed at tackling air pollution and climate change and protecting our birds, bees and nature must not be watered down, and mechanisms must be put in place to enforce them post-Brexit."" National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Meurig Raymond said that, after leaving the EU, ""it is important that we see a broad and innovative range of measures to ensure farmers continue to deliver all the benefits - for our wellbeing, for our economy and for our environment - that the country enjoys"". He added: ""Such a policy needs to be comprehensive, providing support to farmers not just for environmental work, but also to manage risk and volatility, and to improve productivity and resilience among farming businesses."" One crucial question will be who has the final say on proposed developments in the UK's prime wildlife sites. At the moment they are protected by the EU as part of Europe's common heritage. That protection may disappear after Brexit.

"A record number of school exclusions were issued to pupils last year for drug and alcohol related issues, new statistics reveal. Figures show 9,250 permanent and fixed period exclusions for drugs and alcohol were handed out by schools in 2015-16. A further 2,140 exclusions were issued to pupils for sexual misconduct. The government says every child should ""have access to a good school place where they can learn without disruption and feel safe"". The figures published by theDepartment for Education,external, and analysed by BBC News show an increase over the past decade in the number of exclusions being issued for drugs and alcohol in state-funded schools. In the last academic year 9,250 permanent and fixed period exclusions were issued for substance offences compared to 8,580 in 2006-07. Charly from Sheffield says without help she would have ended up in prison, after being excluded from school Yorkshire and Humber has the highest rate of fixed period exclusions in the country, with more than 50,000 exclusions handed out to children in 2015-16, for a variety of reasons. Local charities are working with schools to try and give those children excluded from school a second chance. Teenager Charly, who has been working with the charity In2Change in Sheffield, said: ""I got kicked out of three schools because I used to hit teachers and students. ""I was constantly in trouble with the police and to be honest I was like violent dog. ""Without coming here I'd be in prison."" As the school population has grown, the number of drug and alcohol exclusions is also at its highest rate since 2010. Drug charities say schools need to place a greater emphasis on teaching children and young people that taking drugs is not a ""social norm"". Michael O'Toole, of Mentor UK, said: ""We know fewer young people are using drugs but you can't just stand there and warn young people about their dangers. ""We need to get the message home that the vast majority of people don't take drugs."" Overall drug usage amongst young people has been falling over the past decade. Figures from theEngland and Wales crime survey,externalshow that the number of 16-24 year olds who say they have used drugs in the last year, has fallen from 30% in 1996 to 18% in 2016. ""Schools need to make sure they have a drugs policy in place to deal with this issue but at the same time we need to make sure those children who are excluded for drug offences don't suffer in the long term,"" Mr O'Toole added. In2Change in South Yorkshire work with children and young people who have been excluded from school to turn their lives around A report from theInstitute of Public Policy Researchsuggests nearly two-thirds of the adult prison population were at some point excluded from school. Hanif Mohammed, a manager at In2Change, was kicked out of his school aged 14 and later jailed for 10 years for manslaughter. ""Working with these young people is for me partly about redemption, but I can see so much potential in these kids,"" he said. ""Part of the challenge working with these young people is to get them to realise that education can be their salvation and it can allow them to build a better life"". A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""The rules are clear that exclusion powers should only be used in particular circumstances and decisions to exclude should be lawful, reasonable and fair. ""Permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach, or persistent breaches, of the school's behaviour policy"".

"This video can not be played Alun Cairns said the tolls were a ""psychological barrier"" to doing business in Wales. Tolls on the Severn bridges between Wales and England will be scrapped by the end of 2018, the UK government has announced. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it would be a major boost to the economy. The fees paid on entry to Wales - currently from Â£6.70 to Â£20 a vehicle - have long been a source of contention with motorists and businesses. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he was ""suspicious about the timing"" and ""their genuine commitment to it"". About 25 million journeys are made across the two bridges annually. Those using the bridge daily could save about Â£1,400 a year. Astudy commissioned by the Welsh Government,externalsuggested the removal of tolls would boost the Welsh economy by Â£100m. However,another report,external, for UK ministers, predicted just halving the tolls would mean a 17% increase in traffic along the M4 and surrounding areas either side of the crossings. But it did not indicate the impact on traffic by scrapping the tolls completely. The Welsh Government said it had looked at the impact of scrapping the tolls as part of preparation for the public inquiry into plans for an M4 relief road around Newport. ""Our modelling shows that immediately adjacent to the Second Severn Crossing traffic levels would increase by around 20%,"" a spokesman said. ""At the Brynglas tunnels [in Newport] this would filter down to around 7%, and dropping to a 2% increase before Cardiff."" Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales: ""There will be issues around congestion, and I have raised this personally with the first minister on more than one occasion. ""Of course, we are doing all we can to make the money available to the Welsh Government to build a motorway around Newport; that money has been available for more than three years and it has not been spent yet. ""But we understand they are obviously pressing ahead with their inquiry, and we want to see that road built as quickly as possible."" Mr Cairns said Bristol and south Wales would also be ""bound together"" by improved rail links. This video can not be played Ken Skates said it was ""a cynical attempt to stop bad news"" over rail electrification But First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,external: ""This is nothing but a desperate attempt by Alun Cairns to distract fromyesterday's U-turn on electrification to Swansea."" Mr Skates later told BBC Radio Wales: ""They need to boost confidence in themselves again amongst the people of south Wales and the only way they are going to do that is making good on this promise."" Mr Cairns said the decision to abolish the tolls ""sends a powerful message to businesses, commuters and tourists alike that the UK government is committed to strengthening the Welsh economy"". He said: ""I want to ensure that visitors and investors know what Wales has to offer socially, culturally and economically. ""Most importantly, I want the world to know how accessible we are to business."" Some politicians are concerned that ending the tolls could increase congestion Phil Bell, executive director of Chepstow racecourse, said the scrapping of the tolls would boost its fortunes. ""We have millions of people who would potentially come to the racecourse from just the other side of the bridge,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""At the moment we have about 9% of our customers come from the Bristol area and we have around 100,000 racegoers a year so we expect to see significant increases in that number. ""I am asking our board of directors to invest in the infrastructure at the racecourse and upgrade the facilities, so this decision will aid my case."" Labour Newport East MP Jessica Morden said it was a ""relief that, after years of pressure, the Tory government has finally listened"". ""For far too long, commuters and businesses in Newport East and beyond have had to absorb the extortionate toll charges."" People had a chance to walk along the original Severn Bridge after it was opened in 1966 However Llanelli Labour AM Lee Waters warned the ending of the tolls would in reality result in more misery for drivers because ""everybody expects there will be more people using their cars"". ""The Department for Transport's best guess - and nobody really knows - is the amount of traffic will go up somewhere between 12 and 20 percent,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""So that'll be a significant extra amount of traffic which will create congestion and delays."" The two crossings are currently owned and run by a private consortium but will revert to Highways England once the cost of building the second crossing, opened in 1996, is repaid. Ministers will then scrap the tolls. Abolishing the charges was included in every major party's manifesto in June's general election. Prime Minister Theresa May said during the campaign that their removal would significantly reduce the cost of doing business between Wales and England and help support the Union. The tolls have been in place since the first Severn bridge was opened in 1966, when the fee was two shillings and sixpence (12.5p).

"The Times reveals that a woman will become Britain's top judge for the first time. It says Lady Hale of Richmond is expected to be confirmed,externalas the next president of the Supreme Court.

It points out that some of her comments have made headlines, most notably last year when she said the prevalence of what she called ""boring old farts"" in the judiciary meant there was more consistency in court rulings. Many of the papers continue to focus on the fallout from the BBC's publication of presenters' wages. The front page headline in the Daily Mail,externalis ""shameless BBC stars are still dodging their tax"".

"Emerging from a boyband is a tricky business but, so far at least, the One Direction team has made a pretty good fist of it. Zayn Malik has carved a niche in pervy electropop; Harry Styles is prog rock's new hope; Liam Payne's plumped for aspirational R&B and lovely Niall Horan is doing lovely pop ballads. So where does that leave Louis Tomlinson? He was always the underappreciated one - a quiet, benign presence in the world's biggest band. Speaking to The Observer last month, the 25-year-old acknowledged he was seen by some as ""forgettable, to a certain degree,external"". What he contributed, though, was songwriting - receiving credits on more One Direction songs than any of his bandmates. Appropriately for a former singer in a Green Day tribute act, he was the one who pushed the idea that a pop band could have guitar riffs. He might not have been directly responsible for sampling The Who's Baba O'Reilly inBest Song Ever,external, but it certainly fitted his vision for the band. ""Little things like that were really important to me,"" he tells the BBC. ""It was amazing that we were able to combine the two - absolute pop with guitar music."" One Direction sold more than 20 million albums worldwide When One Direction went on hiatus in 2015, Tomlinson admits he went a bit wild - making up for the teenage party years he lost to fame. ""It wasn't really me but I embraced it at the time,"" he says, looking back. The star dipped his toes back into the pop world last December, appearing as a guest vocalist on Steve Aoki's single,Just Hold On.,external But just as it was released, Tomlinson's mother died. Johannah Deakin, who had been diagnosed with leukaemia at the start of 2016, was only 43 years old. They had been unusually close - she was the first person he told when he lost his virginity -  and her death hit him particularly hard. Nonetheless, Tomlinson went ahead with a planned X Factor performance of Just Hold On that week (partly at her request), finding solace in people's reaction. ""I don't like to talk about it much, but I will say I've never had anything like it in my life,"" he says. ""It felt like the support went deeper than the fans - like people across the nation had my back. That was really nice. My mum would have loved that, definitely."" Louis Tomlinson with his mother Johannah at the Natural History Museum in 2015 Since that performance, Tomlinson has been hard at work in the studio and, on Friday, releases his first solo single Back To You. A duet with US pop singer Bebe Rexha, it's a brooding pop concoction about returning to a relationship that ""stresses me out"". The 25-year-old told the BBC how the song came about, what it felt like to leave One Direction, and how the Arctic Monkeys' lyrics influenced his debut album. We're speaking 12 hours before your single comes out. How do you feel? I'm nervous - but less than I was three weeks ago. I've got a lot of good feedback from people at the record label and radio stations -  but all that does really is ramp up the pressure because you're hoping what they say is true. And now you'll find out whether they were lying all along. I will finally know. Exactly! I was curious to find out why your first solo single starts with Bebe Rexha, singing the entire first verse. We recorded a version where I sang first - but you've got to do what's best by the song. With the emotion she gives it, and the way she opens up the song, it always had to be her, really. The video for Back To You was shot at Doncaster Rovers Football Club - where he has played on a non-contract basis The lyrics are pretty gritty. Do you think that might surprise people? My whole mission with this album is to not write these Hollywood-esque songs that talk about some unfathomable crazy love story. I'm so bored of that. Because I'm from up north, I grew up loving the likes of the Arctic Monkeys and Oasis. And the way they tell stories is such an effortless thing. It's real, it's honest and it's to the point, you know? Now, any of the Arctic Monkeys would be devastated to hear me talking like this, but there is a way of incorporating that conversational honesty into pop. So what have you been writing about on the album? There's one song I'm really attached to called Just Like You, which is all about this view of celebrities that we're impenetrable and almost not human, but fundamentally we all have the same problems. Heartbreak feels the same, loss feels the same, all these feelings are the same for all of us. Mine just look a load different to, maybe, Tom who works in the chippy from nine to five. I noticed that all the artwork was shot in Doncaster. Well, we did the video for Back To You in Doncaster, which was amazing. I mean, I'm just the biggest advocate of Doncaster in the world, I'd say. OK then, sell Doncaster to me in two linesâ¦ If you're not from there it's difficult to explain - but if you wanted to completely embrace a fully fun working class night out, then you go to Doncaster. What did Bebe Rexha make of the city? She was great. She thought it was cool. I did hear her team ask for sushi at lunch, which struck me as naive in Doncaster. Did you not take her for a curry chip? I didn't but I really should have! There's a great chippy round the corner from where we filmed, as well. The star is reportedly worth Â£40m Your last performance with One Direction was on the X Factor in 2015.  Did you wake up the next morning thinking: ""I'm free!""? Oh no - it was a very emotional time. It was a really weird feeling, because [the break] is by no means definitive, so it leaves you in a place where you're like, ""OK, what comes next?"" What did you get offered? Film work, modelling contracts, presenting? I'm not very good at fashion but there were a few TV opportunities. But unless you are someone like Harry - who is immensely talented in so many different areas - I think it's really important to stay in your lane and do what you do well. Having said that, the idea of acting sounds quite exciting to me. The idea of playing the ultimate rough chavvy - it's like me being everyone I always wanted to be in Doncaster! But I'd rather get the music 100% right, rather than 90% right while trying to dip my toe in something else. The singer says he wants to make fans more appreciative of lyrics What are your plans for the album? Ideally it's coming at the end of this year, but I don't want to put myself under too many time constraints and end up in a position where I have to put two fillers on it. How many songs have you written altogether? I'd say about 50. It's a lot of work. Have you got them all on a phone somewhere? Yeah! There's a couple of songs that me and my girlfriend [fashion blogger Eleanor Calder] really like that'll never be used for anything, so they're kind of just for us. That's really nice. Are they ones you've written for her? A lot of the album's about her, really. I wanted to make the album feel chronological, because that's how I wrote it. You can hear my journey as an individual over these three years - leaving the band, then going out on to the really crazy party scene, and then I've kind of ended up full circle back with Eleanor, who I love dearly. Not many people put that much thought into an album these days. It's usually just a collection of potential singles. Then a lot of people are missing a point. Like I said to my best mate, Olly, I want there to be songs on the album that I could play to your mum, and she could listen to it and take something away from it. Maybe she doesn't love the song, but lyrically she'll understand something about me. This is something that - for me, anyway - it doesn't feel like we have enough of. A lot of artists use words because they sound nice, or because it works for the science of the song. Again, that's why bands like Arctic Monkeys are so great. They don't work on any script or any maths or science. They just say what they feel. If it doesn't rhyme, it doesn't matter. If it sounds awkward, it doesn't matter. I think, especially with being lucky enough to have a big fanbase, I want to say to them, ""Look, lyrics actually matter, and I want to show you why"".

"This video can not be played Nats released a video in 2015 illustrating flights coming in and out of airports in south-east England Air traffic controllers are warning that UK skies are running out of room amid a record number of flights. Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number. They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace. It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years. Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year. But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed. What would make your flight more fun? Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: ""In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly."" The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year. The government's consultation paper sets out a long-term plan for UK aviation The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets. The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are: Customer service Safety and security Global connectivity Competitive markets Supporting growth while tackling environmental impacts Innovation, technology and skills Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. ""It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK."" He said the government wanted to consult ""as widely as possible"" over the next 18 months on its new aviation strategy. ""We've got to get through the Brexit process, we've got to conclude the negotiations, we need to have new agreements with countries like the United States and Canada,"" he said. ""I'm off next week to meet with my US counterpart to talk about how we make sure that aviation across the Atlantic has a strong future with all the growth potential that's there."" Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, said the government consultation process could take between two and three years, ""so millions and millions of people will have a say in aircraft flying over their house"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Local communities are very obviously concerned about what more traffic might look like, but actually modernising [airspace] means we can keep aircraft higher for longer. ""We can have them descend more steeply than they currently do because modern aircraft are more capable than the types of aircraft that were in service when this airspace was originally designed."" The consultation paper will look at everything from the future of drone technology to baggage handling Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway. Friday also marks the start of a Â£1bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2. The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years. Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone. Nats is rolling out a new Â£600m computer system to make traffic control more efficient The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns. Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace. Nats itself is rolling out a new Â£600m computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays. What would make your flight more fun?

"This video can not be played It's the first news conference Police Chief Janee Harteau has held since the fatal shooting The fatal shooting of an Australian woman by a Minneapolis police officer ""should not have happened"", the city's police chief has said. Justine Damond, originally from Sydney, was shot when she approached a police car after reporting a suspected rape. A lawyer for Ms Damond's family has called it""ludicrous""to suggest the two officers inside feared an ambush. Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau said the killing was ""the actions and judgement of one individual"". Officer Mohamed Noor, who shot Ms Damond in the abdomen in an upmarket neighbourhood of the city, has refused to be interviewed by investigators, as is his legal right. Australia waits for answers in US shooting ""The actions in question go against who we are as a department, how we train and the expectations we have for our officers,"" Chief Harteau told reporters in Minneapolis. ""I want to assure Justine's family our community and those in Australia that I will do everything in my power to ensure due process is followed and justice is served."" Body cameras, which are worn by all Minneapolis police,had not been turned onat the time of the shooting and the squad car dashboard camera also failed to capture the incident. Chief Harteau said the cameras worn by Officers Noor and Matthew Harrity ""should have been activated"". Justine Damond with her fiancÃ©, Don ""An officer should have them on and that is what we are trying to identify,"" Chief Harteau said. ""We want to do everything we can in training and in our policy to ensure that they are put on before an officer arrives at the scene."" Fred Bruno, the lawyer for Officer Harrity has said: ""It is reasonable to assume an officer in that situation would be concerned about a possible ambush."" However Robert Bennett, who represents Ms Damond's family, said the yoga instructor was in her pyjamas when she approached the police and ""was not a threat to anyone"". Justine Damond's death: What we know Death raises questions about camera use Minneapolis police claim 'ludicrous' Mr Bennett told CBS News: ""I think that [the ambush fear] is ludicrous. It's disinformation. It doesn't have any basis in fact."" He added: ""She obviously wasn't armed, was not a threat to anyone, and nor could she have reasonably been perceived to be."" On Thursday, a statement from Ms Damond's family said: ""All we want to do is bring Justine home to Australia to farewell her in her hometown among family and friends. ""We are still trying to come to terms with this tragedy and we are struggling to understand how and why this could happen."" On Wednesday, police released the transcript of two separate 911 calls Ms Damond made after hearing screams nearby. ""I'm not sure if she's having sex or being raped,"" she told the police operator, before giving her address. This video can not be played Justine Damond's family held a silent vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach ""I think she just yelled out 'help', but it's difficult, the sound has been going on for a while,"" she continued. Ms Damond called back eight minutes later to ensure police had the correct address. Chief Harteau said she understood why the incident could make some people more reluctant to call 911. ""Although disheartening, I understand the fear and why it exists. This has had a negative impact on the community trust we have built,"" she said. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has said he will decide whether to charge the police officer.

"The Times reveals that a woman will become Britain's top judge for the first time. It says Lady Hale of Richmond is expected to be confirmed,externalas the next president of the Supreme Court. The paper describes her as ""clever, determined and a bit prickly"". It points out that some of her comments have made headlines, most notably last year when she said the prevalence of what she called ""boring old farts"" in the judiciary meant there was more consistency in court rulings. Many of the papers continue to focus on the fallout from the BBC's publication of presenters' wages. The front page headline in the Daily Mail,externalis ""shameless BBC stars are still dodging their tax"". The paper accuses some of the corporation's stars of having their salaries channelled into companies ""so they can avoid tax"". In its leader, the Mail argues that the BBC is ""wedded to a funding model which is both horribly antiquated, and frankly unsustainable"". TheFinancial Times,externalwades into the debate about the preponderance of men among the BBC's highest earners. Its leader says that ""for a public corporation that often investigates inequality in business and government, these are ugly headlines"". But it believes the controversy will have served a valid purpose if the disclosures lead to public discussion about the pay gap. There is a range of opinions on the story in the letters pages. One person writes tothe i newspaper,externalsaying: ""The kerfuffle about BBC salaries and gender is useless unless we have real comparisons with ITV, Sky and various other broadcasters.""

The Sun is one of several papers to comment on the appointment of Sir Vince Cable,externalas the leader of the Liberal Democrats. In its opinion column, the paper argues that the party is still recovering from its U-turn on university tuitions fees when it formed part of the coalition government.

"Cows have shown an ""insane"" and ""mind-blowing"" ability to tackle HIV which will help develop a vaccine, say US researchers. In a first for immunisation, the animals rapidly produced special types of antibody that can neutralise HIV. It is thought cows evolved a supreme immune defence due to their complex and bacteria-packed digestive system. The US National Institutes of Health said the findings were of ""great interest"". HIV is a slippery and nefarious opponent. It mutates so readily that every time a patient's immune system finds a way of attacking the virus, HIV shifts its appearance. However, a small proportion of patients eventually develop ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" after years of infection. These attack parts the virus cannot change. A vaccine that could train the immune system to make broadly neutralising antibodies should help prevent people being infected in the first place. But no jab can do the job. Then researchers at the International Aids Vaccine Initiative and the Scripps Research Institute tried immunising cows. ""The response blew our minds,"" Dr Devin Sok, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website. The required antibodies were being produced by the cow's immune system in a matter of weeks. Dr Sok added: ""It was just insane how good it looked, in humans it takes three-to-five years to develop the antibodies we're talking about. ""This is really important because we hadn't been able to do it period. ""Who would have thought cow biology was making a significant contribution to HIV."" The results,published in the journal Nature,external, showed the cow's antibodies could neutralise 20% of HIV strains within 42 days. By 381 days, they could neutralise 96% of strains tested in the lab. Dr Dennis Burton, a fellow researcher, said: ""The potent responses in this study are remarkable. ""Unlike human antibodies, cattle antibodies are more likely to bear unique features and gain an edge over HIV."" Unusually for human antibodies, the broadly neutralising ones have a long and loopy structure. Cow antibodies are inherently more long and loopy. So the cow immune system finds making the antibodies easily. It is thought the cow's ""ruminant"" digestive system which ferments grass in order to digest it is a Wild West of hostile bacteria. So the animals have developed the antibodies needed to keep them in check. It means cattle could eventually become a source of drugs to make more effective vaginal microbicides to prevent HIV infection. However, the real goal is to develop a vaccine that encourages the human immune system to make the antibodies it currently finds a struggle. That remains a significant challenge, but the cattle study could help point the way. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""From the early days of the epidemic, we have recognized that HIV is very good at evading immunity, so exceptional immune systems that naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV are of great interest - whether they belong to humans or cattle.""

"This video can not be played At least two people were killed in the tourist destination of Kos A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has killed at least two people on the Greek island of Kos, officials say. The 6.7-magnitude quake hit 12km (seven miles) north-east of Kos, near the Turkish coast, with a depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey said. On Kos, around 115 people were injured, including tourists - 12 of them seriously. Some buildings were damaged. Turkey's health minister said 358 were hurt in the Turkish city of Bodrum, but none seriously. The earthquake struck at 01:31 on Friday (22:31 GMT Thursday). The two deceased have not been named but police said that both victims were tourists - a 22-year-old from Sweden and a 39-year-old from Turkey. They died when the roof of a popular bar collapsed, police said. Dozens were wounded when buildings collapsed, some of them suffering broken bones, Kos regional government official Giorgos Halkidios said. The army is supporting the emergency services with the rescue operation, he added. Greek authorities said the 12 people seriously injured included tourists from Turkey, Sweden and Norway. Four were taken to Crete for treatment, and three to Athens. The director of the hospital in Crete told Greek Skai TV that one person was in a critical condition, while a Swedish tourist had lost a leg. The quake damaged a number of older buildings on the island of Kos Large cracks appeared on pathways near a port on Kos The Turkish foreign ministry said a ferry had been sent to evacuate 200 Turkish nationals from Kos back to Bodrum. Data from Turkey's disaster and emergency management authority, AFAD, showed that more than 40 aftershocks were felt in Turkey and Greece in the aftermath of the quake, some up to magnitude 4.6. British student Naomi Ruddock felt the earthquake in Kos, where she is on holiday with her mother. ""We were asleep and we just felt the room shaking. The room moved. Literally everything was moving. And it kind of felt like you were on a boat and it was swaying really fast from side to side, you felt seasick."" Ms Ruddock said that a staff member told her it was the worst earthquake the area had seen. ""All of a sudden it felt like a train was going right through the room,"" German tourist Vernon Hausman told Reuters. ""I told my son: 'Looks like an earthquake, so let's get the hell out of here.'"" Brits caught in 'terrifying' quake Kos was nearest to the epicentre of the quake and appeared to be the worst hit, with damage caused to a number of older buildings, including cracked walls and smashed windows. Officials say some of the damaged properties may not have been earthquake-proof Tourists headed to Kos airport after evacuating hotels and apartments The mayor said the buildings that suffered the most damage were built before ""earthquake building codes"" were introduced. ""The rest of the island has no problem. It's only the main town that has a problem,"" Mayor Giorgos Kyritsis said. Kos's port was put out of action, and a ferry was unable to dock due to damage at the harbour, Greek police said. Tourists later gathered outside terminal buildings at Kos airport having left their hotels and apartments. In Turkey, some witnesses described waking in the night after being violently shaken in their beds. Kristian Stevens, a British tourist in Didim, 90km (60 miles) from Bodrum, said the building he was in began to ""shake like a jelly"". Residents fled their homes and tourists ran from holiday apartments with pillows and blankets. Some sustained injuries after jumping from windows in panic, Turkish broadcaster NTV said. Sophie Wild, another British tourist in Turkey, said she fled her third-floor accommodation in the coastal town of Altinkum, about 40km from Bodrum (as the crow flies), when she woke to a loud banging noise. ""People were running out of rooms, banging on people's doors to make sure they were out,"" Ms Wild told the Press Association, adding: ""Everyone just ran outside."" ""It was a lucky escape and it could have been much worse,"" said Issa Kamara, 38, a personal trainer at the city's Maca Kizi hotel. At a hospital in Bodrum, the wounded were being treated in the garden as a precaution after the quake caused slight damage to parts of the hospital ceiling, theHurriyet Daily News reports,external. The earthquake also triggered high waves off Gumbet, a resort town near Bodrum, which flooded roads and left parked cars stranded, Turkish media report. There were no reports of casualties there. Cars were lifted on to curbs by high waves at the resort town of Gumbet in Turkey Turkey and Greece sit on significant fault lines and are regularly hit by earthquakes.

"Ms MartÃ­nez says she was born in 1956 as a result of an affair between DalÃ­ and her mother Forensic experts in Spain have exhumed the body of the surrealist painter Salvador DalÃ­ to extract DNA to settle a paternity case. Samples were taken from the artist's teeth, bones and nails in a four-hour operation, officials said. The exhumation followed a court order on behalf of a woman who says her mother had an affair with the painter. If she is proved right, she could assume part of the DalÃ­'s estate, currently owned by the Spanish state. It may take weeks before the results of the tests are known. The surrealist painter, who died in 1989 at the age of 85, was buried in a crypt in a museum dedicated to his life and work in Figueres, in north-eastern Spain. A crowd gathered outside the museum to watch as police escorted the experts into the building on Thursday evening. The exhumation went ahead despite the objections of the local authorities and the foundation carrying DalÃ­'s name, both of which claimed that not enough notice had been given ahead of the exhumation. A crowd gathered in front of DalÃ­'s museum MarÃ­a Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez, a tarot card reader who was born in 1956, says her mother had an affair with DalÃ­ during the year before her birth. Her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in CadaquÃ©s, near the painter's home. Last month a Madrid judge ordered the exhumation to settle the claim. It is contested by the DalÃ­ foundation, which manages the estate of the artist, who was not believed to have had any children. Her action is against the Spanish state, to which DalÃ­ left his estate. Why experts question artist paternity claim BBC Arts: What is Surrealism?
