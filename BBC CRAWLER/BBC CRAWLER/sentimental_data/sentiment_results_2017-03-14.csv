" Marine Le Pen's political awakening came at the age of eight, when she survived a bombing at her family's Paris home. Five kilograms of dynamite had been placed on the landing outside the apartment at 9 Villa Poirier.  The explosion ripped open the entire front of the building.  A baby in the next-door flat fell five floors and was saved by the branches of a tree. In her autobiography, the woman who took over the leadership of France's National Front (FN) from her father describes the chaos, the smoke and debris. She and her two sisters “were on our knees shivering, holding hands, praying with the fervour of despair… when we heard the voice of our father shouting, 'Girls, girls, are you alive?'” Bomb damage at Villa Poirier,Paris, 1976(Getty Images) The mystery of who tried to kill Jean-Marie Le Pen and his family on the night of 1 November 1976 is still unsolved. At the time the FN was just four years old, a fringe party of the far right including some on the anti-Semitic extreme. For Marine Le Pen the attack changed everything.  The family home was destroyed.  She lost school-friends, whose parents were too scared now to let them near her “dangerous” father. Jean-Marie Le Pen with daughters Yann and Marine, early 1970s(Getty Images) More profoundly she came to understand that she and her family were different - they would never be treated as normal people.  Instead of sympathy, there was hostility. Acordon sanitairewas created around us - don't go near the Le Pens.” Today Marine Le Pen is often described as having a hard exterior. “After everything she went through in her youth, she built herself a shell,” says her friend and senior FN colleague Steeve Briois. Pejorative adjectives likecassant(brittle) andclivant(divisive) are commonly applied. But at heart there is that emotional toughness, a determined self-reliance whose origins surely lie in the difficult psychological conditions of her childhood. Without that toughness, she could not have pushed the FN to its current unprecedented heights. She has battled successfully through the first round of France's presidential election and will now face centrist Emmanuel Macron in the final run-off on 7 May. And without that toughness she could certainly not have achieved the act that made that success possible - the symbolic “killing” of her father. On a Friday evening in France's rural east, Marine Le Pen has taken her election campaign to a community hall in the small town of Clairvaux-les-Lacs. Before a mainly working-class, mainly middle-aged audience of 300, she develops the themes at the heart of her party's 144-point manifesto - from prioritising jobs for French nationals to “automatic” expulsion of undocumented immigrants. FN supporters gather to hear Marine Le PenClairvaux-les-Lacs, France, February 2017(Getty Images) Marine Le Pen talks with practised confidence. In a previous life she was a lawyer who defended in the Paris courts the sort of immigrants she now wants expelled. This is her sixth year as leader of a party traditionally seen as far-right. It is also her second tilt at the presidency - she won third place with nearly 18% in 2012. That bettered anything her father achieved, even in 2002, when he came second to Jacques Chirac on an anti-immigrant, law-and-order platform. Even more is expected of her now. Watching Marine in action, you can understand the appeal. There is a hint of the “everywoman” about her. People like the lived-in, authentic persona, the sense she gives of combining hard work with the aura of someone who knows how to have a good time. A political player in France for years, her message - anti-immigration, anti-EU - is consistent and unchanged. Out here in the sticks, people adore the fact that she is so hated by the establishment in Paris. Marine owes Jean-Marie. In daughter as in father there is the same pugnacity - ready for a scrap with a hostile world. There is the same plain-speaking humour - the French call itla gouaille.To cheers, she declares: There are two things I want to give back to you, the people. Your voice... and your money!” Then there is the physical resemblance, with the strong features and the blonde hair. Marine was the third and last Le Pen daughter, and her parents may well have been hoping for a boy. Today Marine's mother Pierrette says her daughter is just like Jean-Marie with long hair. Jean-Marie himself puts it more crudely: “She is me with breasts!” But today Marine and her father are entirely estranged. The rift is not a charade to help along her political career. It is a total breakdown. The pair have not spoken for more than two years. “In this family, politics is stronger than blood,” says journalist Olivier Beaumont, author of a book on the Le Pens. “Jean-Marie could not bear to see someone else, even his own daughter, taking control of the party he had created and controlled for 40 years.” It was like a Greek tragedy unfolding, and it ended like a Greek tragedy - in a symbolic parricide.” She did an honourable thing, argues Marine's close friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “For the sake of politics and for the sake of France, she did the hardest thing a child can do - she cut the cord with her father.” The final break came in April 2015, when in an interview on French radio Jean-Marie Le Pen did what Marine had long feared he would do. He repeatedle détail. Mentionle détailto anyone in the National Front today and their face hardens.They know exactly what it means. In September 1987 a dark moment became a turning-point in the party's history. In their biography of the man, Pierre Pean and Philippe Cohen call it “the day Le Pen became Le Pen”. He was asked in an interview about a notorious Holocaust denier. Did he share the man's ideas? In his reply, the FN chief was at his ambiguous worst: “I do not say that the gas chambers did not exist. I never personally saw them. I have never particularly studied the issue, but I believe they are a point of detail in the history of World War Two.” Marine and Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2014 before their estrangement(Getty Images) Jean-Marie Le Pen never escaped from the aftershock of that remark - downplaying the Holocaust. It was a gift to his enemies, who now had evidence that the FN was anti-Semitic. Worse, Jean-Marie reacted to the hostility by digging in further. Over the years there were further verbal provocations, and he amassed more than 15 separate convictions in the courts. Then came the 2015 interview when he saidle détailall over again. Marine Le Pen looked on with horror. She disassociated herself from the remarks. Over the years she had become increasingly convinced that her father was incapable of winning power. Worse, maybe he never wanted power. In 2002 Marine had observed with satisfaction her father's first round success in the presidential race. But what left more of an impression was his utter wipe-out in round two. With just 17.8% to Jacques Chirac's 82.2%, Jean-Marie had barely made any advance at all from his first round score. Voters had united against him. Jean-Marie Le Pen's miserable result in the 2007 election (fourth place on 10.4%) set the seal on his decline. Maybe his real raison d'etre was to be a perpetual gadfly on the back of the French body politic, irritating but irrelevant. Time and again after she was elected as FN leader in 2011, Marine Le Pen would make clear her desire to “normalise” the party and make it electable. But time and again Jean-Marie grabbed the headlines with incendiary statements. After his repeat ofledétailin 2015, he was suspended by the party and soon expelled, though technically he remains its honorary president. A family-political drama had reached its climax. The very qualities he had inculcated in Marine by example - the cussedness, the pugnacity, the refusal to back down - were turned against him. Now Marine Le Pen is everywhere, and so are her lieutenants. As the presidential election draws near, Florian Philippot, Nicolas Bay, David Rachline, her partner Louis Aliot, and a handful of others saturate the morning TV talk shows. They are practised, presentable, professional. Philippot, her close adviser, has his own YouTube channel where he appears in an office kitchen dubbed the Marine cafe, railing against the latest factory closure or European free-trade deal. For years the party's far-right views were regarded by the French media as toxic, but the boycott is history. “A few years ago when I first interviewed Marine Le Pen, I got a kind of frisson with the hairs sticking up at the back of my neck. I felt I was flirting with the untouchable,” says journalist Elisabeth Levy. So is it truly a party like any other? Ask most observers, and they will say that the process ofdédiabolisation(de-demonisation) is genuine and more or less complete. Young FN supporters, 2017(Getty Images) The older generation with nostalgia for the collaborationist wartime Vichy regime, or for France's colonial rule of Algeria, has moved on. Racist comments are outlawed and people who make them are chased from the FN. In 2010, before being elected leader, Marine Le Pen was roundly criticised after comparing Muslims praying in the street to the German occupation. Now she has softened her tone, saying she does not regard Islam as “incompatible” with French democracy. The FN has also tried to build bridges with the Jewish community. Meanwhile across the West, other nationalist parties - in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere - have emerged which make the FN much less of a French exception. Events too have worked in the FN's favour. The jihadist attacks on Paris and Nice are part of it. But just as much is the popular disillusionment with the Paris and Brussels elites, and the growing fear of what they call in Francele déclassement- the loss of economic and social status. People feel poor. “We treat the FN like we would any other politicians,” says Beatrice Houchard who covers the party for L'Opinion newspaper.“No favours - but nor do we go out of our way to find something negative to say.” And with acceptance has come electoral success. After victories in municipal, European and regional elections, Marine can arguably claim to lead the country's most popular political party. Such an idea would have been laughable just a few years ago. We are now the number one party among the youth. We are the number one party for the working class. We are the number one party for farmers.” “We are making big gains in the civil service,” continues Lacapelle - Marine Le Pen's close friend. “In the police and army, and we are not doing badly among small business-owners. We represent a cross-section of France.” But unlike nationalist parties in some other countries, the FN does not do well among the over-65s. And if normalisation of the party is complete why does a shadow still persist over the FN's name? Do the words National Front and Le Pen have a perpetual power to alienate? Its critics strenuously argue the party's ethos is unchanged. For Laurent Joffrin, editor of left-wing daily Liberation, the FN still favours the insider and scapegoats the outsider. Today the implicit accusation they direct at Muslims is exactly the same as the one they used to direct at Jews.” “That these people are in some essential way different, and therefore dangerous to national unity,” he says. The persistent accusation is that in its modern, “normalised” form the party is not being entirely frank - that in private, members are far more bigoted than they ever let on openly, and that their public discourse is in some way coded. ""Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!""Graffiti next to FN posters in southern France, 2016(Getty Images) Veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, who has covered every presidential election since 1965, says the FN still has an indirect way of attacking Muslims. When Marine Le Pen champions the exclusion of religion from the public sphere it is “a smokescreen for anti-immigration” he says. It is Muslim veils, not Christian crosses, that she has in mind. Rejection of Muslims has wide support, especially among the working class, according to Cecile Cornudet of Les Echos newspaper. So she uses secularism, orlaïcité,and defence of women as a way of being anti-Islam. Demonstration against the FN in Tours, 2011(EPA) The FN's opponents point out that Marine still has on her staff former members of a far-right militant group called GUD. Many in the Muslim community do not trust her. Iman Mestaoui, a 25-year-old clothes designer of Moroccan parents, sees Marine Le Pen as merely a more presentable version of her father. “She's definitely a racist, but she hides it better. She hides the Islamophobia. She is totally scary,” she says. But this “just-scratch-beneath-the-surface” argument has its limits. If people insist over and again that they do not have a particular opinion, is it fair to judge them by saying that you think they do? In France they call that aprocès d'intention- putting people on trial for views you tell them that they have. People who resent the allegation that they are racist are voting FN to thumb their noses at the establishment. As for Marine herself, even her enemies - or most of them - stop short of saying she is personally racist. Montretout is a three-storey, mid-19th Century pile in a gated community on a hill above the Seine that overlooks Paris from the west.  It sits in its garden at the end of a private road next to several other houses of similar vintage. This is where the Le Pens lived from 1976, after Jean-Marie inherited the property from a cement magnate who was a political supporter. The Le Pen family mansion - MontretoutSt Cloud, near Paris It was a highly controversial gift - the late magnate's brother contested it - but in the end the house became an integral part of the Le Pen saga. “It is very symbolic. Aloof, on a hill, with this magnificent view over the capital - it is just like Jean-Marie himself, who was always looking on the system from outside,” says Olivier Beaumont, whose book on the Le Pens is called In the Hell of Montretout. It's quite scary-looking - a bit like the house in Psycho. Which fits too, because the Le Pens have always given the establishment the shivers.” Even today the house is part of the story. Marine carried on living at the Le Pen estate into her 40s, in a bungalow in the grounds. In the summer of 2014 she finally moved out. It was at the height of the row with her father. “The things I saw there you would not believe! She and her father were 100m apart but communicating via intermediaries. It was vaudeville,” says a former senior adviser to Marine, who asks not to be identified. Again, the final straw could not have been more symbolic. It came when one of Jean-Marie's dogs killed his daughter's adored cat, Artemis. For Marine, who sometimes says she wishes she could give it all up and open a cattery, it was all too much. Today Montretout is home on the second floor to Jean-Marie's second daughter Yann, mother of the rising young FN star Marion Marechal Le Pen. The eldest Le Pen daughter Marie-Caroline is, like Marine, estranged from her father and lives elsewhere.  In her case the split goes back to 2002 - they haven't talked since. Jean-Marie Le Penwith daughters Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine in themid-1990s(Getty Images) Jean-Marie no longer lives in the house but he comes every day to his office on the first floor.  Meanwhile, in the bungalow, there now resides his former wife Pierrette, mother of the three girls. The same Pierrette who left him in 1984 swearing he was the devil incarnate, and then posed nude in Playboy as an act of revenge. Indeed it was Pierrette's sudden disappearance when Marine was 16 that formed the second trauma in the FN leader's life. Her mother left without explanation, and Marine had no contact with her for the next 15 years. Pierrette and Jean-Marie Le Penshortly before their splitin 1984(Getty Images) In her autobiographyA contre flots(Against the Waves) Marine states: “For a month and a half I vomited every day. I was incapable of feeding myself… What I suffered was the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: my mother did not love me.” Marine Le Pen's inner toughness stems from this ultimate desertion, as much as the bombing. She learned to cope. Her father told her to “keep things in perspective. 'Remember,' he said: 'You could be naked in the snow in a war.'” It was hard living with the Le Pen name. In her book, Marine speaks of the teasing at school, and of the betrayal by teachers and even Catholic priests who made sure she knew how much they loathed her father. As she tried to make her way as a lawyer she was boycotted by many of her contemporaries who objected to her father's politics. She ended up doing business solely for the party. Marine Le Pen working as a lawyer, 1995(Getty Images) All of this created a sense of injustice. She could not see in her father the monster constantly vilified by politicians and press. So gradually she started taking up the political cudgels herself. “If you are called Le Pen, eventually politics will come and catch you,” says her niece Marion Marechal Le Pen. “With a name like that, there is nothing else you can do!” But there is another aspect of Marine Le Pen's upbringing in Montretout which bears on the politician she is today. Because far from being the pillars of bourgeois respectability that many suppose them to have been, the Le Pen parents lived back then in a state of chaos. There were parties and endless dinners for Jean-Marie's cronies. He and Pierrette were constantly travelling. More and more the girls were left to their own devices. Marine went to a local state school, and there she mixed with boys and girls born like her in that highly significant year - 1968. 1968 was the year that changed France. It was the student protests in Paris versus the intransigent President Charles de Gaulle. Politically, the regime held. But otherwise the country was transformed. For supporters it meant a more tolerant, diverse society. For opponents it was the start of the left wing's half century of cultural hegemony. Today Marine Le Pen is a nationalist. She is unabashedly opposed to immigration. But there is no hint in her of the far-right ideology that clung to members of her father's generation. According to Laurent Joffrin of Liberation,Marine's views are eclectic and opportunistic. “Nationalists are always like that - whatever is for the nation is right,” he says. Thus in her autobiography written in 2005 she argued against the 35-hour week, but now she supports it. FN ideas about fixing the retirement age at 60 are interchangeable with those of the far left. The influence of her generation is key. “I noticed working with her that when a question came up her first reflex was a reflex of the left,” says the former adviser to Marine, who does not want to be named. “She does not have right-wing reflexes. For me, right-wing people are people who value liberty over equality. And left-wing people are the opposite. Well, Marine always chose equality over liberty.” - EU renegotiation with Brussels followed by a referendum - 15,000 new police and 40,000 new prison places - 35-hour working week and retirement age fixed at 60 - Legal immigration cut to 10,000 per year - Automatic expulsion of undocumented immigrants - Priority for French nationals in social housing Most noticeably it is on social matters that Marine Le Pen is a million miles from the caricature of the far-right traditionalist. She refused to join the movement against gay marriage, which brought millions on to the streets in 2013, and she has several gay advisers, notably Florian Philippot. Then again, Jean-Marie's long-standing personal assistant is also a gay man. And if she is religious in a loose kind of way, she is scathing in her book about literalist interpreters of Catholicism. She is twice divorced and angrily defends women's right to abortion, although she regards it as a sad necessity. Contrast that with the opinions of that other denizen of Montretout - Marine's niece Marion. Marine Le Pen and Marion Marechal Le Pen in 2016(Getty Images) Marion Marechal Le Pen, one of the FN's two MPs, was born in 1990. One of her closest friends is Madeleine de Jessey, spokeswoman for the pro-Catholic family-values and anti-abortion movement Sens Commun. Though they love each other deeply - Marine was a second mother, says Marion - their politics are very different. According to Marion: “I am from the generation of the anti-May 1968. My generation is reacting against all the ideological deconstruction that happened after the student rebellion. We want principles, values, mentors - everything in fact that negates May '68. “For Marine the cultural victory of May '68 dominated her childhood and adolescence. But today things are switching over.” Marion has another big difference from her aunt. She still has a good relationship with Jean-Marie. In fact they dote on each other. Jean-Marie Le Pen will be 89 this year.  He moves more slowly than he used to, and he is a little hard of hearing.  But his voice booms as powerfully as ever, punctuated by seafaring metaphors and guffaws of laughter. “Young people on the right,” he says, “are so much more radical than their parents.” His first-floor study at Montretout is full of memorabilia from a lifetime of incident - Russian icons, a model ship, a portrait of a young Le Pen in officer's uniform and eye-patch, a massive set of binoculars trained on Paris to the east. Jean-Marie Le Pen in his study at Montretout The sea is a constant motif in Le Pen's life - one little-known fact is that he introduced the duffle coat to France. He bought it in a navy surplus store in Plymouth for £2 after a trans-Channel yacht race in the early 1950s. No-one in Paris had seen one before. He's willing to talk at length about his daughter Marine. Despite their falling out, was he nonetheless happy at her success? “But think how much better she would be doing if she had not excluded me from the party!  Right now she is on 27%. With me involved she would be on 35%,” he says. She is reaping today the benefits of all the work I carried out over 40 years of great hardship.” “Maybe by getting rid of me she wanted to make some kind of gesture to the establishment. “But I still represent something in this land. And if she brought me back into the fold, I would bring with me all the radical formations of the right and far right who are now outside her compass.” For Jean-Marie, a single person represents all that has gone wrong with the party -  Marine's close adviser Florian Philippot. Marine Le Pen with Florian Philippot(Getty Images) Philippot is - after Marine - the FN's most prominent public figure. He is anénarque.In other words he went to the ENA, the administration school that churns out members of the French establishment and, most importantly, he is a man of the nationalist left. Largely under his influence, the FN has shifted its economic policies to overt protection of the working class. Jean-Marie says: “For him to have such preponderant influence, for him to monopolise the message… that is wrong.” But Jean-Marie seems happier talking about the past. He is a rebel by nature. In his own eye he is someone who exposes establishment hypocrisy. The roots of his tempestuous career are at the end of World War Two, when Jean-Marie felt that the national story, dominated by the movement of liberation hero Charles de Gaulle, and by the Communists, was a sham. Later he fought in France's last imperial wars - Indochina, Suez, Algeria - and became its youngest member of parliament behind the shopkeeper-turned-populist leader Pierre Poujade. Jean-Marie, even now an MEP, voted against the Treaty of Rome setting up the EU in 1957. The EU - for Le Pen - was one of the great betrayals. Algeria was the other. After a brutal civil war in Algeria, De Gaulle was instrumental in accepting that France would have to give up its colony. After independence, the vast majority of the European settlers - the pieds noirs - ended up in France. Le Pen tells a story to show that he has no bigotry - how he insisted on proper burial rites for dead Egyptian soldiers during the Suez campaign in 1956. But what about the question ofle détail? “Ok. Thedétail.Thedétailwas in 1987. Then it came back in 2015. That's not exactly every day! “To my knowledge no-one has provided proof to contradict what I said.” I said the gas chambers are a detail of the history of the war. That seems to me indisputable.” But wasn't he hinting that the gas chambers were insignificant? He avoids the question. “My dear sir, if we are to judge people on the basis of what wesaythat they think - that is one of the definitions of tyranny.” And how does he feel about rifts with two daughters? “Mon cher monsieur,” he leans forward. “It is life! Life is not a smooth tranquil stream. It has cataracts, it has obstacles.” “I am accustomed to adversity. For 60 years I have rowed against the current. Never once have we had the wind at our backs! Always we have had to sail into the gale - always the spray in our faces! No indeed, one thing we never got used to was the easy life!” At this point he is laughing his head off. Marine Le Pen has not had an easy time of it either. Her title for the autobiography - Against the Waves-nods to the favourite Le Pen image of the battling sailor. Jean-Marie's father was a Breton fisherman who drowned after his boat hit a German mine. The difference is that while Jean-Marie seemed to care little about failure - relishing the thrill of the struggle - Marine has made success her watchword. The electoral system has always been an obstacle for the FN.  Only once - between 1986 and 1988 when there was a brief period of proportional representation - have they had more than one or two deputies in the National Assembly. But with Marine at the helm things are changing. National Front share of vote in French elections In addition to the two MPs, the party has 20 MEPs in Strasbourg and many hundreds of local councillors. FN or FN-affiliated mayors control 11 towns. FN bastions are concentrated in two areas - the far north and the far south. And two different political traditions are now feeding into party's electorate.

In Henin-Beaumont, a few miles south of Lille, Marine's friend Steeve Briois has been mayor since 2014. This is an ultra-depressed former mining town, whose last industries - Samsonite cases and metal production - have long since relocated abroad. The town centre is dominated by a vast modern church, currently under renovation. The only eateries are Middle Eastern grills. The beggars are locals. Like all of this region, Henin-Beaumont has always voted left. Until recently the Socialists took 60% of the vote and the Communists another 20%. In his office Briois sits beneath a bust of the early 20th Century Socialist hero Jean Jaures. The statement is clear - that in FN eyes the left has betrayed its origins and its people. The argument is often made that the FN today is taking over where the old French Communist Party (PC) left off. Back in the 1950s the PC too could claim to be the country's largest party. But it never rose above 25% in the polls, and in the end withered into irrelevance. Derelict industrial buildingHenin-Beaumont, northern France Jean-Marie Le Pen once said that “communists are good patriots who just don't know it”, and it is obvious in Henin-Beaumont that the same working-class people who once voted far left now feel the FN is their natural home. The FN's language of values, education, protection for industry and hatred of global finance all goes down very well indeed. “I am no fan of communism - but in the 1950s the PC was intensely patriotic,” says Briois. “Look at their posters from back then. It was all: Produce in France. Keep it French. That I can identify with.” Steeve Briois in Henin-Beaumont(Getty Images) The soft-spoken Briois is popular in the town. “For years we had elites in the town hall. People decked out with diplomas and all sorts of expertise. And the place was a disaster,” he says. “Then along I come with virtually no qualifications. And we are doing the job OK. It goes to show that the people may not be as stupid as you think.” In the main square, Dominique Vignon, a 53-year-old social worker, is among several people who back him up. “My first vote was for Mitterrand in 1981, and I have voted on the left in every election since. But the left has betrayed us. The Socialists are right-wing. “I concede that the FN label shocks some people. But since Briois came to power the only things that have changed are that the taxes have come down and the place is better run. There is no discrimination. The North Africans are still on their market stalls.” Almost directly due south and 600 miles away, the historic town of Beziers is another FN stronghold. Or to be more accurate, FN-affiliated. The town's mayor Robert Menard came to power with the support of the party but he is not a member. Menard is a controversial character. Originally on the far-left of French politics, he chose to run his home town of Beziers for the nationalist right because he says “the world has changed… I could not look at the reality and pretend it was otherwise”. Robert Menard, mayor of Beziers(EPA) Menard has a terrible press in France. Some of his posters are deliberately provocative, and he once drew up an ethnic list of the town's schools, revealing that two-thirds of children were Muslim. His attempt to set up a volunteer civilian militia to patrol the town's streets was struck down by the courts. But he is popular in Beziers, a town built on wine wealth from the late 19th Century. On a walkabout on the famous promenade he is buttonholed by well-wisher after well-wisher, among them an Algerian boutique owner. Robert Menard talks to voters in Beziers
, southern France(EPA) Chrystele Crouton and Florence Boucard, a couple from Paris and Brittany who run theHôtel Particuliernear the town centre, are lavish in their praise. And they are far from being natural FN voters. “It is remarkable what he has done. In a few months the place has been transformed. On the promenade, it was disgusting. There were drug-dealers and drunks. But now people are coming back. It's alive again.” Property taxes were lowered. Old buildings were restored. Bus stop in Beziers, southern France(EPA) Beziers has been transformed by immigration, with many town-centre houses now divided into flats and inhabited by people of Maghrebi (North African) origin. On the outskirts is an estate called La Deveze, which has a reputation for drugs, arms-trafficking and radical Islam. Menard, who is apied-noir- someone of European descent born in French Algeria - lived in La Deveze as a boy. “Back then La Deveze meant social progress. There were Arabs there, pieds-noirs,and metropolitan French. And we all got along. The first thing the Algerian mothers did when they arrived in France was take off their headscarves. The fathers would smack the kids if they heard them talking Arabic on the street,” he says. Now he says you couldn't force him to live there. Stairwell by stairwell, he says, North Africans, Turks and French Roma (gypsies) live in separation. For Menard, the French social model has broken down. He thinks immigration has to stop completely so that the country can do what it can to integrate those that are here. The state school system - in which large numbers of children speak more Arabic than French - needs urgent attention. Anti-migrant poster in Beziers, southern France(Getty Images) And he denies that he only gets “white” votes. “Do you think I would be mayor if Maghrebis did not vote for me? Do you know why they vote for me? One, I am anti-gay marriage, and so are they. And two, I am authoritarian, and they would like to be too.” Both Menard in Beziers and Briois in Henin-Beaumont reject the argument that there are two National Fronts. One ex-communist in the north, left-wing in inspiration. The other ex-pied noir in the south, right-wing and more focused on national identity. The emphasis may be different, but at heart they see no difference at all. Friends of Marine Le Pen say that one of her familiar gestures is what you might call the fruit-machine pull. A downward tug of the right arm, fist clenched, in imitation of a person playing a one-armed bandit. In English it might be accompanied by the word “kerching!”. She has been making the gesture a lot recently. Because the kerchings keep on coming. “At exactly the moment Marine completed her de-demonisation process, events started happening on the world stage that push voters in her direction,” says columnist Cecile Cornudet. Brexit and Donald Trump's victory are two pieces of news that FN strategists could have dreamed of only in their wildest imaginings. “The UK is our best advertisement,” says Marine's friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “As for Trump... if it is OK for an American president to push for protection and immigration controls, then it is OK in France as well.” Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage with Donald Trump in August 2016,Mississippi, USA(AP) But one question keeps coming back. How far-right is the National Front? In an FN-run France, walls go up. Foreigners and foreign goods are kept out. Brussels is pushed to the margin. The franc returns, and France comes first. According to veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, it is “a former party of the far right that has become a populist party with instincts that are xenophobic and authoritarian”. For the party's Steeve Briois, “far-right is not a term we accept. It makes an automatic link with Hitler, which is why our enemies use it. We prefer patriotic, protectionist, national. Not national-ist. That sounds aggressive. And populist we like too.” In its economic plan the FN has swung far to the left, with anti-austerity and protectionist policies that are a clear signal to the working class. That leftward shift prompted the resignation of the former adviser to Marine Le Pen, who says the FN is “nationalist, populist and socialist. Not national-socialist - that has certain historical connotations. But social-nationalist.” What everyone would agree on is that the FN has built its programme around the idea of the nation - “national” identity and values. Marine Le Pen casting her votein France's 2015 regional elections(EPA) Marine Le Pen says she is “not against immigrants, but against immigration” - because any nation needs first to look after the people who are its citizens. But for the FN's enemies, the nation-first answer is wrong, dangerous and a betrayal of France's mission to the world. “It is about universal values,” says Liberation's Joffrin. “Do they exist or not?  I understand that when times are bad people want to return to their roots. That is why this national ideology is returning.” But our duty is to go above that - to think of the values that matter for all human beings. The trouble is that these days, that is a very hard sell.” In the West - it seems - the nation is returning, a political idea on which the National Front has had a monopoly in France for more than a generation. For journalist Elisabeth Levy, a leading light in the “new right” philosophical movement, “it is not that France has become Le Penist, reality has become Le Penist”. “In every country we are confronted with the same question - how do you integrate millions of immigrants? And the answer is you can't - not if they keep on coming.” In other countries populist, nationalist parties have grown up, without triggering the same gasps of horror. Part of the reason for the alarm is that the FN has always had a terrible press. In France it has suited successive governments, especially on the left, to caricature the party in the worst possible light. But there is a difference in France - and that is history. The roots of the FN lie in the country's troubled past - a past in which ideology and violence have often advanced hand in hand. Outbursts of civil unrest remain a part of the French psyche. The 1871 Paris Commune was followed by the anti-Semitic Dreyfus affair in 1894. The wartime Vichy regime was followed by the fighting in Algeria. In France people take sides. They believe in ideas. And if the conditions are right they will fight for them. That is why it all feels more real here. A Marine Le Pen presidency could well spark violence on a scale far greater than the protests she currently attracts. The FN has no experience when it comes to taking on the task of government. And Marine has no allies, which makes election success all the harder. Thecordon sanitaireremains in place. But her father knows a thing or two. Watch forles évènements,  he says.Things happen.

"If it was designed to grab headlines it certainly did that. Nicola Sturgeon slammed the ball into Theresa May's court on the question of another independence referendum. There were accusations on both sides yesterday. The first minister accused the prime minister of ""intransigence"", of being a ""brick wall"". The PM accused the Scottish government of ""playing politics"" (yes that old chestnut) and Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said Ms Sturgeon was ""obsessed"". The first minister has turned up the attacks today, questioning the prime minister'smandate for governing, in this tweet.,external Forget about the political verbiage between the two for a second though. What might Theresa May's options actually be? Is there actually going to be a second independence referendum vote, when it is the last thing that Number 10 wants to happen? 1. She could say 'No' immediately:This is extremely unlikely. Both sides know this would likely give the SNP a big bump in the polls and wouldn't remotely take the issue off the table. 2.Say 'Yes' immediately:This is also extremely unlikely. Number 10 doesn't want this vote to take place and backing down now is almost unthinkable for a prime minister whose first visit was to Scotland, making it clear preserving the union is near the top of her list 3.Say 'Not now, but not never':This is basically the position the government has taken so far, as David Mundell suggested yesterday. Westminster does not want to make it easy for the Scottish government. And what they won't agree to is the SNP's timetable of holding a vote before the Brexit negotiations are done. 4.Play it long:This seems to be the second part of the strategy. Don't allow Nicola Sturgeon to set the terms of the narrative. She did yesterday, but with Theresa May holding off from triggering Article 50, the next fortnight could leave Nicola Sturgeon twisting in the wind, looking as if she moved too fast. While trying to avoid accepting a referendum, the Tories will try to keep the arguments focused on why they believe a vote should not take place. The SNP, however, may equally try to make this look as if Westminster is ignoring their demands, which of course, strengthens their case still further. 5.Do a deal behind closed doors:This isn't the official position and no one on either side would acknowledge such a thing. But there are whispers that this has already happened. The theory goes that the UK government has accepted the inevitable and will allow the referendum to go ahead, but only on the basis that the agreement to do so includes a ""sunrise clause"" - so Nicola Sturgeon wins the right to hold the vote but in law, can't do so until the UK has left the EU. There's even a suggestion Westminster may stipulate that the second vote can't take place until after the next Holyrood election. That would be fiercely resisted by the SNP who could argue their victory in 2016 gave them a clear mandate for a second vote. 6.Call Ms Sturgeon's bluff:Theresa May could suddenly suggest that despite the frustrations of their talks so far, that there could be a different deal for Scotland, and she will appeal to the EU Commission on Scotland's behalf to pursue that path. If Number 10 explored this publicly, it would be much harder for the Scottish Government to make its case. One SNP insider said it would ""shoot our fox"". But a UK government source downplayed the possibility of doing so. It would be a significant change in the UK approach and could open the door to complicated concessions and demands on many different fronts. Let's be clear, Theresa May really doesn't want to have a referendum. Senior SNP figures insist that Nicola Sturgeon, as she said yesterday, is completely serious about still being open to compromises if they can be made. But with the political temperature already at boiling point, it's hard to see how they can find a solution that works for both sides.

"Associating someone with Nazis - as in this Turkish TV broadcast - is unlikely to win any logical arguments Labelling an opponent as ""worse than Hitler"" or saying a policy is ""like Nazi Germany"" is hardly new. But recently, it has crept into political discussion on an international scale. As a row between Turkey and the EU deepened in early 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both the Germans and the Dutch of using Nazi tactics. Similar comparisons plagued the 2016 US presidential election, and they can be found in every medium, from Twitter to national parliaments. So why is it so widespread? The answer, according to America's Anti-Defamation League (ADL), is simply that it is the ""most available historical event illustrating right versus wrong."" When an argument descends to such fundamentals, the comparison inevitably turns up. But ""misplaced comparisons trivialise this unique tragedy in human history,"" the ADL's national director Jonathan Greenblatt says, ""particularly when public figures invoke the Holocaust in an effort to score political points."" A German float in the Rose Monday parade declaring ""blonde is the new brown"" referenced the brownshirts - Nazi paramilitaries Mr Greenblatt made those comments during the US presidential election, at a time when Donald Trump's policy announcements had led to comparisons to Adolf Hitler. Yet Trump has done the exact same thing himself -comparing the US intelligence agencies,externalto ""Nazi Germany"". The UK's Boris Johnsoncompared the EU to the Nazis during the Brexit campaign; a UN investigator used the comparisonfor Israeli actions in Gaza,external; Russian television hasapplied the label to the West over the Aleppo crisis. Johan Franklin's election message went viral - though he admits it's a ""pretty crude"" comparison In fact, comparing someone to Hitler to invalidate their point is so popular it's been given its own fake Latin name, thereductio ad Hitlerum- a play on the very real logic termreductio ad absurdum.It's mostly used to point out the fallacy of comparing almost anyone to Hitler. Even the German man who posteda viral image comparing Mr Trump to Hitlerduring the election acknowledged the comparison was ""pretty crude"". Of course, nowhere are Nazi slurs more numerous than on the internet - and it's always been that way. In 1990, an American lawyer named Mike Godwin noticed that arguments on early internet forums would constantly resort to calling the other side a Nazi. And so Godwin's Law - that if an online discussion goes on long enough sooner or later someone will make a comparison to Hitler - was born, and became a ""rule of the internet"". But Godwin originally coined the phrase to point out how ridiculous the comparison always is. ""I wanted to hint that most people who brought Nazis into a debate... weren't being thoughtful and independent. Instead, they were acting just as predictably, and unconsciously, as a log rolling down a hill,""he wrote in an opinion column for the Washington Post,external. In some parts of the internet, the appearance of Godwin's law was seen as a sign the discussion is over. But the recent spate of high-profile spats proves that it hasn't reduced spurious Hitler references in real life. When Turkey's President Erdogan levelledaccusations of Nazi practices against Germany, it made international headlines. But for Germans, it's treading old ground in a country which has strong laws against Holocaust denial or glorifying Nazi activity. ""I don't think that most Germans are too fazed about this type of comparison,"" said Professor Christoph Mick, a historian from the University of Warwick. ""They are used to it, and find it just bizarre that the most democratic and most liberal state in German history is compared to the Third Reich. These comparisons say more about those making [them] than about today's Germany and its politicians."" This video can not be played President Erdogan makes Nazi Germany taunt So - if a Nazi reference trivialises the Holocaust, is widely acknowledged as a logical fallacy, is ridiculed online, and ignored by the Germans - it must have some persuasive power to have stayed around so long - right? Not so, according to the English Speaking Union, an educational charity that promotes clear communication and critical thinking. ""Wielding accusations of fascism as an insult doesn't help to get your audience on side - instead, you raise the stakes of the debate, forcing a polarisation between 'good' and 'evil' into a discussion that may have reasonable positions on both sides,"" says Amanda Moorghen, the group's senior research and resources officer. ""Most of the time, people call others 'Nazis' because they think it will grab the attention of the audience. ""This is a big mistake, because any attention they do get will be drawn to the use of that word, rather than to the nitty gritty of the topic at hand."" And the secret to real success? ""It's far better to save strong words for the argument itself, rather than attacking the people you're arguing with,"" Amanda Moorghen says.

"This video can not be played PC Kelly Ellis says her friends have dubbed her Lara Croft PC Kelly Ellis has her finger hovering over the trigger of her Heckler and Koch G36 rifle. She has a split second to decide whether to open fire on a man who appears to be drunk and suicidal and is holding a shotgun, pointing it at the ground. Her colleague is calmly - but firmly - explaining the right thing to do is to put the weapon down. But what if he does not? What if he raises the barrels? What then? Welcome to the firearms training school. Over three months, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme had unique access to some of the new recruits being assessed in Cheshire. These are the scenarios - the life and death decisions - that any British officer who wants to carry a gun must go through. Aiming to qualify: PC Kelly Ellis And if they make the wrong decision - pull the trigger when there was no need, or pull it when it is too late - then they are out. They will not make the grade. By the end of next year, the UK will have about 7,500 armed police officers, after the government reversed a fall in their numbers since 2010. Officers with years of firearms experience had been leaving their forces as police budgets were cut. Now the numbers are rising again because security chiefs want more firearms teams available to counter any attempted Paris-style attack on the streets of Britain. But given that the job requires volunteers - and those volunteers may one day be accountable for their actions before a jury - have the new recruits got what it takes? While her friends have dubbed her ""Lara Croft"" - after the Tomb Raider action hero - PC Ellis says her parents were ""apprehensive"" when she first told them she wanted to train as a police firearms officer. However, she says: ""I tried to explain to them that the training we get, the weapons we are carrying, that actually I'm going to be more protected than I am now as a regular officer out on the streets."" She says the course is ""easily the hardest thing I've ever had to do"". ""It's just a lot to take in and a lot to remember. It's exhausting really."" PC Kelly Ellis in training Watch Dominic Casciani's full filmon firearms training on the Victoria Derbyshire website. And she says the possibility of coming face to face with an armed situation is now becoming more of a reality. ""Sometimes I go home from here of an evening, and you see what's going on in the news and you just think, 'In a few months' time, if I pass this course, that could be me, going out to that job, first on the scene, having to discharge a weapon.'"" She adds: ""It is about putting your life on the line, but that's what I want to do. ""I get a massive sense of achievement from doing it, as well."" Safety: Officers are first taught how to handle a weapon... The firearms centre in Cheshire trains officers from all over the country. We watched 15 recruits being taught how to: shoot search and clear buildings of suspects stop a vehicle carrying an armed suspect save the lives of anyone critically injured in an incident. And that includes saving the lives of people they have just shot: according to the programme, they are trained to incapacitate a threat - not to kill. ... and also how to save lives Did they pass? Well, watch our fly-on-the-wall film to find out. Without giving too much away, what I and my colleagues John Owen, producer, and Martin McQuade, camera, witnessed was an awful lot of hard work. There were some moments where recruits got a dressing down by their trainers for failing to learn fast enough. The point was repeatedly made to them that if they were slow in making the right decision, the consequences could be fatal. And they also needed to learn when to use words, rather than bullets, to stop a situation spiralling out of control. Officers practise how to contain vehicles carrying armed suspects Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the recently retired Metropolitan Police Commissioner, warned that his force was recruiting from a very shallow pool of officers willing to carry a gun. That, he says, is because many don't want the risks that come with the job - not necessarily the risk of being shot, but of ending up in court or under investigation for years. Despite the political and media focus being on terrorism, the reality is that most of armed response policing work is unchanged from year to year. Sometimes they'll be called to an armed robbery - less often than they used to be. But most of the time they'll be dealing with extreme domestic violence situations, organised gang crime incidents and, sadly, mentally unwell people capable of doing themselves, or others harm. So were the trainee officers I saw up to the task? Watch the film and decide for yourself.

"Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out: ""It's my one shot"" The actor at the centre of a debate about the casting of British black actors in the US has spoken about how being black has lost him roles. Daniel Kaluuya, who was born in London, leads the cast of Get Out - a searing racial satire about contemporary America. Released in the UK this week, Jordan Peele's horror film has already been a massive hit at the US box office, making more than $100m (Â£82.5m). But the film hit the headlines last week after actor Samuel L Jacksoncriticised Hollywood for casting black British actorsin films about US race relations. Girls star Allison Williams plays Rose Speaking to the BBC, Skins star Kaluuya said he was proud to be in the first lead role of his career. ""You do stuff, people make decisions and it goes out there and people have opinions. And everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" he said. ""I love all my black brothers and sisters worldwide, and that's my position. ""All I know is this my first ever lead role in a film and I've lost out on a lot of roles because I'm black."" He added: ""It's my one shot. I'm going to come through it and do my thing and go home."" He went on to describe Jackson as a ""legend on and off screen"". Director Jordan Peele is the first African-American to earn $100m with his debut feature In his original radio interview a week ago, Jackson said he wondered what Get Out would have been like with a US actor in the lead role. ""Daniel grew up in a country where they've been interracial dating for 100 years,"" he said. Clarifying his remarks later in the week,he said his criticism was not of other actors, but of the Hollywood system. Other actors have joined the debate, with Star Wars actor John Boyegatweeting,externalthat it was a ""conflict we don't have time for"". In anarticle for The Guardian,external, Homeland actor David Harewood argued that Britons may be better suited to some parts because they are not burdened by ""what's in the history books"". In Get Out, Kaluuya plays Chris, an African-American photographer who goes with his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to visit her parents at their country home. Chris is worried because Rose has not told her family she has a black boyfriend. Meet the parents: Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford (on the left) with Allison Williams, Betty Gabriel and Daniel Kaluuya He initially receives a warm welcome - if a bit odd at times - but as the weekend progresses, Chris discovers Rose's parents have a very different agenda. ""Jordan wrote this as a response to the idea that racism was 'solved' because Obama was president,"" Kaluuya said. Peele has admitted he had not wanted to cast a British actor, but that Kaluuya had won him over during an initial audition. ""We spoke on Skype,"" Kaluuya confirmed. ""He was very wary because it's an African-American specific experience, but then we had a chat about what it's like being black worldwide and being black in London."" The film's success has made Peele the first African-American writer-director to earn $100m with his debut movie,according to The Wrap,external. How much did Kaluuya identify with the film's themes? ""There are an uncountable amount of instances when I've been paranoid,"" he said. ""I did a shoot in Lithuania when I was 17. Everywhere I went people were pointing and staring. ""Or when I go to Lidl and I get followed by security guards.  Is that because it's me, I'm black or what I'm wearing? ""It's every day, navigating your life, getting stopped by police, I've had it all."" Kaluuya is currently filming Ryan Coogler's superhero film Black Panther in Atlanta, US. ""It's a life-changing experience for me,"" he said.  ""I can't wait to finish filming so I can watch it."" Get Out is out in the UK on 17 March.

"This video can not be played Who is the minister leading the UK's Brexit negotiations? Nicholas Watt reports Until well into the 1980s, Tory grandees tended to show interest in new MPs only if they had aristocratic heritage or were a waspish intellect in the mould of Chris Patten. The odd exception was made. Sir John Major was eventually admitted into the Blue Chip group of Tory MPs first elected in 1979, though only when it became clear he was racing to the top. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who was elected to Parliament a generation ago, in 1987, is neither an aristocrat nor a whimsical intellectual. He had a troubled upbringing and is more of an intellectual bruiser dating back to the time when he stood up to his bullying stepfather. But Mr Davis marked himself out to Tory grandees after accepting a dare. Over dinner hosted by the late Alan Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the ""black"" route, the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel. David Davis' physical courage impressed his Conservative colleagues ""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary. Mr Davis' training in the SAS (Reserve) regiment - which helped fund his way through university - had paid off. Nonchalantly completing the black route cemented Mr Davis' reputation among Tories as a fearless hard man. But it also illustrated another character trait that gives an insight into his approach to the Brexit negotiations. Mr Davis is prepared to take risks but never in a reckless way, and only after a careful calculation of all the options in front of him. Mr Davis' belief in taking calculated risks explains one of the central decisions Theresa May has taken in her approach to Brexit. This was her declaration,outlined in her Lancaster House speech in January on the Brexit negotiations, the UK was prepared to walk away from a bad deal. Mr Davis had advised the prime minister the EU would take the UK seriously only if it showed it was unafraid of no deal. Former foe Michael Howard backs David Davis' strong stance towards Brexit negotiations Lord Howard of Lympne, the former Tory leader, who had difficult relations with David Davis in his days as shadow home secretary, wholeheartedly endorses his approach. ""Obviously it would be better place for the EU and the UK if a sensible constructive deal is struck,"" Lord Howard told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""But if, for whatever reason, they don't want to do that, we'll be fine without a deal. ""We can manage without a deal - better with one, fine without one."" The confidence that led Mr Davis to advise the prime minister to think nothing of calling the bluff of the remaining EU member states has won him an admiring band of supporters on the Tory benches. But, to some, his confidence can border on cockiness. One Tory grandee told Newsnight: ""He is the only man I know who can swagger sitting down."" Mr Davis later admitted the use of T-shirts emblazoned with his 2005 leadership campaign slogan, ""It's DD for me,"" had backfired Andrew Mitchell, the former cabinet minister who ran Mr Davis' unsuccessful campaign for the Tory leadership in 2005, told Newsnight: ""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person. ""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education."" Mr Mitchell became firm friends with Mr Davis when they both worked in the bruising battleground of the Tory whips' office in the 1990s, pushing through the Maastricht treaty. There is something of an irony that the man who enforced the integrationist treaty - which pushed many Tories into outright opposition to Brussels - is now leading the UK out of the EU. Lord Howard, believed to be one of three Eurosceptic cabinet ministers at the time of the Maastricht battle dubbed ""bastards"" by Sir John Major, sees no contradiction. ""I suppose you could say we've all been on a journey,"" he told Newsnight. ""Maastricht was a long time ago. The EU has become much more integrationist since then, and the flaws in the project more apparent."" David Davis did not get on with David Cameron Mr Davis had a mixed career after the Tories lost power in 1997. He loved hounding civil servants as chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee between 1997 and 2001. He put down a marker when he emerged as the dark horse candidate in the 2001 Tory leadership contest, making him the favourite in 2005 until he was upstaged by David Cameron during the party conference. The boy from the south London council estate and the Etonian never hit it off. Mr Cameron regarded Mr Davis as vain and self-aggrandising when he triggered a by-election over civil liberties, which he won, in 2008. This paved the way for nearly a decade on the backbenches as a serial rebel, where he repeatedly clashed with Mrs May over civil liberties. Then, last summer, in his late 60s, he was finally asked to join the cabinet, by Mrs May, as one of three Brexiteers. And Mr Davis, unlike Liam Fox and Boris Johnson, who are seen as sources of trouble, has won the trust of the prime minister. Mr Davis (l) has won the trust of Mrs May No 10 sources say Mr Davis has come into his own on Brexit, and is even turning into something of an elder statesman. Just down the street, in his office at No 9, Mr Davis puts his success down to two factors: silence and what he calls proximity. He has avoided talking out of line and has made a point of squatting in the building next to No 10 to ensure he can easily wander up the street if problems arise. Mr Davis, who will celebrate his 70th birthday a few months before the Article 50 negotiations are due to end, in March 2019, says he has one shot at making a success of Brexit, which he is determined to achieve. He hopes to retire a happy man at that point, although he appears not to have ruled out another challenge. Mr Mitchell told Newsnight: ""I don't know if this is last hurrah or not.

"The claim:The ruling by the EU's top court could exclude many Muslim women from the workplace. Reality Check verdict:The EU court ruling does allow private companies to adopt rules that bar workers from wearing religious symbols under certain conditions but is not a blanket ban on Islamic headscarves. On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, ruled that a Belgium firm was within its rights to dismiss an employee who began wearing an Islamic headscarf to work on the grounds that the head covering was against company rules on appearance in a public-facing role. The court ruled in favour of the company because it had an ""image neutrality"" policy prohibiting the wearing of any religious clothing or symbols. Furthermore, the policy was, in the court's view, ""genuinely pursued in a consistent and systematic manner"". Tuesday's ruling included a judgement on another related case which concerned a woman in France who refused to take off her headscarf at a private company, after a client objected to her wearing it. In this instance, the court ruled that she had been discriminated against as the company had no ""image neutrality"" policy and only dismissed her following the client's complaint. EU laws prohibit companies, private or public, discriminating on the grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. Indirect discrimination, where rules set by a company may disadvantage a certain group, is also prohibited, unless there is a specific justification such as a company wishing to project a ""neutral"" image. In the Belgian case, theECJ ruling,externalsays that because the company's work appearance rules were written and shared among employees the action was justified. Ultimately, the final judgement on the ECJ ruling will rest with the courts in France and Belgium. The Open Society Justice Initiative, a group backed by financier George Soros, which supported the two women at the centre of this case, said the ruling ""weakens the guarantee of equality that is at the heart of the EU's anti-discrimination directive"" and will ""exclude many Muslim women from the workplace"". Prof Takis Tridimas from King's College, London, an expert in European law, said the ruling might allow employers to prevent some people wearing religious clothing at work in certain roles. However, the ruling is ""not specific to any particular religion"". Wearing an Islamic headscarf, as well as all other religious symbols, is already prohibited in France in public service jobs, even when employees are not in direct contact with the public. In Belgium, there are no federal rules on religious symbols at work, but the regional parliaments have taken measure to prohibit religious, political or philosophical symbols for public service workers who deal with the public. Other EU countries, such as the UK, do not have such rules. A number of EU countries have alsotaken measures to ban the full Islamic veil, which covers the face, in all public spaces.

"On 12 December 2015 a man's body was found lying on the ground on Saddleworth Moor. He had died from poisoning. He became known as theBody on the Moor. And the struggle to identify him became one of the strangest mysteries. No mobile, no identification of any kind. No family or friends came forward. One of the few people with any insight into the puzzle behind the man's death was Maureen Toogood. Maureen had a relationship with a man starting in the late 1960s. They didn't marry and she ended up marrying someone else but they stayed friends. For 40 years they saw each other regularly - she helped him in his garden and around the house. Then in 2006 he simply vanished from Maureen's life - upped sticks and left the country. All of the interviews here are taken from thenew episodeof the World at One's  Body on the Moorpodcast seriesby Jon Manel. Maureen believed he had sold his home and emigrated to California. The first she heard was when she received a call from his neighbour. She was told he was going to the US the following day. ""I was very hurt by this,"" she says. She was unable to contact him because his phone had been disconnected.  Since then, she says, she has thought about him often. Eleven years later she got another phone call. This time from the police. They had finally identified the body on the moor. They were calling because it was David Lytton, her friend. They knew little of his life and Maureen was able to fill in some of the gaps. Before he left in 2006, David had lived an apparently unremarkable life in south-west London, working as a croupier, a taxi controller for a mini-cab company, a baker and a train driver for the London Underground. Maureen says she met David in 1968. She was suffering from flu at the time but had ventured out to Finchley in north London to buy a stereo. It was the Last Night of the Proms and she wanted to enjoy listening to it at home. ""I didn't feel very well. I was on my knees, and I was collapsing. There was a young man who went 'Oh, hang on, hang on I'll come over,'"" she remembers. ""He walked home to my flat and he made me a nice cup of tea. We hit it off. He made me some toast - I hadn't had any breakfast and he stayed with me until my flatmates came home."" The following day, she says, he was back on her doorstep. ""'Hello, do you remember me?' he said. And he kept coming round every day. He didn't leave me at all. We would even meet in the launderette round the corner and do our washing together."" She describes him as a gentleman who liked to take care of her. He treated her to haircuts in fashionable Mayfair, where he was working as a croupier. But, although he was happy to treat his girlfriend, there were few extravagances for himself. His house in Streatham was sparsely decorated. There was no bed, just a piece of foam and a three-piece suite from a second-hand shop. Two items do stand out, though. Korans, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, she says. There was nothing in the kitchen - no fridge, no kettle, no food. ""He said he wasn't entitled to comforts. Where he got that I don't know,"" she says. The police went on to discover that David ate all his meals at the same local vegetarian restaurant at the same time each night. He dressed smartly and was very particular and precise. Maureen says she could have predicted the clothes that he would be wearing the morning he was found: ""M&S socks, white Jockey underwear, white vest, a singlet, cord trousers - navy blue, and round-neck sweater and an old mac that he probably had 30 or 40 years."" His luxury was a pair of shoes made by the Swiss designer Bally. David grew up in the north London suburb of Finchley. He was born David Keith Lautenberg on 21 April, 1948 to Sylvia and Hyman Lautenberg. He was Jewish, his family having originally come to Britain fleeing from Europe. At some time, his immediate family changed their name from Lautenberg. He changed his name to David Lytton in 1986. Timeline -David Lytton's final journey - from Lahore to Saddleworth Moor Thursday 10 December 2015 10:30 - Boards a Pakistan International Airways plane in Lahore and travels to London. He sits in economy seat 25C. 15:30 - Lands at Heathrow - he is met by a friend of 35 years and they have dinner together at the airport. Evening - Checks into the Travelodge in Ealing Broadway and books a room for five days. Friday 11 December 2015 09:04 - He pays Â£4.80 cash for a single ticket at Ealing Broadway and gets on the tube. 09:50 - At Euston station pays Â£81.60 cash for an off-peak return ticket to Manchester. 10:00 - Train departs, on its journey it stops at Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Stockport. 12:07 - Arrives on platform 6 at Manchester Piccadilly. At the station he visits a gambling arcade, Boots, WH Smith and buys an M&S sandwich. 13:00 - Leaves Manchester Piccadilly station on foot towards the city centre. There are a ""missing 59 minutes"" in the timeline - the police do not know how he got from the station to a pub 12 miles away. 14.00 - Walks into The Clarence Pub in the village of Greenfield, close to Saddleworth Moor - he asks the locals for ""directions to the top of the mountain"". 16.00 - As the sun sets across the moor, he passes two RSPB members walking down from the mountain. Saturday 12 December 2015 10:47 - David's body is discovered by a cyclist high up on the moor. The cyclist calls the police. Incident Log 936 reads ""male deceased found in local beauty spot"". Maureen and David met not long after he left Leeds University. He had gone to study psychology and sociology but, according to the police, he suffered from hypothyroidism and found it difficult to sleep at night. Instead, he slept during the day and didn't get the grades he wanted. When he returned to London he fell out with his family and moved out of his home. Maureen describes David as a ""strange"" man with some ""quirky ways"". ""But I did like him,"" she says. ""He was very particular, very precise and a gentleman. He was a lovely, lovely man."" He didn't have any hobbies or particular interests that she knew of. But the police have discovered that David had an interest in different religions, including Buddhism and Islam. His last job was as a driver for the London Underground, one which he was well-suited to, says Maureen. ""He enjoyed that - he liked his own company. He was a loner."" Maureen and David had a pregnancy which ended in miscarriage. She says he changed greatly after that, he became withdrawn and quiet. Unbeknown to Maureen, David put his house up for sale in 2005. It sold on 4 October 2006, and he left for Pakistan on 6 October - not California as Maureen had mysteriously been told. His departure, it seems, was part of a plan - not a sudden disappearance. For Detective Sergeant John Coleman, this was one of the hardest cases of his career. He never dreamed it would remain unsolved for so long. Early in the investigation, he believed a titanium plate that had been fitted during an operation on the man's leg would provide the answer. This type of plate is only used in Pakistan, so police only needed to track down the surgeon. After months of searching, they drew a blank. But as the anniversary of the death of the man on the moor was approaching, there was a breakthrough. Initial inquiries had also focused on Ealing in West London, as it was here that the man was caught on CCTV. Because of the Pakistan connection and the fact that he had been seen walking from the direction of South Ealing, which is a few stops along from Heathrow Airport, DS Coleman had a hunch. He asked for all the passenger lists from Pakistan to be examined from the days before he was first spotted on CCTV in London. The task was to find someone who fitted the profile of a white male between 65 and 75, possibly travelling alone. At first, the person asked to do this failed to find a match. But as the anniversary approached, he revisited the case. ""That's a hell of a piece of work. Thousands and thousands of people. The tenacity of that officer,"" he says. A match was found. The man was British, so police contacted the UK Passport Agency and obtained a copy of his passport photograph. Although the picture was 10 years old, there was a resemblance. ""You can imagine the excitement in Oldham CID,"" says DS Coleman. CCTV images from Lahore airport came through on the anniversary of the death. The police had found their man. A DNA sample from a family member was needed for confirmation. Police checked the electoral roll in London. When this failed to turn up any leads, they turned to genealogy records. Eventually, they found David's mother Sylvia, who suffers from dementia and lives in a care home in London. The trail led to Maureen, who telephones the care home to check up on her former friend's mother every day. From David's visa for Pakistan, the police have been able to fill in some blanks. The found out that he set up home in an area called Hassan Town in Lahore. Neighbours say he kept himself to himself. One said he used to read all the time and visit the local internet cafe. ""He never bothered anybody, though local lads teased him at times,"" one told the BBC. ""He was nice to his neighbours and ate food sent by his next door neighbours. You would see him going for a walk in the morning, dressed in a tracksuit."" Another recalled him returning from the hospital after he had the plate fitted. ""His friend requested me to arrange for his food while he was on bed-rest,"" said Ejaz Ahmad. ""So my family looked after him, our children used to bring him fruit and go to the bakery to buy him cake or pastry. So he was in bed for 15 to 20 days and then he started walking slowly."" Another said that he was a Muslim and that David told him that he had converted in 1996. ""Now, I don't know whether he said this in view of the treatment meted out to Christians here, as they are made to eat in separate pots from us, Muslims, but he definitely told me that he was a Muslim."" The police say there is no evidence to suggest that he had converted to Islam. On Thursday 10 December, David Lytton sat in seat 25C on a Pakistan International Airlines Flight from Lahore arriving at London Heathrow at 15:30. He was met at the airport by a friend, who he had known for some 35 years. They ate a meal before the friend dropped David off at the Travelodge in Ealing. ""His friend indicated that since David had not been in the UK for some time, he wanted to spend some time - weeks or months travelling around and seeing the sights,"" says DS Coleman. Although he booked into the hotel for five nights, David only stayed one. And in keeping with the mysterious nature of this story, police have been unable to locate the 18kg suitcase that he brought with him from Pakistan. And what about the ""why"". Why did David Lytton travel to Manchester, and then out to the renowned beauty spot? ""I've got all the GP's records - I have records from university - there is no connection to Dovestones,"" says Detective Sergeant Coleman. At the inquest in Manchester, Coroner Simon Nelson said Mr Lytton ""died of his own hand"", but he couldn't be sure whether Mr Lytton had intended to take his own life.

"Whose round is it anyway? Coffee drinking could be overtaking the office tea round as workers search for a caffeine jolt, but the hunt for a clean tea mug still continues in many offices. Freelance journalist Caroline Bullock explores the politics and psychology of the tea round. According to research, when it comes to countering the afternoon energy slump, office workers are switching off the office kettle and opting for High Street coffee. It seems the baristas have raised the bar and our expectations, rendering the cracked mugs and amateur efforts from colleagues increasingly redundant. Yet beyond an improved taste and greater dent in the wallet, it's a move with broader implications, notably the threat to the office tea round. While critics claim the politics and pettiness of this enduring ritual make it irrelevant in the modern workplace, for me it's a process with a purpose. For a start, office life has always involved a degree of artifice, notably the falsehood that everyone is part of one equitable and harmonious team. It's a mantra crudely reinforced in various ways: the shared corporate values, the away days and secret Santas to name a few. Scratch the surface, however, and you can find that the bonhomie is a little contrived. Interestingly, the tea round offers a much-needed reality check in exposing social hierarchies and gender bias, and shows that a good old-fashioned pecking order is still alive and well. Caroline Bullock - burned by tea round etiquette It starts with the person who never makes a drink but is always served one, a move that cements their status as someone far too important for such drudgery. Do the same, however, and you're guilty of office life's greatest felony - having ideas above your station. I speak from experience. New to a demanding role on a newspaper, I appreciated the teas that came on tap, fuelling the pithy headlines and the slog to deadline. Basking in my creative bubble, I didn't have the time or inclination to reciprocate, and figured this was fine as I was following the lead of a male colleague who never returned the favour either. Two weeks later and the team's patience had expired; the tea round took place and I was excluded. Interestingly, my partner in crime continued to enjoy a steady stream of beverages, while I was left parched and indignant with the stark message that some get away with it and others don't - draw your own conclusions. Mounds of mugs are a common sight in offices Further double standards can arise when it comes to the mess created. Soggy mounds of teabags, unwashed mugs, crusty discarded teaspoons - I'm guilty of it all, but my slovenly habits have tended to attract more comment than comparable misdemeanours from male colleagues and usually from other women. For Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester University, this seemingly simple activity reflects the many dynamics in the office around gender and status. ""It's really about the expectations colleagues have of each other and the sociological and psychological factors under the surface,"" he says. ""I still notice in many tea rounds that while men may help make the tea, it is usually the women that do the washing up, or load the dishwasher. ""If I was to observe a tea round for a month I would be able to tell who gets on best and who is the outsider, as well as the fact that a so-called 'team' is very rarely a team."" Lawyer Grace Bennett had to contend with archaic attitudes from two older gentlemen And refreshment faux pas can prevail in other professional capacities. Lawyer Grace Bennett at Vista Employer Services recalls how a recent networking event was blighted by ""dinosaur attitudes"". ""I walked towards the self-service coffee machine and a man in his 60s standing in front of it said to his male colleague, 'Great, now there's a woman here maybe we can get a cup of tea.' I ignored it and assumed he was joking but when I had my drink in my hand he said perfectly seriously: 'Is that drink for me?' ""If I'd been less confident that could have really affected me."" Should you socialise with your colleagues? Are office Christmas parties worth it? Does free food make for a happier office? Not surprisingly, where tea rounds still thrive, it seems efforts are being made to avoid potential flashpoints. A recent mandate introduced at GingerMay PR limits tea making to immediate neighbours to end niggles over time-sapping rounds. Elsewhere, the process is getting a more technological revamp. For the team at marketing agency No Brainer, a tea round app is solving brew-based arguments by letting an algorithm select whose turn it is at random. An answer to the UK's productivity puzzle? Then there's the iKettle, which is controlled remotely via a smartphone app, so you can boil it from your desk. Christian Lane, the founder of Smarter, the company behind it, says the product saves two days a year in lost productivity physically waiting in the kitchen for it to boil. Yet while these gadgets breathe new life into a traditional routine, they may struggle to compete with offices that have in-house baristas. Henry Mizel from office-space booking firm Nomad says these amenities are replacing the water cooler as the office focal point for interaction. ""The better the coffee machine, the more likely people will be to make a booking there. To remain competitive, workspaces are having to cater to all needs, including baristas, who will make you anything your heart desires,"" he says. Should you socialise with your colleagues?

"Rakesh Sharma is the only Indian to travel into space Did you meet God? This was a question Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to travel into space, often faced from admirers at home after he returned to Earth in 1984. ""I would say, no, I hadn't met God,"" he says. More than three decades later, fact and fiction blur easily with his modern-day fans when they meet Mr Sharma, 68. ""Now many young mothers introduce me to their kids and tell them, 'this uncle has been to the Moon!'"". But Mr Sharma can never forget the hysteria after he returned from space. He criss-crossed the country and lived in hotels and guest houses. He posed for pictures and gave speeches. Elderly women blessed him; fans tore his clothes and sought autographs. Politicians paraded him in their constituencies for votes; and authorities sent him on holiday to a national park in searing 45C (113F) temperatures. ""It was completely over the top. It left me irritated and tired. I had to keep a smile on my face all the time,"" he recounts. Pioneering Indians is part of the India Direct series. It looks back at men and women  who have helped shape modern India. Other stories from the series: What made these grannies go nude in public? The rape that led to India's sexual harassment law Mr Sharma wears his achievements and fame lightly. He joined India's air force at 21 and began flying supersonic jet fighters. He had flown 21 missions in the 1971 war with Pakistan before his 23rd birthday. By 25, he was a test pilot. He travelled into space at 35, the first Indian and the 128th human to do so. ""I had pretty much done it all before I went into space. So when the opportunity came, I went along. It was that simple."" Mr Sharma spent eight days in a space station in 1984 Mr Sharma (middle) says the celebrations over his space journey were ""over the top"" What is easily forgotten is that Mr Sharma's feat was possibly the only silver lining in what was one of independent India's worst years ever. 1984 saw the Indian army storm the Golden Temple in Punjab to flush out Sikh separatists and the revengekilling of prime minister Indira Gandhi,externalby her Sikh bodyguards. Theanti-Sikh riots,external, the country's worst religious rioting after Partition, convulsed Delhi. And, before the year had ended, thousands of people in the city of Bhopal had beenkilled after toxic gases leaked from a chemical factory, the world's worst industrial accident. In a wounded nation, a young pilot shone as an unlikely beacon of hope. Mrs Gandhi was pushing for an Indian in space before the 1984 general elections, and dialled her closest ally and space race leader, the Soviet Union, for help. The latter asked for a list of candidates. Mr Sharma was picked to undergo a battery of gruelling tests from a reported shortlist of some 50 fighter pilots. Among other things, he was locked up by the air force in a room with artificial lights at an aerospace facility in Bangalore for 72 hours to test for ""latent claustrophobia"". In the end, two of them were selected for the final training in Russia. More than a year before the launch, Mr Sharma and Ravish Malhotra travelled to Star City, a high-security cosmonaut-training facility some 70km (43 miles) from Moscow, to train for space flight as there were no such facilities at home. It was bitterly cold. He trudged in the snow from one building to another - ""It was very Dr Zhivago"". He had to learn Russian quickly as most of the training was in that language. Six to seven hours of language classes every day meant that he had mastered enough Russian in three months. He was put on a carefully controlled diet of local food, capped at 3,200 calories a day. Olympic trainers tested him for strength, speed and endurance, and how his chest stood up to punishing G-forces. A Soviet rocket carried Mr Sharma and two Russian astronauts, Yuri Malyshev and Gennadi Strekalov The three astronauts trained at a cosmonaut facility outside Moscow Midway through the training, he was told he was the chosen one, and Mr Malhotra would serve as backup. ""It wasn't such a big deal, it wasn't very tough,"" says Mr Sharma, modestly. But many, like science writer Pallava Bagla, believe Mr Sharma's feat was a ""huge leap of faith"". ""He came from a country which didn't have a space programme. He didn't dream of becoming an astronaut. But he travelled to an alien environment, endured a harsh climate, learnt a new language, and trained hard. He's a real hero."" On 3 April, a Soviet rocket carrying Mr Sharma and two Russian astronauts, Yuri Malyshev, 42, and Gennadi Strekalov, 43,left Earth,externalfrom a spaceport in the then Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. ""The take-off was boringly routine. We were over-trained by that point,"" Mr Sharma recounts. ""I was the 128th human in space. So I didn't really sweat about it."" Mr Sharma is now among the more than 500 fortunate people who have travelled into space since Yuri Gagarin's single orbit of Earth in 1961. The media gushed how the joint flight was the high noon of the Soviet Union-India friendship. Soviet news agency Tass filed a report saying Mr Sharma's mother, a teacher, had developed a ""general interest"" in the Soviet Union after her son was chosen for the flight in 1982. ""The mission,"" says Mr Sharma, ""was scientific in content, but with a political end at home."" Tragically, Mrs Gandhi would be murdered within eight months, and her son, Rajiv, would sweep the polls at the end of the year on a sympathy wave for his mother. The space flight wasn't needed to fetch votes for the ruling Congress party. Indira Gandhi (middle) wanted to put an Indian in space before a general election Mr Sharma and his fellow astronauts spent nearly eight days in space: grainy TV images from the time show the three men, in grey jumpsuits, floating around in the Salyut 7 space station, and conducting experiments. He became the first human to practice yoga in space - using a harness to stop him from floating around - to find out whether it could better prepare crews adapt for the effects of gravity. He spoke to his family once on a live link with 2,500 people in the audience in a Moscow auditorium. When Mrs Gandhi asked Mr Sharma, on ahazy live link,external, how India looked from space, he delivered a line in Hindi which would have easily become a viral tweet today. ""Sare Jahan Se Acha [The best in the world]"", he said, quoting from a famous poem by Mohammad Iqbal, which he had recited every day in school after the national anthem. ""It was top of recall. There was nothing jingoistic about it. India does look so picturesque from space,"" Mr Sharma told me. Rakesh Sharma retired as a test pilot with the Indian air force ""You've got this huge coastline, the lovely blue ocean on three sides. Then there are the dry plateaus, forests, river plains, golden sands of the desert. The majestic Himalayas looked purple because sunlight cannot get into the valleys. Then there were snow capped mountains. We've got everything."" The New York Timespresciently wrote,externalthat ""India is not likely to have its own manned space programme for a long time, if ever, and Mr Sharma's flight may well be the last by an Indian for a long time."" Thirty-three years later, Mr Sharma remains the only Indian to travel to space. (Indian-American astronaut Kalpana Chawla went into space decades later and and was one of the seven astronauts killed in the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003.) India plans to put a citizen into space using an Indian rocket from Indian soil one day. It has already developed aspace flight suit,externalfor potential astronauts, and successfully tested a crew module dummy flight in the atmosphere. But money is scarce, the home-made launch rocket has to be made flight-ready, astronauts have to be trained and launch facilities built or upgraded. After his space flight, Mr Sharma returned to his life as a jet pilot. He flew Jaguars, and theIndia designed fighter jet Tejas.

"Two important questions arise from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement that she will seek a second independence referendum. First, do voters in Scotland want a second referendum? And second, how might they vote if an independence referendum were to be held any time soon? During recent months, a number of polls have asked people in a variety of different ways whether there should be a second independence referendum within the next couple of years. They have all obtained much the same answer. Around a half say there should not be, while between a third and two-fifths say there should. Indyref2: Your questions answered Most recently, for example, a poll conducted by BMG Research published in Monday's Herald newspaper found that 39% believe that another referendum should be held prior to the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, while 49% are opposed to the idea. People's opinions on the subject tend to depend on their views on the merits of independence in the first place. Around four in five of those who want Scotland to remain part of the UK oppose having a second referendum within the next couple of years, while around two-thirds of those who back independence would like a ballot to be held soon. It is the apparent lack of enthusiasm for a second referendum amongst some supporters that is the main reason why opponents of an early second ballot are apparently in the majority. But that does not mean that most voters think that another ballot should not be held for ""another generation"". Polling conducted by Panelbase for The Sunday Times has found that half of voters either think a referendum should be held during the Brexit negotiations (as the first minister appears to have in mind) or that one should be held once the negotiations have been concluded (that is, just a little later than Ms Sturgeon's proposed timetable). They counterbalance exactly the other half of Scotland which says that a poll should not be held at any point within the next few years. So this polling suggests that Scotland is evenly divided on the principle of having a relatively early second ballot. In short, both sides in the debate about whether a second referendum should be held can find polling evidence that seemingly bolsters their case. In the first independence referendum held in September 2014, 55% of Scots voted to stay in the UK, while 45% supported independence. But how might Scotland vote a second time around? To date, five polls have been conducted since in mid-January Prime Minister Theresa May outlined her vision of the kind of Brexit deal that the UK should seek in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU. Once those who said 'Don't Know' are put to one side, these polls have on average reported that 48% say they would vote 'Yes' to independence, while 52% say they would vote 'No'. So the two sides look as though they are more evenly matched than they eventually proved to be two and a half years ago. Still, Ms Sturgeon is seemingly taking a big gamble in calling for a second independence referendum. It is far from certain that she will win. But equally Mrs May cannot presume that the first minister is bound to lose. Expect an intense and strongly-fought battle if Scotland does indeed go to the polls once again any time soon.

"With FBI Director James Comey cancelling, former Vice-President Biden was a political highlight at the conference In recent years, the annual South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, has been about more than just music, film and technology. Politics keeps seeping into the picture. That's never been more apparent than now, with Donald Trump's presidency dominating the headlines and generating social media waves with every controversial tweet. Former Vice President Joe Biden took the stage in Austin on Sunday afternoon looking tanned and relaxed, a man freed from the burden the Washington political pressure cooker. In an emotional presentation, he spoke of the death of his eldest son, Beau, from cancer and his work since then to help find a cure. The fight against cancer, Biden said, was ""the only bipartisan thing left in America"", and there are ""a lot of decent people"" in politics on both sides of the political divide who want to help. Even while preaching bipartisanship and pledging co-operation with the new Trump administration, however, the former vice-president couldn't help but take a swipe at the current Washington power players, some of whom, he said, don't believe in global warming and the public health benefits of environmental regulation.

Needless to say, the current team in Washington - with its promises to ""deconstruct the administrative state"" - has a decidedly different view of the role of government in US society.

"Students held a walkout to protest the suicide crisis in Woodstock, Ontario in 2016. Suicide among young women is on the rise. When it comes to mental health, is gender the elephant in the room? In early 2016, five teenagers from Woodstock, Ontario killed themselves in just as many months, leaving not only their family but the community as a whole bewildered with grief. ""Everyone was sitting on edge. For a while there, I think we all just sat there wondering when it was going to end,"" says Jenilee Ookcay, a community health worker. Across the country, suicide among teen girls and young women is on the rise, while male suicide in the same age group declines, according to data released by Statistics Canada on Thursday. Health experts have long been concerned with the prevalence of suicide among young men. It has been called a ""silent epidemic"" and for good reason. In 2013, men were three times as likely to kill themselves as women, the latest data shows. Why are so many men at risk for suicide? But while men are still much more likely to kill themselves in Canada, young women are starting to catch up. Over the past decade, the suicide rate among girls has increased by 38%, while male suicide decreased by 34%. The growth has helped level out the gender-gap, with women accounting for 42% of all suicide deaths under 20 in 2013. In 2003, they accounted for just over a quarter. A similar trend can be observed in theUnited States,external, and in 2014, suicide surpassed maternal mortality as the leading cause of death in girls ages 15-19 in the developing world, according to the World Health Organisation. A 2012 report by the Public Health Agency of Canada urged researchers to look at why suicide had declined in teen boys since the 1980s, but not in girls. With the government expected to earmark considerable funds for mental health in the next annual budget, due in mid-March, health experts are wondering if Canada needs to rethink the role of gender in suicide prevention. ""It definitely warrants some really dedicated attention to why there has been such an increase, particularly when we are seeing children and youth dying by suicide,"" says Renee Linklater, director of Aboriginal engagement and outreach at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Canadian Attawapiskat First Nation suicide emergency Secret donor pledges to help with Wapekeka suicide Dr Linklater says she's been concerned about growing suicide rates among young indigenous women for some time, and limited data suggests they are more vulnerable than non-indigenous girls. Data obtained by the BBC for 2015 shows that indigenous women in Ontario are more likely to kill themselves than non-indigenous women. This video can not be played Why are people getting semicolon tattoos? Women made up more than half of all indigenous suicides in 2015 in Ontario, compared with the non-aboriginal population where women made up just one quarter of all suicides. Between 2006 and 2015, the number of female suicides climbed 1.5 times faster in indigenous women than it did for non-indigenous women. Why have so many of Winnipeg's aboriginal girls and women been killed? Dr Linklater says we should be paying more attention to this disparity, and the effects that gender and colonialism have on young indigenous women, whom she says experience ""double oppression"". Researchers in Canada and abroad are not sure why suicide is rising among young women. Some have suggested it could be because women are using deadlier methods. Others say it might be because coroners are reporting female suicide more. In Canada, women make three to four times as many suicide attempts as men do. Studies indicate that there is a strong link between a history of sexual abuse and suicide attempts. Yet gender is rarely discussed when we talk about youth suicide, says Ms Oockay, who works in suicide prevention in Woodstock. ""When we train our community members, if the trends are shifting, we want to know that,"" she says. Arielle Sheftall, a researcher at the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in the United States, says that more research is needed into the role that gender and age play in suicide prevalence. The town of Woodstock joined together after a series of teen suicides in 2016 ""Research has shown that the age of puberty is getting younger, and the age of onset for psychiatric disorders especially depression, is highly correlated with the age of puberty,"" says Ms Sheftall. Another culprit might be sexism, research into suicide in developing countries suggests. Dr Suzanne Petroni, the senior director for gender, population and development at the International Center for Research on Women, believes that lack of opportunity and rigid gender roles may be to blame for the high rate of young female suicides in developing countries, like India. Cybervictim Rehtaeh Parsons legacy ""Rampant sexism, harmful gender norms, perceptions of girls not being valued as anything other than a wife and a mother, very likely is contributing to mental-health problems and suicide,"" she told the BBC. These harmful stereotypes, or ""visions of what they should be, but aren't"", have only been amplified by the spread of social media around the globe, Dr Petroni says. This video can not be played The father of cyberbully victim Rehtaeh Parsons, speaks to the BBC about his grief a year after her death. Although Woodstock is far from the developing world, this explanation rings true to Ms Ookcay, who teaches suicide prevention. ""Our youth live in a world that the pressure and stress is way different than it ever has been. I see high levels of perfectionism and the need to be on it all the time, and be the best at everything you do,"" she told the BBC. In Woodstock, the town is still grieving a year after the suicide crisis. Everyone from hairdressers to school principles have asked how they can help, Ms Ookcay says, and the students themselves are reaching out both to get help and help others. ""I think it could happen anywhere, and it's unfortunate that it happened here,"" she says. ""But I'm a big picture thinker, and I do think it's about the triumph from the tragedy.""

" Marine Le Pen's political awakening came at the age of eight, when she survived a bombing at her family's Paris home. Five kilograms of dynamite had been placed on the landing outside the apartment at 9 Villa Poirier.  The explosion ripped open the entire front of the building.  A baby in the next-door flat fell five floors and was saved by the branches of a tree. In her autobiography, the woman who took over the leadership of France's National Front (FN) from her father describes the chaos, the smoke and debris. She and her two sisters “were on our knees shivering, holding hands, praying with the fervour of despair… when we heard the voice of our father shouting, 'Girls, girls, are you alive?'” Bomb damage at Villa Poirier,Paris, 1976(Getty Images) The mystery of who tried to kill Jean-Marie Le Pen and his family on the night of 1 November 1976 is still unsolved. At the time the FN was just four years old, a fringe party of the far right including some on the anti-Semitic extreme. For Marine Le Pen the attack changed everything.  The family home was destroyed.  She lost school-friends, whose parents were too scared now to let them near her “dangerous” father. Jean-Marie Le Pen with daughters Yann and Marine, early 1970s(Getty Images) More profoundly she came to understand that she and her family were different - they would never be treated as normal people.  Instead of sympathy, there was hostility. Acordon sanitairewas created around us - don't go near the Le Pens.” Today Marine Le Pen is often described as having a hard exterior. “After everything she went through in her youth, she built herself a shell,” says her friend and senior FN colleague Steeve Briois. Pejorative adjectives likecassant(brittle) andclivant(divisive) are commonly applied. But at heart there is that emotional toughness, a determined self-reliance whose origins surely lie in the difficult psychological conditions of her childhood. Without that toughness, she could not have pushed the FN to its current unprecedented heights. She has battled successfully through the first round of France's presidential election and will now face centrist Emmanuel Macron in the final run-off on 7 May. And without that toughness she could certainly not have achieved the act that made that success possible - the symbolic “killing” of her father. On a Friday evening in France's rural east, Marine Le Pen has taken her election campaign to a community hall in the small town of Clairvaux-les-Lacs. Before a mainly working-class, mainly middle-aged audience of 300, she develops the themes at the heart of her party's 144-point manifesto - from prioritising jobs for French nationals to “automatic” expulsion of undocumented immigrants. FN supporters gather to hear Marine Le PenClairvaux-les-Lacs, France, February 2017(Getty Images) Marine Le Pen talks with practised confidence. In a previous life she was a lawyer who defended in the Paris courts the sort of immigrants she now wants expelled. This is her sixth year as leader of a party traditionally seen as far-right. It is also her second tilt at the presidency - she won third place with nearly 18% in 2012. That bettered anything her father achieved, even in 2002, when he came second to Jacques Chirac on an anti-immigrant, law-and-order platform. Even more is expected of her now. Watching Marine in action, you can understand the appeal. There is a hint of the “everywoman” about her. People like the lived-in, authentic persona, the sense she gives of combining hard work with the aura of someone who knows how to have a good time. A political player in France for years, her message - anti-immigration, anti-EU - is consistent and unchanged. Out here in the sticks, people adore the fact that she is so hated by the establishment in Paris. Marine owes Jean-Marie. In daughter as in father there is the same pugnacity - ready for a scrap with a hostile world. There is the same plain-speaking humour - the French call itla gouaille.To cheers, she declares: There are two things I want to give back to you, the people. Your voice... and your money!” Then there is the physical resemblance, with the strong features and the blonde hair. Marine was the third and last Le Pen daughter, and her parents may well have been hoping for a boy. Today Marine's mother Pierrette says her daughter is just like Jean-Marie with long hair. Jean-Marie himself puts it more crudely: “She is me with breasts!” But today Marine and her father are entirely estranged. The rift is not a charade to help along her political career. It is a total breakdown. The pair have not spoken for more than two years. “In this family, politics is stronger than blood,” says journalist Olivier Beaumont, author of a book on the Le Pens. “Jean-Marie could not bear to see someone else, even his own daughter, taking control of the party he had created and controlled for 40 years.” It was like a Greek tragedy unfolding, and it ended like a Greek tragedy - in a symbolic parricide.” She did an honourable thing, argues Marine's close friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “For the sake of politics and for the sake of France, she did the hardest thing a child can do - she cut the cord with her father.” The final break came in April 2015, when in an interview on French radio Jean-Marie Le Pen did what Marine had long feared he would do. He repeatedle détail. Mentionle détailto anyone in the National Front today and their face hardens.They know exactly what it means. In September 1987 a dark moment became a turning-point in the party's history. In their biography of the man, Pierre Pean and Philippe Cohen call it “the day Le Pen became Le Pen”. He was asked in an interview about a notorious Holocaust denier. Did he share the man's ideas? In his reply, the FN chief was at his ambiguous worst: “I do not say that the gas chambers did not exist. I never personally saw them. I have never particularly studied the issue, but I believe they are a point of detail in the history of World War Two.” Marine and Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2014 before their estrangement(Getty Images) Jean-Marie Le Pen never escaped from the aftershock of that remark - downplaying the Holocaust. It was a gift to his enemies, who now had evidence that the FN was anti-Semitic. Worse, Jean-Marie reacted to the hostility by digging in further. Over the years there were further verbal provocations, and he amassed more than 15 separate convictions in the courts. Then came the 2015 interview when he saidle détailall over again. Marine Le Pen looked on with horror. She disassociated herself from the remarks. Over the years she had become increasingly convinced that her father was incapable of winning power. Worse, maybe he never wanted power. In 2002 Marine had observed with satisfaction her father's first round success in the presidential race. But what left more of an impression was his utter wipe-out in round two. With just 17.8% to Jacques Chirac's 82.2%, Jean-Marie had barely made any advance at all from his first round score. Voters had united against him. Jean-Marie Le Pen's miserable result in the 2007 election (fourth place on 10.4%) set the seal on his decline. Maybe his real raison d'etre was to be a perpetual gadfly on the back of the French body politic, irritating but irrelevant. Time and again after she was elected as FN leader in 2011, Marine Le Pen would make clear her desire to “normalise” the party and make it electable. But time and again Jean-Marie grabbed the headlines with incendiary statements. After his repeat ofledétailin 2015, he was suspended by the party and soon expelled, though technically he remains its honorary president. A family-political drama had reached its climax. The very qualities he had inculcated in Marine by example - the cussedness, the pugnacity, the refusal to back down - were turned against him. Now Marine Le Pen is everywhere, and so are her lieutenants. As the presidential election draws near, Florian Philippot, Nicolas Bay, David Rachline, her partner Louis Aliot, and a handful of others saturate the morning TV talk shows. They are practised, presentable, professional. Philippot, her close adviser, has his own YouTube channel where he appears in an office kitchen dubbed the Marine cafe, railing against the latest factory closure or European free-trade deal. For years the party's far-right views were regarded by the French media as toxic, but the boycott is history. “A few years ago when I first interviewed Marine Le Pen, I got a kind of frisson with the hairs sticking up at the back of my neck. I felt I was flirting with the untouchable,” says journalist Elisabeth Levy. So is it truly a party like any other? Ask most observers, and they will say that the process ofdédiabolisation(de-demonisation) is genuine and more or less complete. Young FN supporters, 2017(Getty Images) The older generation with nostalgia for the collaborationist wartime Vichy regime, or for France's colonial rule of Algeria, has moved on. Racist comments are outlawed and people who make them are chased from the FN. In 2010, before being elected leader, Marine Le Pen was roundly criticised after comparing Muslims praying in the street to the German occupation. Now she has softened her tone, saying she does not regard Islam as “incompatible” with French democracy. The FN has also tried to build bridges with the Jewish community. Meanwhile across the West, other nationalist parties - in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere - have emerged which make the FN much less of a French exception. Events too have worked in the FN's favour. The jihadist attacks on Paris and Nice are part of it. But just as much is the popular disillusionment with the Paris and Brussels elites, and the growing fear of what they call in Francele déclassement- the loss of economic and social status. People feel poor. “We treat the FN like we would any other politicians,” says Beatrice Houchard who covers the party for L'Opinion newspaper.“No favours - but nor do we go out of our way to find something negative to say.” And with acceptance has come electoral success. After victories in municipal, European and regional elections, Marine can arguably claim to lead the country's most popular political party. Such an idea would have been laughable just a few years ago. We are now the number one party among the youth. We are the number one party for the working class. We are the number one party for farmers.” “We are making big gains in the civil service,” continues Lacapelle - Marine Le Pen's close friend. “In the police and army, and we are not doing badly among small business-owners. We represent a cross-section of France.” But unlike nationalist parties in some other countries, the FN does not do well among the over-65s. And if normalisation of the party is complete why does a shadow still persist over the FN's name? Do the words National Front and Le Pen have a perpetual power to alienate? Its critics strenuously argue the party's ethos is unchanged. For Laurent Joffrin, editor of left-wing daily Liberation, the FN still favours the insider and scapegoats the outsider. Today the implicit accusation they direct at Muslims is exactly the same as the one they used to direct at Jews.” “That these people are in some essential way different, and therefore dangerous to national unity,” he says. The persistent accusation is that in its modern, “normalised” form the party is not being entirely frank - that in private, members are far more bigoted than they ever let on openly, and that their public discourse is in some way coded. ""Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!""Graffiti next to FN posters in southern France, 2016(Getty Images) Veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, who has covered every presidential election since 1965, says the FN still has an indirect way of attacking Muslims. When Marine Le Pen champions the exclusion of religion from the public sphere it is “a smokescreen for anti-immigration” he says. It is Muslim veils, not Christian crosses, that she has in mind. Rejection of Muslims has wide support, especially among the working class, according to Cecile Cornudet of Les Echos newspaper. So she uses secularism, orlaïcité,and defence of women as a way of being anti-Islam. Demonstration against the FN in Tours, 2011(EPA) The FN's opponents point out that Marine still has on her staff former members of a far-right militant group called GUD. Many in the Muslim community do not trust her. Iman Mestaoui, a 25-year-old clothes designer of Moroccan parents, sees Marine Le Pen as merely a more presentable version of her father. “She's definitely a racist, but she hides it better. She hides the Islamophobia. She is totally scary,” she says. But this “just-scratch-beneath-the-surface” argument has its limits. If people insist over and again that they do not have a particular opinion, is it fair to judge them by saying that you think they do? In France they call that aprocès d'intention- putting people on trial for views you tell them that they have. People who resent the allegation that they are racist are voting FN to thumb their noses at the establishment. As for Marine herself, even her enemies - or most of them - stop short of saying she is personally racist. Montretout is a three-storey, mid-19th Century pile in a gated community on a hill above the Seine that overlooks Paris from the west.  It sits in its garden at the end of a private road next to several other houses of similar vintage. This is where the Le Pens lived from 1976, after Jean-Marie inherited the property from a cement magnate who was a political supporter. The Le Pen family mansion - MontretoutSt Cloud, near Paris It was a highly controversial gift - the late magnate's brother contested it - but in the end the house became an integral part of the Le Pen saga. “It is very symbolic. Aloof, on a hill, with this magnificent view over the capital - it is just like Jean-Marie himself, who was always looking on the system from outside,” says Olivier Beaumont, whose book on the Le Pens is called In the Hell of Montretout. It's quite scary-looking - a bit like the house in Psycho. Which fits too, because the Le Pens have always given the establishment the shivers.” Even today the house is part of the story. Marine carried on living at the Le Pen estate into her 40s, in a bungalow in the grounds. In the summer of 2014 she finally moved out. It was at the height of the row with her father. “The things I saw there you would not believe! She and her father were 100m apart but communicating via intermediaries. It was vaudeville,” says a former senior adviser to Marine, who asks not to be identified. Again, the final straw could not have been more symbolic. It came when one of Jean-Marie's dogs killed his daughter's adored cat, Artemis. For Marine, who sometimes says she wishes she could give it all up and open a cattery, it was all too much. Today Montretout is home on the second floor to Jean-Marie's second daughter Yann, mother of the rising young FN star Marion Marechal Le Pen. The eldest Le Pen daughter Marie-Caroline is, like Marine, estranged from her father and lives elsewhere.  In her case the split goes back to 2002 - they haven't talked since. Jean-Marie Le Penwith daughters Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine in themid-1990s(Getty Images) Jean-Marie no longer lives in the house but he comes every day to his office on the first floor.  Meanwhile, in the bungalow, there now resides his former wife Pierrette, mother of the three girls. The same Pierrette who left him in 1984 swearing he was the devil incarnate, and then posed nude in Playboy as an act of revenge. Indeed it was Pierrette's sudden disappearance when Marine was 16 that formed the second trauma in the FN leader's life. Her mother left without explanation, and Marine had no contact with her for the next 15 years. Pierrette and Jean-Marie Le Penshortly before their splitin 1984(Getty Images) In her autobiographyA contre flots(Against the Waves) Marine states: “For a month and a half I vomited every day. I was incapable of feeding myself… What I suffered was the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: my mother did not love me.” Marine Le Pen's inner toughness stems from this ultimate desertion, as much as the bombing. She learned to cope. Her father told her to “keep things in perspective. 'Remember,' he said: 'You could be naked in the snow in a war.'” It was hard living with the Le Pen name. In her book, Marine speaks of the teasing at school, and of the betrayal by teachers and even Catholic priests who made sure she knew how much they loathed her father. As she tried to make her way as a lawyer she was boycotted by many of her contemporaries who objected to her father's politics. She ended up doing business solely for the party. Marine Le Pen working as a lawyer, 1995(Getty Images) All of this created a sense of injustice. She could not see in her father the monster constantly vilified by politicians and press. So gradually she started taking up the political cudgels herself. “If you are called Le Pen, eventually politics will come and catch you,” says her niece Marion Marechal Le Pen. “With a name like that, there is nothing else you can do!” But there is another aspect of Marine Le Pen's upbringing in Montretout which bears on the politician she is today. Because far from being the pillars of bourgeois respectability that many suppose them to have been, the Le Pen parents lived back then in a state of chaos. There were parties and endless dinners for Jean-Marie's cronies. He and Pierrette were constantly travelling. More and more the girls were left to their own devices. Marine went to a local state school, and there she mixed with boys and girls born like her in that highly significant year - 1968. 1968 was the year that changed France. It was the student protests in Paris versus the intransigent President Charles de Gaulle. Politically, the regime held. But otherwise the country was transformed. For supporters it meant a more tolerant, diverse society. For opponents it was the start of the left wing's half century of cultural hegemony. Today Marine Le Pen is a nationalist. She is unabashedly opposed to immigration. But there is no hint in her of the far-right ideology that clung to members of her father's generation. According to Laurent Joffrin of Liberation,Marine's views are eclectic and opportunistic. “Nationalists are always like that - whatever is for the nation is right,” he says. Thus in her autobiography written in 2005 she argued against the 35-hour week, but now she supports it. FN ideas about fixing the retirement age at 60 are interchangeable with those of the far left. The influence of her generation is key. “I noticed working with her that when a question came up her first reflex was a reflex of the left,” says the former adviser to Marine, who does not want to be named. “She does not have right-wing reflexes. For me, right-wing people are people who value liberty over equality. And left-wing people are the opposite. Well, Marine always chose equality over liberty.” - EU renegotiation with Brussels followed by a referendum - 15,000 new police and 40,000 new prison places - 35-hour working week and retirement age fixed at 60 - Legal immigration cut to 10,000 per year - Automatic expulsion of undocumented immigrants - Priority for French nationals in social housing Most noticeably it is on social matters that Marine Le Pen is a million miles from the caricature of the far-right traditionalist. She refused to join the movement against gay marriage, which brought millions on to the streets in 2013, and she has several gay advisers, notably Florian Philippot. Then again, Jean-Marie's long-standing personal assistant is also a gay man. And if she is religious in a loose kind of way, she is scathing in her book about literalist interpreters of Catholicism. She is twice divorced and angrily defends women's right to abortion, although she regards it as a sad necessity. Contrast that with the opinions of that other denizen of Montretout - Marine's niece Marion. Marine Le Pen and Marion Marechal Le Pen in 2016(Getty Images) Marion Marechal Le Pen, one of the FN's two MPs, was born in 1990. One of her closest friends is Madeleine de Jessey, spokeswoman for the pro-Catholic family-values and anti-abortion movement Sens Commun. Though they love each other deeply - Marine was a second mother, says Marion - their politics are very different. According to Marion: “I am from the generation of the anti-May 1968. My generation is reacting against all the ideological deconstruction that happened after the student rebellion. We want principles, values, mentors - everything in fact that negates May '68. “For Marine the cultural victory of May '68 dominated her childhood and adolescence. But today things are switching over.” Marion has another big difference from her aunt. She still has a good relationship with Jean-Marie. In fact they dote on each other. Jean-Marie Le Pen will be 89 this year.  He moves more slowly than he used to, and he is a little hard of hearing.  But his voice booms as powerfully as ever, punctuated by seafaring metaphors and guffaws of laughter. “Young people on the right,” he says, “are so much more radical than their parents.” His first-floor study at Montretout is full of memorabilia from a lifetime of incident - Russian icons, a model ship, a portrait of a young Le Pen in officer's uniform and eye-patch, a massive set of binoculars trained on Paris to the east. Jean-Marie Le Pen in his study at Montretout The sea is a constant motif in Le Pen's life - one little-known fact is that he introduced the duffle coat to France. He bought it in a navy surplus store in Plymouth for £2 after a trans-Channel yacht race in the early 1950s. No-one in Paris had seen one before. He's willing to talk at length about his daughter Marine. Despite their falling out, was he nonetheless happy at her success? “But think how much better she would be doing if she had not excluded me from the party!  Right now she is on 27%. With me involved she would be on 35%,” he says. She is reaping today the benefits of all the work I carried out over 40 years of great hardship.” “Maybe by getting rid of me she wanted to make some kind of gesture to the establishment. “But I still represent something in this land. And if she brought me back into the fold, I would bring with me all the radical formations of the right and far right who are now outside her compass.” For Jean-Marie, a single person represents all that has gone wrong with the party -  Marine's close adviser Florian Philippot. Marine Le Pen with Florian Philippot(Getty Images) Philippot is - after Marine - the FN's most prominent public figure. He is anénarque.In other words he went to the ENA, the administration school that churns out members of the French establishment and, most importantly, he is a man of the nationalist left. Largely under his influence, the FN has shifted its economic policies to overt protection of the working class. Jean-Marie says: “For him to have such preponderant influence, for him to monopolise the message… that is wrong.” But Jean-Marie seems happier talking about the past. He is a rebel by nature. In his own eye he is someone who exposes establishment hypocrisy. The roots of his tempestuous career are at the end of World War Two, when Jean-Marie felt that the national story, dominated by the movement of liberation hero Charles de Gaulle, and by the Communists, was a sham. Later he fought in France's last imperial wars - Indochina, Suez, Algeria - and became its youngest member of parliament behind the shopkeeper-turned-populist leader Pierre Poujade. Jean-Marie, even now an MEP, voted against the Treaty of Rome setting up the EU in 1957. The EU - for Le Pen - was one of the great betrayals. Algeria was the other. After a brutal civil war in Algeria, De Gaulle was instrumental in accepting that France would have to give up its colony. After independence, the vast majority of the European settlers - the pieds noirs - ended up in France. Le Pen tells a story to show that he has no bigotry - how he insisted on proper burial rites for dead Egyptian soldiers during the Suez campaign in 1956. But what about the question ofle détail? “Ok. Thedétail.Thedétailwas in 1987. Then it came back in 2015. That's not exactly every day! “To my knowledge no-one has provided proof to contradict what I said.” I said the gas chambers are a detail of the history of the war. That seems to me indisputable.” But wasn't he hinting that the gas chambers were insignificant? He avoids the question. “My dear sir, if we are to judge people on the basis of what wesaythat they think - that is one of the definitions of tyranny.” And how does he feel about rifts with two daughters? “Mon cher monsieur,” he leans forward. “It is life! Life is not a smooth tranquil stream. It has cataracts, it has obstacles.” “I am accustomed to adversity. For 60 years I have rowed against the current. Never once have we had the wind at our backs! Always we have had to sail into the gale - always the spray in our faces! No indeed, one thing we never got used to was the easy life!” At this point he is laughing his head off. Marine Le Pen has not had an easy time of it either. Her title for the autobiography - Against the Waves-nods to the favourite Le Pen image of the battling sailor. Jean-Marie's father was a Breton fisherman who drowned after his boat hit a German mine. The difference is that while Jean-Marie seemed to care little about failure - relishing the thrill of the struggle - Marine has made success her watchword. The electoral system has always been an obstacle for the FN.  Only once - between 1986 and 1988 when there was a brief period of proportional representation - have they had more than one or two deputies in the National Assembly. But with Marine at the helm things are changing. National Front share of vote in French elections In addition to the two MPs, the party has 20 MEPs in Strasbourg and many hundreds of local councillors. FN or FN-affiliated mayors control 11 towns. FN bastions are concentrated in two areas - the far north and the far south. And two different political traditions are now feeding into party's electorate.

In Henin-Beaumont, a few miles south of Lille, Marine's friend Steeve Briois has been mayor since 2014. This is an ultra-depressed former mining town, whose last industries - Samsonite cases and metal production - have long since relocated abroad. The town centre is dominated by a vast modern church, currently under renovation. The only eateries are Middle Eastern grills. The beggars are locals. Like all of this region, Henin-Beaumont has always voted left. Until recently the Socialists took 60% of the vote and the Communists another 20%. In his office Briois sits beneath a bust of the early 20th Century Socialist hero Jean Jaures. The statement is clear - that in FN eyes the left has betrayed its origins and its people. The argument is often made that the FN today is taking over where the old French Communist Party (PC) left off. Back in the 1950s the PC too could claim to be the country's largest party. But it never rose above 25% in the polls, and in the end withered into irrelevance. Derelict industrial buildingHenin-Beaumont, northern France Jean-Marie Le Pen once said that “communists are good patriots who just don't know it”, and it is obvious in Henin-Beaumont that the same working-class people who once voted far left now feel the FN is their natural home. The FN's language of values, education, protection for industry and hatred of global finance all goes down very well indeed. “I am no fan of communism - but in the 1950s the PC was intensely patriotic,” says Briois. “Look at their posters from back then. It was all: Produce in France. Keep it French. That I can identify with.” Steeve Briois in Henin-Beaumont(Getty Images) The soft-spoken Briois is popular in the town. “For years we had elites in the town hall. People decked out with diplomas and all sorts of expertise. And the place was a disaster,” he says. “Then along I come with virtually no qualifications. And we are doing the job OK. It goes to show that the people may not be as stupid as you think.” In the main square, Dominique Vignon, a 53-year-old social worker, is among several people who back him up. “My first vote was for Mitterrand in 1981, and I have voted on the left in every election since. But the left has betrayed us. The Socialists are right-wing. “I concede that the FN label shocks some people. But since Briois came to power the only things that have changed are that the taxes have come down and the place is better run. There is no discrimination. The North Africans are still on their market stalls.” Almost directly due south and 600 miles away, the historic town of Beziers is another FN stronghold. Or to be more accurate, FN-affiliated. The town's mayor Robert Menard came to power with the support of the party but he is not a member. Menard is a controversial character. Originally on the far-left of French politics, he chose to run his home town of Beziers for the nationalist right because he says “the world has changed… I could not look at the reality and pretend it was otherwise”. Robert Menard, mayor of Beziers(EPA) Menard has a terrible press in France. Some of his posters are deliberately provocative, and he once drew up an ethnic list of the town's schools, revealing that two-thirds of children were Muslim. His attempt to set up a volunteer civilian militia to patrol the town's streets was struck down by the courts. But he is popular in Beziers, a town built on wine wealth from the late 19th Century. On a walkabout on the famous promenade he is buttonholed by well-wisher after well-wisher, among them an Algerian boutique owner. Robert Menard talks to voters in Beziers
, southern France(EPA) Chrystele Crouton and Florence Boucard, a couple from Paris and Brittany who run theHôtel Particuliernear the town centre, are lavish in their praise. And they are far from being natural FN voters. “It is remarkable what he has done. In a few months the place has been transformed. On the promenade, it was disgusting. There were drug-dealers and drunks. But now people are coming back. It's alive again.” Property taxes were lowered. Old buildings were restored. Bus stop in Beziers, southern France(EPA) Beziers has been transformed by immigration, with many town-centre houses now divided into flats and inhabited by people of Maghrebi (North African) origin. On the outskirts is an estate called La Deveze, which has a reputation for drugs, arms-trafficking and radical Islam. Menard, who is apied-noir- someone of European descent born in French Algeria - lived in La Deveze as a boy. “Back then La Deveze meant social progress. There were Arabs there, pieds-noirs,and metropolitan French. And we all got along. The first thing the Algerian mothers did when they arrived in France was take off their headscarves. The fathers would smack the kids if they heard them talking Arabic on the street,” he says. Now he says you couldn't force him to live there. Stairwell by stairwell, he says, North Africans, Turks and French Roma (gypsies) live in separation. For Menard, the French social model has broken down. He thinks immigration has to stop completely so that the country can do what it can to integrate those that are here. The state school system - in which large numbers of children speak more Arabic than French - needs urgent attention. Anti-migrant poster in Beziers, southern France(Getty Images) And he denies that he only gets “white” votes. “Do you think I would be mayor if Maghrebis did not vote for me? Do you know why they vote for me? One, I am anti-gay marriage, and so are they. And two, I am authoritarian, and they would like to be too.” Both Menard in Beziers and Briois in Henin-Beaumont reject the argument that there are two National Fronts. One ex-communist in the north, left-wing in inspiration. The other ex-pied noir in the south, right-wing and more focused on national identity. The emphasis may be different, but at heart they see no difference at all. Friends of Marine Le Pen say that one of her familiar gestures is what you might call the fruit-machine pull. A downward tug of the right arm, fist clenched, in imitation of a person playing a one-armed bandit. In English it might be accompanied by the word “kerching!”. She has been making the gesture a lot recently. Because the kerchings keep on coming. “At exactly the moment Marine completed her de-demonisation process, events started happening on the world stage that push voters in her direction,” says columnist Cecile Cornudet. Brexit and Donald Trump's victory are two pieces of news that FN strategists could have dreamed of only in their wildest imaginings. “The UK is our best advertisement,” says Marine's friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “As for Trump... if it is OK for an American president to push for protection and immigration controls, then it is OK in France as well.” Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage with Donald Trump in August 2016,Mississippi, USA(AP) But one question keeps coming back. How far-right is the National Front? In an FN-run France, walls go up. Foreigners and foreign goods are kept out. Brussels is pushed to the margin. The franc returns, and France comes first. According to veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, it is “a former party of the far right that has become a populist party with instincts that are xenophobic and authoritarian”. For the party's Steeve Briois, “far-right is not a term we accept. It makes an automatic link with Hitler, which is why our enemies use it. We prefer patriotic, protectionist, national. Not national-ist. That sounds aggressive. And populist we like too.” In its economic plan the FN has swung far to the left, with anti-austerity and protectionist policies that are a clear signal to the working class. That leftward shift prompted the resignation of the former adviser to Marine Le Pen, who says the FN is “nationalist, populist and socialist. Not national-socialist - that has certain historical connotations. But social-nationalist.” What everyone would agree on is that the FN has built its programme around the idea of the nation - “national” identity and values. Marine Le Pen casting her votein France's 2015 regional elections(EPA) Marine Le Pen says she is “not against immigrants, but against immigration” - because any nation needs first to look after the people who are its citizens. But for the FN's enemies, the nation-first answer is wrong, dangerous and a betrayal of France's mission to the world. “It is about universal values,” says Liberation's Joffrin. “Do they exist or not?  I understand that when times are bad people want to return to their roots. That is why this national ideology is returning.” But our duty is to go above that - to think of the values that matter for all human beings. The trouble is that these days, that is a very hard sell.” In the West - it seems - the nation is returning, a political idea on which the National Front has had a monopoly in France for more than a generation. For journalist Elisabeth Levy, a leading light in the “new right” philosophical movement, “it is not that France has become Le Penist, reality has become Le Penist”. “In every country we are confronted with the same question - how do you integrate millions of immigrants? And the answer is you can't - not if they keep on coming.” In other countries populist, nationalist parties have grown up, without triggering the same gasps of horror. Part of the reason for the alarm is that the FN has always had a terrible press. In France it has suited successive governments, especially on the left, to caricature the party in the worst possible light. But there is a difference in France - and that is history. The roots of the FN lie in the country's troubled past - a past in which ideology and violence have often advanced hand in hand. Outbursts of civil unrest remain a part of the French psyche. The 1871 Paris Commune was followed by the anti-Semitic Dreyfus affair in 1894. The wartime Vichy regime was followed by the fighting in Algeria. In France people take sides. They believe in ideas. And if the conditions are right they will fight for them. That is why it all feels more real here. A Marine Le Pen presidency could well spark violence on a scale far greater than the protests she currently attracts. The FN has no experience when it comes to taking on the task of government. And Marine has no allies, which makes election success all the harder. Thecordon sanitaireremains in place. But her father knows a thing or two. Watch forles évènements,  he says.Things happen.

"Arnold Palmer, a winner of seven majors and seen as golf's most influential figure, died at the age of 87 on 25 September 2016 On the day Arnold Palmer passed away, Rory McIlroy collected such riches in prize money that the knock-on effect was a ""tsunami"" of cash tumbling into the bank account of his caddie. That's how JP Fitzgerald described his feelings after checking his balance and finding financial rewards for helping his boss win the Tour Championship and with it the lucrative FedEx Cup last September. Fitzgerald earned around $1.5m (Â£1.2m) that week. He performs an invaluable role - but remember he is a caddie not a player. By contrast, back in the 1950s and '60s it took the great Palmer around 15 years of swashbuckling, captivating competition to come anywhere close to amassing that figure. Of course, we are talking vastly different eras and inflationary forces have abounded since Palmer's heyday. But no-one did more to popularise professional golf than the man still referred to as 'The King'. Arnie's Army, as his support base was known, was a global following attracted by this most charismatic of characters. Palmer brought attention and money and became one of the world's most famous people. He made golf sexy and laid the foundations for the riches enjoyed by today's players, their caddies and the rest of their entourages. Rory McIlroy will feature as one of 14 players ranked in the world's top 25 at the Bay Hill Club this weekend This week, the PGA Tour stages the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill for the first time since golf lost one of its greatest figures. Palmer died awaiting heart surgery at the age of 87on 25 September last year. The great man will never be far from the minds of those competing in Orlando this week and, despite a ludicrously congested schedule, a fitting field has been assembled. There were worries that the biggest names would be under-represented and last week former FedEx Cup winner Billy Horschel tweeted his concern. ""Disappointing. Totally understand schedule issues. But 1st year without AP. Honor an icon! Without him wouldn't be in position we are today."" And yes, world number one Dustin Johnson along with major winners Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth and Adam Scott are absent, but 14 of the world's top 25 will tee it up in Florida this week. It is a respectable field headlined by numbers two and three in the rankings - Jason Day and McIlroy - along with Open champion Henrik Stenson. The Swedish winner at Royal Troon last year agrees there was a responsibility on the biggest names to turn up to honour Palmer. ""Absolutely, you can definitely argue for that,"" he said. ""There's going to be some special tributes to his life. We're putting some umbrellas [Palmer's trademark] on our bags and things like that. So I'm sure it's going to be a great week, and we're going to do our best to honour him."" Former Open winner Louis Oosthuizen went further. ""I just think it's a tournament that, if you can, you should play it every year,"" he said. ""And I'm going to try to do that from now on."" But it is never that straightforward, especially with the overly congested nature of the PGA Tour's schedule in the build-up to next month's first major, the Masters. Jason Day, winner of the 2016 Arnold Palmer Invitational - players will have pins of Palmer's trademark umbrella on their bags this week As Rickie Fowler, another top 10 star playing at Bay Hill this week, commented: ""The biggest thing is you want to make sure you're ready to go at Augusta."" This is why Stenson and his Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose are skipping next week's WGC Matchplay, a tournament for the world's top 64 players and worth $9.75m prize money. Rose does not like the idea of playing head-to-head matchplay so close to the Masters but the wider point is that shoehorning in two elite World Golf Championships before Augusta creates tough scheduling choices. First-world problems they may be, but the current set-up is a mess that made it harder for leading players to honour Palmer this week. The traditional Florida swing was interrupted by this month's WGC in Mexico City and next week matchplay is introduced when players want to hone scoring skills for their tilts at gaining a Green Jacket. It is clear the schedule needs shaking up, especially if plans to move back the Players Championship to March come to fruition. The idea under consideration is to shift the tournament, known as the fifth major, so that an actual major, the US PGA Championship, can move from August to a date in May. This, in turn, would allow the late summer PGA Tour play-offs an earlier start, with the FedEx Cup being completed before the start of the American football season. Currently the cash-rich season-ender goes unnoticed in the US because of the sporting behemoth that is the NFL. These are radical and fascinating schedule proposals under active consideration. Each of the events concerned carries vast prize funds and every stakeholder inevitably wants a slice of maximised exposure. This is foremost in the minds of Tour bosses - but for this week, at least, they will be better served remembering the man who did most to make possible such multi-million dollar chatter.

"Two important questions arise from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement that she will seek a second independence referendum. First, do voters in Scotland want a second referendum? And second, how might they vote if an independence referendum were to be held any time soon? During recent months, a number of polls have asked people in a variety of different ways whether there should be a second independence referendum within the next couple of years. They have all obtained much the same answer. Around a half say there should not be, while between a third and two-fifths say there should. Indyref2: Your questions answered Most recently, for example, a poll conducted by BMG Research published in Monday's Herald newspaper found that 39% believe that another referendum should be held prior to the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, while 49% are opposed to the idea. People's opinions on the subject tend to depend on their views on the merits of independence in the first place. Around four in five of those who want Scotland to remain part of the UK oppose having a second referendum within the next couple of years, while around two-thirds of those who back independence would like a ballot to be held soon. It is the apparent lack of enthusiasm for a second referendum amongst some supporters that is the main reason why opponents of an early second ballot are apparently in the majority. But that does not mean that most voters think that another ballot should not be held for ""another generation"". Polling conducted by Panelbase for The Sunday Times has found that half of voters either think a referendum should be held during the Brexit negotiations (as the first minister appears to have in mind) or that one should be held once the negotiations have been concluded (that is, just a little later than Ms Sturgeon's proposed timetable). They counterbalance exactly the other half of Scotland which says that a poll should not be held at any point within the next few years. So this polling suggests that Scotland is evenly divided on the principle of having a relatively early second ballot. In short, both sides in the debate about whether a second referendum should be held can find polling evidence that seemingly bolsters their case. In the first independence referendum held in September 2014, 55% of Scots voted to stay in the UK, while 45% supported independence. But how might Scotland vote a second time around? To date, five polls have been conducted since in mid-January Prime Minister Theresa May outlined her vision of the kind of Brexit deal that the UK should seek in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU. Once those who said 'Don't Know' are put to one side, these polls have on average reported that 48% say they would vote 'Yes' to independence, while 52% say they would vote 'No'. So the two sides look as though they are more evenly matched than they eventually proved to be two and a half years ago. Still, Ms Sturgeon is seemingly taking a big gamble in calling for a second independence referendum. It is far from certain that she will win. But equally Mrs May cannot presume that the first minister is bound to lose. Expect an intense and strongly-fought battle if Scotland does indeed go to the polls once again any time soon.

"Whose round is it anyway? Coffee drinking could be overtaking the office tea round as workers search for a caffeine jolt, but the hunt for a clean tea mug still continues in many offices. Freelance journalist Caroline Bullock explores the politics and psychology of the tea round. According to research, when it comes to countering the afternoon energy slump, office workers are switching off the office kettle and opting for High Street coffee. It seems the baristas have raised the bar and our expectations, rendering the cracked mugs and amateur efforts from colleagues increasingly redundant. Yet beyond an improved taste and greater dent in the wallet, it's a move with broader implications, notably the threat to the office tea round. While critics claim the politics and pettiness of this enduring ritual make it irrelevant in the modern workplace, for me it's a process with a purpose. For a start, office life has always involved a degree of artifice, notably the falsehood that everyone is part of one equitable and harmonious team. It's a mantra crudely reinforced in various ways: the shared corporate values, the away days and secret Santas to name a few. Scratch the surface, however, and you can find that the bonhomie is a little contrived. Interestingly, the tea round offers a much-needed reality check in exposing social hierarchies and gender bias, and shows that a good old-fashioned pecking order is still alive and well. Caroline Bullock - burned by tea round etiquette It starts with the person who never makes a drink but is always served one, a move that cements their status as someone far too important for such drudgery. Do the same, however, and you're guilty of office life's greatest felony - having ideas above your station. I speak from experience. New to a demanding role on a newspaper, I appreciated the teas that came on tap, fuelling the pithy headlines and the slog to deadline. Basking in my creative bubble, I didn't have the time or inclination to reciprocate, and figured this was fine as I was following the lead of a male colleague who never returned the favour either. Two weeks later and the team's patience had expired; the tea round took place and I was excluded. Interestingly, my partner in crime continued to enjoy a steady stream of beverages, while I was left parched and indignant with the stark message that some get away with it and others don't - draw your own conclusions. Mounds of mugs are a common sight in offices Further double standards can arise when it comes to the mess created. Soggy mounds of teabags, unwashed mugs, crusty discarded teaspoons - I'm guilty of it all, but my slovenly habits have tended to attract more comment than comparable misdemeanours from male colleagues and usually from other women. For Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester University, this seemingly simple activity reflects the many dynamics in the office around gender and status. ""It's really about the expectations colleagues have of each other and the sociological and psychological factors under the surface,"" he says. ""I still notice in many tea rounds that while men may help make the tea, it is usually the women that do the washing up, or load the dishwasher. ""If I was to observe a tea round for a month I would be able to tell who gets on best and who is the outsider, as well as the fact that a so-called 'team' is very rarely a team."" Lawyer Grace Bennett had to contend with archaic attitudes from two older gentlemen And refreshment faux pas can prevail in other professional capacities. Lawyer Grace Bennett at Vista Employer Services recalls how a recent networking event was blighted by ""dinosaur attitudes"". ""I walked towards the self-service coffee machine and a man in his 60s standing in front of it said to his male colleague, 'Great, now there's a woman here maybe we can get a cup of tea.' I ignored it and assumed he was joking but when I had my drink in my hand he said perfectly seriously: 'Is that drink for me?' ""If I'd been less confident that could have really affected me."" Should you socialise with your colleagues? Are office Christmas parties worth it? Does free food make for a happier office? Not surprisingly, where tea rounds still thrive, it seems efforts are being made to avoid potential flashpoints. A recent mandate introduced at GingerMay PR limits tea making to immediate neighbours to end niggles over time-sapping rounds. Elsewhere, the process is getting a more technological revamp. For the team at marketing agency No Brainer, a tea round app is solving brew-based arguments by letting an algorithm select whose turn it is at random. An answer to the UK's productivity puzzle? Then there's the iKettle, which is controlled remotely via a smartphone app, so you can boil it from your desk. Christian Lane, the founder of Smarter, the company behind it, says the product saves two days a year in lost productivity physically waiting in the kitchen for it to boil. Yet while these gadgets breathe new life into a traditional routine, they may struggle to compete with offices that have in-house baristas. Henry Mizel from office-space booking firm Nomad says these amenities are replacing the water cooler as the office focal point for interaction. ""The better the coffee machine, the more likely people will be to make a booking there. To remain competitive, workspaces are having to cater to all needs, including baristas, who will make you anything your heart desires,"" he says. Should you socialise with your colleagues?
