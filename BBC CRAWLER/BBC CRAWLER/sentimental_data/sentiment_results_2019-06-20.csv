"Antoinette Sandbach has been a Conservative MP for Eddisbury in Cheshire since 2015 The government's chief whip has promised to investigate messages sent to a female Conservative MP by a colleague in which she was was called a ""disgrace"" and told to quit the party. In a now-deleted tweet, Antoinette Sandbach shared a screenshot of WhatsApp messages which she said were sent to her by a male Tory MP. ""You too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think,"" they read. It comes as Conservative MPs voted for their final two leadership contenders. On Thursday, secret ballots were held which whittled down the remaining candidates to just Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt - one of whom will become the UK's next prime minister. Hunt to face Johnson in Tory leader race Kuenssberg: Johnson camp relieved at Gove exit Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Ms Sandbach, the MP for Eddisbury in Cheshire, backed Rory Stewart in the leadership campaign, beforehe was eliminatedfrom the contest on Wednesday. She has been a strong opponent of a no-deal Brexit. On Thursday, she shared the phone messages on Twitter, and said: ""Barely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin. This is from a male Conservative MP to me as I sat on the train home."" In a follow-up tweet, she added: ""It's bad enough when you get it from complete strangers. Is it any wonder three female MPs left."" Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allenleft the party in Februaryto join Change UK, citing concerns over the ""the hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" in the Conservative Party. Ms Sandbach told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she believed the message was a reference to her position on Brexit, and that it was ""unacceptable"" to tell people to leave the party because they held different views. ""Even though I may have argued for Remain in the referendum originally, I have accepted the result and supported the prime minister three times [by voting for her Brexit deal],"" she said. Meanwhile, members of the public replied with messages of support for Ms Sandbach, calling the messages ""shocking"" and ""disgusting"". The government's chief whip, Julian Smith, called it ""totally unacceptable"" and pledged to investigate. He also thanked Ms Sandbach for supporting the government's Brexit deal three times in Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police told planners no urgent security action was needed at London Bridge less than a month before deadly attacks in the area, an inquest has heard. The City of London Corporation security director said the advice came at a meeting with a counter-terror adviser in May 2017, after the bridge was put on a list of vulnerable locations. Four weeks later, three attackers killed eight people and hurt 48 others. The inquest into the victims' deaths is being held at the Old Bailey. Richard Woolford told the court London Bridge had not been one of five ""highly vulnerable"" sites flagged up as security priorities by counter-terrorism police. But he arranged to meet City of London Police's Matthew Hone after the area was flagged as a risk following a review in April 2017. He told the inquest the counter-terror adviser ""categorically"" told him ""no immediate action"" was required. Recounting what happened at the meeting, Mr Woolford said: ""I asked at that point is there any action required by me or the corporation by this and he said no."" Mr Woolford said he ""never saw"" any recommendations for ""long-term permanent solutions"" PC Hone had said he would give to him. Sgt Hone told the previous day's inquest hearing he had warned colleagues London Bridge was the ""most vulnerable location [to a] marauding vehicle attack"", along with one other unnamed area. 'Chaos' hindered London attack medic response London attacker was 60cm from armed officer London Bridge: MI5 'missed chances due to errors' Shortly after the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017, Sgt Hone - who was at that time a PC - emailed senior colleagues to say ""something needs to change"". The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden But the court heard the popular tourist spot had not met the criteria for barriers to be installed because it did not fall within the Home Office's ""rigid"" definition of a crowded place. Jane Gyford, who at the time was the City of London Police commander of operations and security, said there was also ""no intelligence"" to suggest the area would be targeted by attackers. Asked if temporary protective barriers might have been an option, she said: ""There is no case in this country where National Barrier Asset has been used without intelligence or to do with an event."" Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Gareth Patterson QC, representing some of the victims' families, said London Bridge had been ""crying out for protection"" before the attack. On Tuesday the inquest heard an independent report had identified the area as a ""viable and attractive"" target for an attack using a vehicle as a weapon. Counsel to the coroner, Jonathan Hough QC, told the inquest the study by Cerastes, which had been commissioned by City of London Police, found ""the location and layout of the bridge lends itself to a ram attack with no physical barriers in place to prevent a vehicle mounting the pavement"". The Metropolitan Police's lead for royalty and specialist protection security said she had not heard of the report until after the attack but that it would not have changed how police prioritised which areas to protect. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi added: ""I don't think the report itself would cause me to start putting protective security measures in because it could be written for a multitude of places in London."" Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba were shot dead within minutes of driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in and around Borough Market. Those killed in the attack were Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Alexandre Pigeard, 26.

"German battleships sinking off the island of Fara In waters off Orkney a century ago, 52 German warships were sunk in one day - but this huge naval loss was not inflicted by enemy forces. Instead the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow was a deliberate act of sabotage ordered by a commander who refused to let his ships become the spoils of war. It was the single greatest loss of warships in history and the nine German sailors killed that day were the last to die during World War One. The final peace treaty was signed just a week later. After the fighting in WW1 ended in November 1918, the entire German fleet was ordered to gather together in the Firth of Forth, near Edinburgh, to be ""interned"" by Allied forces. The battlecruiser Derflinger just four minutes before it disappeared beneath the surface Nine German battleships, five battlecruisers, seven light cruisers and 49 destroyers - the most modern ships of the German High Seas Fleet - were handed over to the victorious forces off the east of Scotland. Within a week, the 70 German ships were escorted to the sheltered waters of Scapa Flow, off Orkney, where they and four other vessels were held while the details of the peace talks were worked out. The day the German navy surrendered in the Forth The final decision on their fate was to be taken at Versailles, but until then German sailors were kept on board their ships in the vast natural harbour. At Versailles, the victorious powers wrangled over what to do with the ships. Britain and the US wanted them destroyed. The French and Italians thought it better to share them out between the Allies. The fleet was in Scapa Flow for seven months before it was scuttled ""The ships were not actually surrendered and that's why there were no British troops on board them to prevent them being scuttled,"" Tom Muir from Orkney Museum toldBBC Radio Scotland's When the Fleet Went Down. ""They were German government property and remained that throughout their time here."" The German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was not kept informed of what was happening outside of his ships. He had to rely on briefings from British commanders and old copies of the Times newspaper, according to Tom Muir. The peace talks had been intended to conclude on 21 June but the deadline was extended. As far as von Reuter knew the talks had failed and he was fully expecting his ships to be boarded and seized by the Royal Navy. The German admiral felt duty-bound not to let that happen. Mr Muir says: ""Von Reuter had already sent letters around the commanders of the ships telling them that he was planning to have the fleet scuttled at his signal. Ironically it was the British drifters who were carting those letters around to the officers on the other ships."" On the morning of 21 June 1919, the British fleet took advantage of good weather to steam out of the harbour on exercise. At 10:30, von Reuter's flagship, Emden, sent out the seemingly innocuous message - ""Paragraph Eleven; confirm"". It was a code ordering his men to scuttle their own ships. The day the German High Seas Fleet sank 52Warships sank to the seabed 9German sailors were killed 7months after the end of World War One 7wrecks still lie in Scapa Flow today The ""paragraph eleven"" signal, using semaphore and searchlights, took a while to reach all the ships because they were positioned right across the vast flow. ""They would have waited and like a wave it went through the ships from north to south,"" says Mr Muir. Beneath decks, German sailors began to open seacocks - valves that allow water in - and smash pipes. Mr Muir says: ""They had all been deliberately flooded from one side first so that they would turn over and sink because they believed it would make it more difficult for them to salvage them."" At first it was not clear what was happening and it took a couple of hours before it became apparent that the Germans had deliberately sunk their ships. The German sailors took to small boats to escape their sinking ships as the few remaining British sailors onboard Royal Navy drifters, small vessels about the size of fishing trawlers which often escorted destroyers, tried to work out what to do. The crew of a German destroyer abandoning ship The only civilian witnesses were schoolchildren from Stromness who were on a trip to view the German fleet onboard a water tender. One of the schoolchildren, 12-year-old Leslie Thorpe, wrote that one German boat full of fleeing soldiers did not have a white flag and the British fired on it with a machine gun. ""The one thing that should not be forgotten is men died that day,"" says Mr Muir. ""We see all these images and it is just a huge piece of metal rolling over in the sea and sinking and you forget about the cost in human terms. ""The men in the drifters were ordered to open fire on the defenceless German sailors. They had no weapons, they were not allowed them and they didn't have any."" It is believed nine Germans died as a result of the actions that day. British Boarding Party alongside a German destroyer By 17:00, most of the German High Seas Fleet had disappeared beneath the surface of Scapa Flow. The Hindenburg, the biggest German battlecruiser, was the last to sink. During the 1920s and '30s many of the 52 ships were lifted from the sea bed by commercial contractors and broken up. The seven wrecks that remain are now classed as scheduled monuments, nationally important archaeological sites given protection against unauthorised change. Earlier this week it emerged thatfour of the vessels, which are now owned by a retired diving contractor, are being sold on eBay. ""The scuttling of the German fleet removed them from being a bargaining chip in peace negotiations but it was seen as a hostile act by the British,"" says Mr Muir. ""In Germany it was seen as a way of restoring some honour. The navy had not let the ships fall into enemy hands."" A senior German officer declared at the time that this act had wiped away the ""stain of surrender"" from the German fleet.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to split from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to set up their own foundation. Prince Harry and Meghan will break away from the Royal Foundation and hope to establish a new charity by the end of the year, according to royal aides. The couples will continue to work together on initiatives such as the Heads Together mental health campaign. The foundation said the royals were ""incredibly proud"" of their joint work. Set up in 2009, the Royal Foundation focused on causes close to the princes' hearts, including the armed forces, conservation and mental health. In a statement, the charity - which will be renamed the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - said the decision was made after a review of its structure. The four royals held the first - and so far only - Royal Foundation forum together in London in 2018 ""These changes are designed to best complement the work and responsibilities of Their Royal Highnesses as they prepare for their future roles, and to better align their charitable activity with their new households,"" it added. ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are incredibly proud of what they have achieved together through the Royal Foundation,"" it said. Royals launch mental health text line Meghan to 'shine light' on women's rights Catherine joined after she became Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 and Meghan joined shortly before she and Harry were married in May 2018. The couples took to the stage together at the charity's first forum in London in February 2018. The charity's title was later officially changed to The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The move by the Sussexes is seen as the final step in the division of the couples' public duties. The royal charity said the dukes and duchesses were ""incredibly proud"" of the work they have done together The Heads Together campaign was launched in 2016 by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry to end the stigma around mental health Earlier this year the duke and duchess split from the household of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate live with their children.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face Boris Johnson in the run-off to become Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Jeremy Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. He became the MP for South West Surrey at the 2005 general election, taking over from Virginia Bottomley. From 2005 to 2007, Mr Hunt was shadow minister for disabled people. It was a reward for supporting David Cameron, who attended Oxford University at the same time as him, in the Conservative leadership election.  2018-presentForeign secretary 2012-2018Health secretary 2010-2012Culture secretary 2007-2010Shadow culture secretary 2005-2007Shadow minister for disabled people A reshuffle in 2007 saw Mr Hunt promoted to shadow culture secretary. In 2009, he was found to havebreached expenses rules and ordered to repay more than Â£9,500,external. He had allowed his agent to stay rent-free in his constituency property, which was designated as his second home. Mr Hunt had claimed Â£19,117 in public money towards the property, but it was decided he hadn't benefited financially from the situation. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed in 2010, Jeremy Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport. Olympics It was a key role in the run-up to London's 2012 Olympics and he worked closely with then London Mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr Hunt campaigned on the importance of tourism during the Olympics. And he took the decision to double the budget for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies from Â£40m to Â£81m. The Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a big success. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt's bell-ringing clanger Mr Hunt also put emphasis on creating a lasting legacy for the games. The government gave Sport England Â£1bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Mr Hunt said there was an ""extraordinary chance"" to ""reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old"". But in the years that followed there wasonly a small increase in the number of young people taking up sport. In 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%. BSkyB takeover Earlier in 2012, his career was hanging in the balance. During the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, his contact with the Murdoch family came under scrutiny. Mr Hunt was responsible for overseeing the proposed takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. He was criticised for failing to supervise his adviser's contact with News Corp, and for messages he exchanged with James Murdoch on the bid. His special adviser, Adam Smith, was forced to quit. The inquiry released texts sent from Mr Hunt to News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel when it was bidding for BSkyB. The culture secretary addressed him as ""Daddy"" and ""mon ami"" - their wives had given birth in the same hospital in May 2010. Separately, in December 2010, he told Mr Michel there was ""nothing u won't like"" in a forthcoming speech. Mr Hunt insisted he acted with ""total integrity"" during the bid process. Local television As culture secretary, Mr Hunt also led a government plan to launch local television stations across the UK. More than 30 had been set up beforeOfcom later scrapped,externalthe roll-out of any further channels, because of limited interest from viewers and financial difficulties. City TV, the holder of the local TV licence for Birmingham, was forced to appoint administrators to find a buyer before it was even launched, for example. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt Reality Check: What is 'no-deal Brexit'? BBC Mr Hunt also announced a deal with the BBC to freeze the licence fee for six years at Â£145.50 from 2010. He said high executive salaries and an advantage over commercial broadcasters were a cause for concern. That was equivalent to a 16% budget cut in real terms and led to the BBC having to make savings, including 2,000 job losses. Under the agreement, the BBC also took on responsibility for funding the World Service, the Welsh language channel S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas. Was mayor of London for eight years, overseeing the London 2012 Olympics Resigned as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit strategy Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Boris Johnson's track record? Jeremy Hunt was appointed health secretary in September 2012, with Maria Miller taking on his previous role. He would eventually become the longest-serving health secretary in NHS history, surpassing its founder, Labour's Aneurin Bevan. NHS funding But Mr Hunt held office during the slowest period of investment in the NHS since its foundation - which created big problems. Since the NHS was established, health spending has risen by about 4% above inflation each year on average. Post-2010, as the coalition budget tried to reduce the deficit, this fell to about 1% a year. This came as demands on the health service were growing. Between 2005 and 2015, A&E visits went up by almost 30%. And during Mr Hunt's tenure as health secretary, the number of people in the population aged 85 and over went up by about a third. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said funding for the NHS needed to rise by 4.3% a year just to keep up with rising demand, without actively improving standards. Financial difficulties led to more hospitals going into the red, as well as targets being missed in three main areas: cancer care, hospital appointments and A&E waiting times. NHS England has not met any of these targets since 2015. Just 85.3% of patients were seen at A&E departments within the waiting time target of four hours in January 2018. At least 95% of patients attending A&E are supposed to be either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Unions, like the GMB, demanded his resignation. Junior doctors battle As well as a series of austerity measures - which included extending a cap on pay increases for NHS staff - he was also criticised for his handling of the junior doctor contract row. Mr Hunt said that changes to contracts were essential to deliver a seven-day NHS in England by 2020 - a pledge in the Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto. To achieve this, the proposed contracts would mean evenings and Saturdays would be considered ""normal"" rather than ""unsocial"" hours and would no longer attract overtime pay. The NHS's pay review body had said the cost of paying a premium on these ""unsocial hours"" put delivering a seven-day NHS out of reach. Reality Check: How much has social care been cut? Junior doctors responded by tweeting pictures of themselves working weekend and late shifts, with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. Contract negotiations with junior doctors stopped and started and the British Medical Association eventually decided on industrial action. Junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts in 2016. On two strike days, between 08:00 and 17:00 even emergency care wasn't covered - the first time that had ever happened in the history of the NHS. Public support for the strike was high, and even after doctors withdrew emergency care, the majority of the public (57%) still supported the strike and believed the government was more at fault (54%). A newcontract for junior doctors was later imposed, after BMA members rejected a deal agreed by the government and union negotiators. Despite heavy criticism, Mr Hunt did go on to secure a funding increase for the NHS, totalling Â£20.5bn in real terms by 2023. He also oversaw the introduction of an Ofsted-style system for rating hospitals and GP surgeries in England, ranking them on things like cancer, mental health and diabetes services. Patient safety Mr Hunt repeatedly referred in speeches to cases where individuals had received bad treatment in the NHS. He said he was horrified at the report into theStafford Hospital scandal. He went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers. Social care Social care was added to his brief in 2018. He spoke of the need to integrate social care, funded by local councils, with services delivered by the NHS. He had already overseen a transfer of money from the NHS to council budgets from 2014. This shared budget was designed to tackle the problem of elderly people having to stay in hospital beds unnecessarily, because of a lack of care for them at home. After this, the number of these cases fell. He also oversaw the introduction of the first national waiting-time target for mental health treatment. From April 2016, the NHS said at least 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis should begin treatment within two weeks of referral. Mr Hunt became foreign secretary in July 2018, after his predecessor and now leadership rival, Boris Johnson, quit over Theresa May's Brexit strategy. In March, he becamethe first Western foreign minister to visit Yemen since conflict there began,external. He has faced criticism for allowing the UK to sell arms to the Saudi regime, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. But he has previously defended UK-Saudi ties, saying Saudi Arabia is a ""very, very important military ally to the UK"". His time as foreign secretary has not been gaffe-free. During a meeting on an official visit to China, he called his wife Lucia Guo ""Japanese"" - although she was born in Xian in central China. This video can not be played The foreign secretary tells Today he would include the DUP and ERG in Brexit talks A Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since said he would vote Leave in a second vote. He said this was because of the ""arrogance of the European Commission"" in Brexit negotiations. He also likened the Brexit negotiating tactics of the EU to the Soviet Union. The comparison provoked criticism from EU ambassadors and politicians and there were calls for an apology. Mr Hunt says he want to negotiate a ""credible"" Brexit plan by securing changes tothe controversial Irish backstop. However, he does not rule out leaving the EU without a deal if such an outcome becomes ""the only way to deliver Brexit"". But unlike his leadership rival, Boris Johnson, he says the current departure date of 31 October is not a hard deadline.

"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018. Mr Johnson has continued to insist that the UK can and should leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal.

"Liam Fox is very relieved. The international trade secretary said he couldn't possibly contemplate two former journalists in the final. After voting for Jeremy Hunt, he told some of us gathered outside the parliamentary polling booth that it was the party's job to ""provide good governance - not entertainment"". Privately, Team Hunt successfully urged Conservative MPs to avoid a ""psychodrama"" as the final two compete for the votes of Conservative members. The Gove team failed to persuade enough MPs to put two veterans of Vote Leave in the final. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have history. Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race Gove and Johnson: What happened in 2016? Apparently best buddies during the EU referendum campaign, the relationship soured in the subsequent leadership contest in 2016. Mr Gove knifed Mr Johnson in the front when he abandoned the latter's campaign and launched his own. There were suggestions that team Boris saw Mr Hunt as an easier candidate to beat and that some of his supporters lent votes to the current foreign secretary to help him see off Mr Gove's ambitions. A key Johnson aide denied this - but said he couldn't speak for others. And with Mr Johnson's own vote going up and demonstrating momentum, it's a difficult charge to prove. So there is only one Leaver in the contest. But Mr Hunt will portray himself as a born-again Brexiteer, who would contemplate no deal - and, as an apparently more competent minister, someone who also has more chance of delivering a deal. The candidates' differences on Brexit seem in truth minuscule, each professing they want a deal that bins the backstop, or time limits it, despite likely opposition from Brussels. Mr Johnson says it's ""feasible"" to leave on 31 October, while Mr Hunt is prepared to take a little longer if a deal seems close. Quick Q&A: Brexit plans Tory leadership: Compare the candidates running for PM Beyond Brexit, Mr Hunt will suggest that he is a champion of the least well-off, the better to contrast with Mr Johnson's ambition to take more people out of the higher tax band. He will be willing to admit past mistakes and pledge to put them right, for example, suggesting that social care has been underfunded. And he will point to prominent Remainers and Brexiteers on his team to suggest he can bring the party and country back together. But Mr Johnson has two clear advantages with the members. First, he will cite polling to say only he has the chance of beating Labour if there is an early election. a distinct possibility for a leader of a minority government. Second, he has the ability to make the party feel good about itself. He paints a big picture in vivid primary colours. Mr Hunt has survived running the big-spending frontline Department of Health and Social Care but he may need to display more inspiration than perspiration as the contest moves to the country and the two candidates go head to head in 16 hustings. Mr Johnson certainly has plenty of political opponents but often his worst enemy is himself. Mr Hunt will be hoping his gaffe prone competitor will lose the plot and then lose the contest. But so far Mr Johnson has reined in his characteristic eloquence, and exercised a quality many had thought would always elude him: discipline. The stakes are high - the prize is the premiership, not just the Conservative leadership - so it would be surprising if the forthcoming contest didn't throw up heat as well as light.

"This video can not be played Iran ""made a very big mistake"" - Trump Iran ""made a very big mistake"" in shooting down a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump says. However, he told reporters it could have been the result of human error, saying: ""I find it hard to believe it was intentional."" Iran said the drone had violated Iranian airspace, but the US military denied this. The incident comes amid escalating tension between the two countries. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran would take its complaint that the US ""encroaches on our territory"" to the UN. What we know about Gulf tanker attacks The Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iran's UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said the drone was engaged in a clear spying operation in what he called a blatant violation of international law. In a letter to the UN secretary-general and the Security Council, Mr Ravanchi said that while Iran was not seeking war, it reserved the right to to defend its territory against hostile acts. Speaking at the White House, he called the drone's downing a ""new fly in the ointment"". Mr Trump said it was ""documented"" that the unmanned drone had been over international waters and not in Iranian airspace. ""I think probably Iran made a mistake - I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,"" he said. ""It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid,"" he added. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned that war between the US and Iran would be a ""catastrophe with unpredictable consequences"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. In the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a ""self-inflicted disaster"". The top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said:  ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we're worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war."" The Republicans' leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, called for a ""measured response"" to the incident. Meanwhile Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC his country was trying to send a message to Iran that its behaviour was ""not acceptable"". ""Nobody wants to start a war. But we can't let Iran go on a rampage like this. The evidence of Iranian involvement is very compelling. They said they would do it, and now they are doing it,"" he said. Oil prices have jumped by about 5% following the incident. United Airlines has suspended its Newark to Mumbai flights, which pass through Iranian airspace, after ""a thorough safety and security review"". Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours,externalafter the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech on Iranian state TV, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". Foreign minister Javad Zarif later said Iran had retrieved sections of the US military drone ""in our territorial waters where it was shot down"". He added that the aircraft had taken off from the UAE in ""stealth mode"". Iran released unverified footage of what it said was the US drone being destroyed. Allow Twitter content?

The US military's Central Command confirmed that a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at approximately 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Lt Gen Joseph Guastella, Commander of US Air Forces Central Command, later said the drone had been operating at high altitude and was about 34km from the nearest point on the Iranian coast when it was shot down. US naval assets have been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters, a US source told Reuters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. President Trump's comments suggesting that the Iranians' shooting down of an unmanned US aircraft over the Gulf was possibly a mistake tends to confirm earlier reports from Washington that the White House was eager to dial down tensions. The Iranians had already attempted to shoot down a smaller US drone earlier in the week, and the two episodes are a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation, with US and Iranian forces operating in close proximity. The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps had earlier characterised the incident as a clear warning to Washington. Mr Trump appears to be holding out the possibility that not everyone in Tehran is following the same playbook, perhaps leaving space for more moderate voices there similarly to reduce the tension. On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen gets close access to stricken oil tanker It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. On Monday Iran also announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year. Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone,externalwith a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement. This video can not be played Adel al-Jubeir: Iran's behaviour ""not acceptable and must stop"" The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June:Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz.

"This video can not be played Riot police blocked crowds storming Georgia's parliament Some 240 people were hurt in clashes as protesters tried to storm Georgia's parliament after a Russian MP took the speaker's seat in parliament. Riot police stopped them from entering the building, reportedly using tear gas and rubber bullets. Anger erupted when Sergei Gavrilov addressed an assembly of MPs from Orthodox Christian countries. Tensions with Russia are high, 11 years after they fought a war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Georgians protests against TV station closure Thousands protest in Georgia over gay rights rally More than 100 people were still being treated in hospital hours after the clashes on Friday, Georgian officials said.  Among the 240 hurt, 80 were police, they added. A doctor told Georgian media that two people had lost an eye. Parliament Speaker Irakli Kobakhidze announced his resignation on Friday - one of the protesters' demands. Policemen attempt to block protesters during a rally against the visit of the Russian delegation People rally outside the parliament in Tbilisi Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili condemned Mr Gavrilov's action as a ""major crime"" and appealed for calm. Mr Gavrilov blamed the clashes on ""fake news"" in which he had been wrongly accused of fighting against Georgia in the early 1990s. Russia's foreign ministry accused Georgia's opposition of trying to prevent an improvement in relations. Mr Gavrilov was taking part in the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy (IAO), a body set up by the Greek parliament in 1993 to foster relationships between Christian Orthodox lawmakers. Opposition MPs in Georgia's parliament called for protests in response to his decision to deliver a speech from the speaker's seat. He addressed delegates in Russian, angering politicians and Georgians vehemently opposed to Moscow's presence in the country. Calling for the Speaker and other officials to resign, about 10,000 protesters breached the police cordon in the capital, Tbilisi. Some were carrying EU flags and placards reading ""Russia is an occupier"". Giga Bokeria, an opposition MP for the European Georgia party, told AFP the rally outside parliament had been ""a spontaneous protest by ordinary Georgians"". An opposition MP described the rally as ""a spontaneous protest by ordinary Georgians"" Inside parliament, opposition lawmakers blocked the presidium and demanded that the parliamentary speaker, interior minister and state security service chief all resign over the incident. The session was suspended and Mr Gavrilov has reportedly left the country. ""That was a slap in the face of recent Georgian history,"" Elene Khoshtaria, an opposition member of parliament, said. Mr Gavrilov later said he had left the building under guard, blaming the clashes on fake reports that he had taken part in wars in Abkhazia and Trans-Dniester. He had ""never taken part in any military conflicts"", he insisted. Analysis by BBC News' Rayhan Demytrie in Tbilisi The protest continues outside parliament building in Tbilisi in spite of repeated use of tear gas by the police. Several protesters have been injured, I saw one man with a bleeding mouth who said that he was standing close to parliament entrance and was hit by a rubber bullets. Riot police gear such as plastic shields and helmets were seized by some protesters and passed through the crowd. Policemen detain a man during a protest against the visit of the Russian delegation in Tbilisi Protesters clash with a policeman during mass a demonstration outside Georgia's parliament This demonstration gathered spontaneously in response to calls from the Georgian opposition to protest against what many Georgians say was an outrageous act - to see an MP from an ""occupying"" country entering their parliament. Anti-Russian sentiment is strong in Georgia which fought a war with Russia over its breakaway region of South Ossetia in 2008. South Ossetia and another breakaway region of Abkhazia are supported by Russia both financially and militarily. When Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, separatist conflicts erupted in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In August 2008, Georgia attempted to recapture South Ossetia, which it had fought a separatist war against in the 1990s. Russia poured troops in, ousting Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following a ceasefire, Russia withdrew most of its troops from undisputed parts of Georgia but still maintains a military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, recognising both as ""independent"" states. Since then, diplomatic relations between Russia and Georgia have been severed. To the ire of Moscow, Georgia has ambitions to join the European Union and Nato.

"The review follows criticism of a televised debate between contenders in the Tory leadership contest The BBC is to review whether ""additional steps"" should be taken when vetting guests for political debates. The broadcaster was criticised over those given a chance to ask questions during its televised debate between candidates in the Tory leadership race. It emerged that one guest had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets - he was later suspended from his job. A BBC spokeswoman said ""vetting and transparency"" of guests for political programmes would be reviewed. ""We have a long history of producing successful debate programmes and this was no different,"" she said. She said it would be ""odd"" to have members of the public as contributors who all agreed ""with the politics of those they are questioning"". ""We did however, adopt a different format for this programme and we will look at whether there are additional steps we might take on vetting and transparency should we repeat it in the future,"" she added. BBC 'debate bias' and leadership race latest Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race On Wednesdaythe broadcaster defended its vetting processafter tweets by Imam Abdullah Patel came to light. The BBC said Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's programme, Our Next Prime Minister. The tweets had not been visible to its researchers before then, the BBC said. A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014posted on the Guido Fawkes website,externalshowed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarilysuspended from her partythree years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook. Mr Patel would not have been selected for the programme if it had been ""aware of the views he expressed"", the broadcaster said. This video can not be played Abdullah Patel asked the Tory leadership candidates if they agreed that ""words had consequences"" Mr Patel, who asked the leadership candidates about the Islamophobic rhetoric faced by members of the Muslim community, was later suspended as deputy head of a girls' school. Al-Ashraf primary school in Gloucester said it was investigating the allegations against Mr Patel. Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire on Wednesday, he said had not criticised the Jewish community, but stood by criticism of Israeli policy. Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. In response the BBC said the questioners ""held a range of political views and we did not specify these views nor their backgrounds although some chose to do so themselves.

"Liam Fox is very relieved. The international trade secretary said he couldn't possibly contemplate two former journalists in the final. After voting for Jeremy Hunt, he told some of us gathered outside the parliamentary polling booth that it was the party's job to ""provide good governance - not entertainment"". Privately, Team Hunt successfully urged Conservative MPs to avoid a ""psychodrama"" as the final two compete for the votes of Conservative members. The Gove team failed to persuade enough MPs to put two veterans of Vote Leave in the final. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have history. Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race Gove and Johnson: What happened in 2016? Apparently best buddies during the EU referendum campaign, the relationship soured in the subsequent leadership contest in 2016. Mr Gove knifed Mr Johnson in the front when he abandoned the latter's campaign and launched his own. There were suggestions that team Boris saw Mr Hunt as an easier candidate to beat and that some of his supporters lent votes to the current foreign secretary to help him see off Mr Gove's ambitions. A key Johnson aide denied this - but said he couldn't speak for others. And with Mr Johnson's own vote going up and demonstrating momentum, it's a difficult charge to prove. So there is only one Leaver in the contest. But Mr Hunt will portray himself as a born-again Brexiteer, who would contemplate no deal - and, as an apparently more competent minister, someone who also has more chance of delivering a deal. The candidates' differences on Brexit seem in truth minuscule, each professing they want a deal that bins the backstop, or time limits it, despite likely opposition from Brussels. Mr Johnson says it's ""feasible"" to leave on 31 October, while Mr Hunt is prepared to take a little longer if a deal seems close. Quick Q&A: Brexit plans Tory leadership: Compare the candidates running for PM Beyond Brexit, Mr Hunt will suggest that he is a champion of the least well-off, the better to contrast with Mr Johnson's ambition to take more people out of the higher tax band. He will be willing to admit past mistakes and pledge to put them right, for example, suggesting that social care has been underfunded. And he will point to prominent Remainers and Brexiteers on his team to suggest he can bring the party and country back together. But Mr Johnson has two clear advantages with the members. First, he will cite polling to say only he has the chance of beating Labour if there is an early election. a distinct possibility for a leader of a minority government. Second, he has the ability to make the party feel good about itself. He paints a big picture in vivid primary colours. Mr Hunt has survived running the big-spending frontline Department of Health and Social Care but he may need to display more inspiration than perspiration as the contest moves to the country and the two candidates go head to head in 16 hustings. Mr Johnson certainly has plenty of political opponents but often his worst enemy is himself. Mr Hunt will be hoping his gaffe prone competitor will lose the plot and then lose the contest. But so far Mr Johnson has reined in his characteristic eloquence, and exercised a quality many had thought would always elude him: discipline. The stakes are high - the prize is the premiership, not just the Conservative leadership - so it would be surprising if the forthcoming contest didn't throw up heat as well as light.

"This video can not be played The suspects were named at a media conference A day after the MH17 plane crash inquiry team announced murder charges against four men, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has condemned the decision as ""ridiculous"". The three Russians and a Ukrainian are accused of bringing a missile into eastern Ukraine which shot the Malaysian Airlines plane down. All 298 people on board were killed. ""From the very beginning it became a political issue on how to accuse Russia of wrongdoing,"" Mr Mahathir said. Four charged with murder for downing flight MH17 Russian President Vladimir Putin also rejected the findings on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, Malaysia is itself part of the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), which has been working on the criminal inquiry for years.A foreign ministry statement said it remained committed to the inquiry process,external. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte criticised the Malaysian leader's remarks and said the foreign ministry in The Hague was in touch with its counterparts in Kuala Lumpur. ""I can imagine the relatives will be naturally very disappointed by it and it also causes confusion,"" he told reporters. The three Russians charged were all closely connected to Russian intelligence services, prosecutors said, and all four were involved in the conflict with the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine at the time the plane was shot down on 17 July 2014. A trial will open in the Netherlands on 9 March 2020, even if the suspects are not present. Igor Girkin (also known as Strelkov) is, prosecutors say, a former colonel in Russia's FSB intelligence service who had the role of minister of defence in the rebel-held eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He has denied involvement Sergei Dubinsky (known as Khmury), was employed by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and was a deputy of Mr Girkin who was in regular contact with Russia, prosecutors say Oleg Pulatov, known as Giurza, was - according to the JIT - a former soldier of GRU special forces and deputy head of the intelligence service in Donetsk Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko commanded a rebel combat unit in eastern Ukraine, according to prosecutors Russia has insisted that there is no concrete evidence to back up allegations that the missile came from its territory or that Russian officials have been involved in the separatist campaign against Ukrainian forces. But investigators have already produced evidence that they say proves the Buk anti-aircraft missile that brought down MH17 was transported to eastern Ukraine from the 53rd Russian military brigade based in Kursk. Investigators say this conversation proves a top Kremlin official was involved in discussing military support for rebels in Donetsk During Wednesday's JIT news conference, investigators also produced wiretapped audio of a phone-call six days before the crash. The call features Vladislav Surkov, a top aide to President Putin, discussing Russian military assistance with the ex-head of the rebel Donetsk republic, Alexander Borodai. A separate, earlier wiretap, investigators say, featured Igor Girkin appealing for anti-aircraft defence material from Sergei Aksenov, Russia's leader in recently annexed Crimea. Investigators say they want to know who was involved in the decision-making process in Russia, particularly who decided a Buk missile launcher would be sent to Ukraine and who would crew it. A Russian military expert told Tass news agency that when hostilities ""were in full swing"", Vladislav Surkov never spoke by phone with separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine for security reasons. The 93-year-old Malaysian leader went on to demand proof of Russian guilt, insisting ""so far, there is no proof, only hearsay"". When asked if his reaction had anything to do with sales of Malaysian palm oil, he said no. Palm oil is key to Malaysia's economy, for jobs and exports. But earlier this year the European Commission recommended the phasing out of palm oil for use in biofuels for transport by 2030, deciding that palm oil production caused excessive deforestation. Malaysia has since announced it is keen to trade its palm oil in return for military equipment such as fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made fleet. Malaysian reports have recently quoted Russian officials as offering to increase palm oil purchases in return for a military deal.

"Slack founder Stewart Butterfield takes a selfie outside the New York Stock Exchange as the firm's shares begin trading Shares in messaging app Slack surged 49% as the company became the latest tech start-up to join the stock market. Slack set a guide price of $26 a share, but rose 60% at the start of trading before easing back to finish at $39. The company chose a direct listing on the stock market, rejecting the use of traditional advisers and underwriters who manage the price of new stocks. That opened the possibility of wild swings in the price as traders try to assess where the shares might settle. The jump in the share price put the value of the company at $25bn. Slack is the second big tech firm to go the direct route, after music streaming service Spotify used the method last year. Valued at billions but making no profit? How to cope with email overload ""We think the jury is out on whether this is the right move or not,"" Kathleen Smith, a listing expert at Renaissance Capital, said ahead of the start of trading. ""Looking at Spotify, it takes a little time for the stock to get established after a direct listing."" Slack's listing fees are expected to be about $22m. When Snap went public in 2017, it paid about $85m to its financial advisers. Spotify's listing is generally regarded as a success, although the shares now trade about 15% below their debut price. If Slack can also make a success of its direct listing, it could have implications for how future tech firms come to market, including for Airbnb. Slack's software replaces emails by grouping messages around subjects, projects and teams. It means that flooding people with irrelevant emails can be cut. The software has become increasingly popular, with HSBC and Ford among some of the big corporate users. It has about 100,000 paying customers. Founder Steward Butterfield, who developed the photo app Flickr, says Slack is a revolution in corporate communication. But like many big tech firms coming to market, Slack has never made a profit. Although revenue rose 80% to $400m in 2018, losses were $144m. And some analysts are worried that Slack is competing in an increasingly crowded market. Microsoft offers Teams, a free chat app add-on for its Office365 users. Slack's debut follows a spate of much-anticipated technology listings, some of which, including Uber Technologies and Lyft, had disappointing starts to trading.

"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave Facebook's proposed digital currency Libra a cautious welcome in a major speech on Thursday. He said it could substantially lower costs and increase financial inclusion, but needs regulation. Mr Carney also announced that non-banks will be able to hold Bank of England accounts. And he highlighted climate and sustainability concerns. Mark Carney has given a swift and positive reaction to Facebook's plan, unveiled just last week, and one that will no doubt please Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the Libra members. However, while Mr Carney said he has an open mind, he is not offering an open door. Unlike social media, where regulation is struggling to catch up after its mass adoption by billions of users, Mr Carney promised to make sure regulation to protect against risks including data privacy and money laundering is ready in advance. Libra is intended to be a currency that can be transferred via social media with its value based on a basket of real life currencies rather than the so-called crypto currencies whose value is not linked to existing exchange rates. Libra, said Mr Carney, could be systemically important - and will be regulated accordingly. The Libra Association said it was ""committed to fostering a secure network"" with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud programmes. It added that the association would not hold personal data. This is a significant speech in many ways and may be looked back on as the time the fusty old bank of England really donned its digital trousers. Less headline-grabbing than Facebook but arguably more important was the announcement that the Bank of England will allow non-banks to have an account with them. All the commercial banks we as customers bank with have their own account at the Bank of England where they store their reserves. Allowing non-banks - for example payment companies like Square and Worldpay - to have their own account could make payments faster, cheaper, more reliable and more available to people outside the traditional banking system. When I asked Bank officials what the existing High Street banks thought of this - there were some wry smiles - one said ""I'm sure they will have a point of view and will want to express it"". The Bank will also lay some of the groundwork for an open platform for small business financing, Mr Carney said. The governor said the most important future risk was that posed by climate change. This is a favourite subject of his and the Bank of England will be among the first regulators in the world to include the cost of future climate change (floods, droughts, crop failures, property damage) when it assesses whether financial institutions are strong enough to survive a crisis. Mark Carney has just over six months left in the job. With this speech he laid out a way to future proof the financial system he has overseen for nearly a decade.

"Final two candidates - Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt - go to a vote of Conservative Party members Environment Secretary Michael Gove knocked out of contest Mr Johnson got the support of more than 50% of Conservative MPs Home Secretary Sajid Javid was eliminated in another ballot, earlier on Thursday Paul Seddon and Katie Wright We take a look at the two Conservative MPs going head-to-head to become the next prime minister. There is intense national rivalry over the successors to Jean-Claude Juncker and other key figures. As Friday's newspaper front pages begin to be released, here is how some have covered the result of today's leadership ballots. This video can not be played 'Underdog' Hunt to 'prove people wrong' Jeremy Hunt says he is confident of winning the Tory Party leadership and succeeding Theresa May as prime minister ""As well as a sensible debate on Brexit, the country and the party want to hear about our vision beyond Brexit,"" he says. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Now, there's no doubt that Boris Johnson is, at this stage (and there's a long way to go), widely expected to end up in Number 10. But this result is an enormous relief to his camp, for the simple reason that they think Jeremy Hunt is easier to beat. Forget any differences in style between the two challengers and their comparative talents - Mr Hunt voted Remain in the EU referendum. And for many Tory members it is a priority for the next leader to have been committed to that cause, rather than a recent convert, however zealous. Of course, pay attention to recent political history. Upsets are the norm. Outsiders become insiders. Strange things happen, and that's before you price in Mr Johnson's ability to cause havoc for himself. But this result has left Mr Johnson's camp hugely relieved. Read more from Laura Jeremy Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Mr Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. Take a closer look at his recordhere The frontrunner in the race to be Conservative leader and prime minister, Boris Johnson, is one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. But that high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy.

Jeremy Hunt has been speaking to reporters on camera after the result, again acknowledging his status as underdog but adding: ""I like to prove people wrong"". He says the way he will win the members' ballot is by persuading them that the best way to deliver Brexit is by choosing a prime minister the EU ""will engage with"", but who is also ""prepared to walk away"". Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson will take part in a series of hustings in front of Conservative members around the country ahead of a vote to decide who is the next Tory leader and PM. The Conservative Party says there have been 20,000 applications for places at the 16 members' hustings. Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: ""I'm delighted with the strong interest in our hustings to date, showing the vitality of our party in every nation and region of the UK. ""We are conscious that the Conservatives are not just selecting a new leader but also the next prime minister, and we take that responsibility extremely seriously at such an important time for our nation."" Who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker at the Berlaymont? As one top job takes a step towards being filled, over in Brussels EU leaders are currently discussing who should be their candidate to fill another - the next president of the European Commission. The person replacing current incumbent Jean-Claude Juncker will take office in early November. They will play an important role in the future shape of Brexit regardless of what happens next, whether in managing the impact of a no-deal or overseeing future trade talks. Among those in the frame to be put forward is German MEP Manfred Weber - who once called for Boris Johnsonto be fired,externalback when he was the UK's foreign secretary. Other potential rivals include EU veteran Frans Timmermans, Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, and current EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

In 2013, the thenmayor of London opened a Wrightbus plant in Ballymena, County Antrim, where parts for them are made. Few would have bet that within six years, he would be a front-runner to become PM. Battling him for the keys to Number 10 is Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary who insists he's best placed to strengthen the union of the United Kingdom.

"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018. Mr Johnson has continued to insist that the UK can and should leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal.

"Liam Fox is very relieved. The international trade secretary said he couldn't possibly contemplate two former journalists in the final. After voting for Jeremy Hunt, he told some of us gathered outside the parliamentary polling booth that it was the party's job to ""provide good governance - not entertainment"". Privately, Team Hunt successfully urged Conservative MPs to avoid a ""psychodrama"" as the final two compete for the votes of Conservative members. The Gove team failed to persuade enough MPs to put two veterans of Vote Leave in the final. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have history. Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race Gove and Johnson: What happened in 2016? Apparently best buddies during the EU referendum campaign, the relationship soured in the subsequent leadership contest in 2016. Mr Gove knifed Mr Johnson in the front when he abandoned the latter's campaign and launched his own. There were suggestions that team Boris saw Mr Hunt as an easier candidate to beat and that some of his supporters lent votes to the current foreign secretary to help him see off Mr Gove's ambitions. A key Johnson aide denied this - but said he couldn't speak for others. And with Mr Johnson's own vote going up and demonstrating momentum, it's a difficult charge to prove. So there is only one Leaver in the contest. But Mr Hunt will portray himself as a born-again Brexiteer, who would contemplate no deal - and, as an apparently more competent minister, someone who also has more chance of delivering a deal. The candidates' differences on Brexit seem in truth minuscule, each professing they want a deal that bins the backstop, or time limits it, despite likely opposition from Brussels. Mr Johnson says it's ""feasible"" to leave on 31 October, while Mr Hunt is prepared to take a little longer if a deal seems close. Quick Q&A: Brexit plans Tory leadership: Compare the candidates running for PM Beyond Brexit, Mr Hunt will suggest that he is a champion of the least well-off, the better to contrast with Mr Johnson's ambition to take more people out of the higher tax band. He will be willing to admit past mistakes and pledge to put them right, for example, suggesting that social care has been underfunded. And he will point to prominent Remainers and Brexiteers on his team to suggest he can bring the party and country back together. But Mr Johnson has two clear advantages with the members. First, he will cite polling to say only he has the chance of beating Labour if there is an early election. a distinct possibility for a leader of a minority government. Second, he has the ability to make the party feel good about itself. He paints a big picture in vivid primary colours. Mr Hunt has survived running the big-spending frontline Department of Health and Social Care but he may need to display more inspiration than perspiration as the contest moves to the country and the two candidates go head to head in 16 hustings. Mr Johnson certainly has plenty of political opponents but often his worst enemy is himself. Mr Hunt will be hoping his gaffe prone competitor will lose the plot and then lose the contest. But so far Mr Johnson has reined in his characteristic eloquence, and exercised a quality many had thought would always elude him: discipline. The stakes are high - the prize is the premiership, not just the Conservative leadership - so it would be surprising if the forthcoming contest didn't throw up heat as well as light.

"This video can not be played The suspects were named at a media conference A day after the MH17 plane crash inquiry team announced murder charges against four men, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has condemned the decision as ""ridiculous"". The three Russians and a Ukrainian are accused of bringing a missile into eastern Ukraine which shot the Malaysian Airlines plane down. All 298 people on board were killed. ""From the very beginning it became a political issue on how to accuse Russia of wrongdoing,"" Mr Mahathir said. Four charged with murder for downing flight MH17 Russian President Vladimir Putin also rejected the findings on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, Malaysia is itself part of the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), which has been working on the criminal inquiry for years.A foreign ministry statement said it remained committed to the inquiry process,external. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte criticised the Malaysian leader's remarks and said the foreign ministry in The Hague was in touch with its counterparts in Kuala Lumpur. ""I can imagine the relatives will be naturally very disappointed by it and it also causes confusion,"" he told reporters. The three Russians charged were all closely connected to Russian intelligence services, prosecutors said, and all four were involved in the conflict with the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine at the time the plane was shot down on 17 July 2014. A trial will open in the Netherlands on 9 March 2020, even if the suspects are not present. Igor Girkin (also known as Strelkov) is, prosecutors say, a former colonel in Russia's FSB intelligence service who had the role of minister of defence in the rebel-held eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He has denied involvement Sergei Dubinsky (known as Khmury), was employed by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and was a deputy of Mr Girkin who was in regular contact with Russia, prosecutors say Oleg Pulatov, known as Giurza, was - according to the JIT - a former soldier of GRU special forces and deputy head of the intelligence service in Donetsk Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko commanded a rebel combat unit in eastern Ukraine, according to prosecutors Russia has insisted that there is no concrete evidence to back up allegations that the missile came from its territory or that Russian officials have been involved in the separatist campaign against Ukrainian forces. But investigators have already produced evidence that they say proves the Buk anti-aircraft missile that brought down MH17 was transported to eastern Ukraine from the 53rd Russian military brigade based in Kursk. Investigators say this conversation proves a top Kremlin official was involved in discussing military support for rebels in Donetsk During Wednesday's JIT news conference, investigators also produced wiretapped audio of a phone-call six days before the crash. The call features Vladislav Surkov, a top aide to President Putin, discussing Russian military assistance with the ex-head of the rebel Donetsk republic, Alexander Borodai. A separate, earlier wiretap, investigators say, featured Igor Girkin appealing for anti-aircraft defence material from Sergei Aksenov, Russia's leader in recently annexed Crimea. Investigators say they want to know who was involved in the decision-making process in Russia, particularly who decided a Buk missile launcher would be sent to Ukraine and who would crew it. A Russian military expert told Tass news agency that when hostilities ""were in full swing"", Vladislav Surkov never spoke by phone with separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine for security reasons. The 93-year-old Malaysian leader went on to demand proof of Russian guilt, insisting ""so far, there is no proof, only hearsay"". When asked if his reaction had anything to do with sales of Malaysian palm oil, he said no. Palm oil is key to Malaysia's economy, for jobs and exports. But earlier this year the European Commission recommended the phasing out of palm oil for use in biofuels for transport by 2030, deciding that palm oil production caused excessive deforestation. Malaysia has since announced it is keen to trade its palm oil in return for military equipment such as fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made fleet. Malaysian reports have recently quoted Russian officials as offering to increase palm oil purchases in return for a military deal.

"Campaign Against Arms Trade says the bombing in Yemen has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis Campaigners have won a legal challenge over the UK government's decision to allow arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which is engaged in the war in Yemen. Campaign Against Arms Trade argued the decision to continue to license military equipment for export to the Gulf state was unlawful. It said there was a clear risk the arms might be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Judges said licences should be reviewed but would not be immediately suspended. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the government would not grant any new licences for export to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners while it considers the implications of the judgment. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the government was ""disappointed"" and would be seeking permission to appeal against the judgment. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? Reality Check: What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". Giving judgment at the Court of Appeal in London, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said the government ""made no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so"". He said the government ""must reconsider the matter"" and estimate any future risks. Mr Fox said the government always took its export obligations very seriously. ""Today's judgment is not about whether the government has made the right or wrong decisions about granting export licences, but concerns the rationality of the process used to reach decisions,"" he added. The UK has licensed more than Â£4.7bn of arms exports to the Saudis since the bombing of Yemen began in March 2015. Equipment sold to Saudi Arabia includes Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, as well as precision-guided bombs. The sales contribute to thousands of engineering jobs in the UK and have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade. Campaign Against Arms Trade spokesman Andrew Smith welcomed the judgment, saying the Saudi Arabian regime was one of the most brutal and repressive in the world - yet for decades had been the largest buyer of UK-made arms. ""No matter what atrocities it has inflicted, the Saudi regime has been able to count on the uncritical political and military support of the UK,"" he said. ""The bombing has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world."" This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war Lucy Claridge, director of strategic litigation at Amnesty International, said the judgment was ""a major step towards preventing further bloodshed"". ""This is the first time that a UK court has acknowledged the risks of continuing to lavish Saudi Arabia with military equipment for use in Yemen,"" she said. Labour and the Liberal Democrats called for the government to immediately suspend all arms sales for use in the Yemen conflict. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry demanded ""a full parliamentary or public inquiry"" to find out how the breach of law was allowed to happen, and which ministers were responsible. There has been much public debate about the supply of weapons to Saudi Arabia, particularly in light of the Saudi involvement in the conflict in Yemen. Research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think tank which monitors the global weapons industry, puts Britain in second place as a supplier of ""major arms"" to Saudi Arabia, behind the United States and ahead of France. Saudi Arabia's total imports of major arms more than tripled in the period from 2012 to 2017 compared with the previous five years. This ruling is a blow to the government and to the British arms industry. More than 40% of UK arms exports are destined for Saudi Arabia. Last year alone the largest UK defence company, BAE Systems, made Â£2.6bn worth of sales to the Gulf state. While the court ruling does not necessarily mean an end to future sales, it does put them in jeopardy. The government has always insisted it has some of the world's most rigorous arms exports controls. But today's ruling shows they are not tough enough. The Court of Appeal says ministers have a legal obligation to assess allegations of serious human rights violations before allowing those sales. In the case of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen the court clearly stated the government had ""made no attempt to do so"". The government says it will appeal against the decision. But proving that UK jets and weapons have not been involved in serious human rights violations may prove difficult, given Saudi Arabia's conduct in the war. The country has been locked in a seemingly intractable civil war for four years, which has left thousands dead and pushed millions to the brink of starvation. The conflict began in 2015 when the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. The US, UK and France have provided logistical and intelligence support to the coalition and sold it weapons. The UN says at least 7,070 civilians have been killed and 11,205 injured in the conflict - 65% of the deaths are attributed to Saudi-led coalition air strikes. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. About 80% of the population - 24 million people - need humanitarian assistance and protection, and almost 10 million are just a step away from famine, says the UN. Last month, rebels pulled out of three key Red Sea ports in partial implementation of a ceasefire deal agreed last December, according to the UN. This could allow vital humanitarian aid into the country. Yemen: Why is there a war there? Arms sales aren't UK's biggest export to Saudi, so what is?

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

"The Bank of England has said it expects economic growth to be flat in the second quarter of the year. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had previously predicted growth of 0.2% over the period. The forecast came as the nine-member committee announced it had voted unanimously to keep UK interest rates on hold, at 0.75%. The committee said the downgrade in part reflected an easing of stock-building ahead of Brexit deadlines. In the run-up to the end of March, when the UK had originally been expected to leave the European Union, businesses from pharmaceuticals companies to food manufacturers stockpiled goods. They wanted to be ready in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders. The MPC said since its previous meeting, the ""near-term data have been broadly in line with the May Report, but the downside risks to growth have increased"". Global trade tensions had intensified and domestically, the ""perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit"" had risen, it added. ""As expected, recent UK data have been volatile, in large part due to Brexit-related effects on financial markets and businesses."" Brexit uncertainty 'hitting investment' 'Dramatic' fall in car output hits UK economy As a result, the committee said in its minutes that after the economy grew by 0.5% in the first three months of 2019, it now expected zero growth in the second quarter. ""That in part reflects an unwind of the positive contribution to GDP in the first quarter from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks significantly ahead of recent Brexit deadlines,"" the MPC said. The underlying pattern of relatively strong household consumption growth, but weak business investment, has persisted. In setting interest rates, the Bank is aiming to keep inflation within one percentage point either side of its target of 2% ""in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment"". On Wednesday, it was announced that inflation had fallen to its target of 2% in May, easing pressure on the Bank to raise rates to keep prices under control. And on Thursday, retail sales figures showed a retail sales fell by 0.5% between April and May, the biggest drop this year. Cold weather in May meant shoppers delayed buying summer clothes. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, said the MPC's recent warnings about possible future interest rate hikes ""look increasingly hollow, as both the ECB and Federal Reserve are now preparing to move in the opposite direction while the latest readings on the UK economy have been weak"".

"Police told planners no urgent security action was needed at London Bridge less than a month before deadly attacks in the area, an inquest has heard.

"Slack founder Stewart Butterfield takes a selfie outside the New York Stock Exchange as the firm's shares begin trading Shares in messaging app Slack surged 49% as the company became the latest tech start-up to join the stock market. Slack set a guide price of $26 a share, but rose 60% at the start of trading before easing back to finish at $39. The company chose a direct listing on the stock market, rejecting the use of traditional advisers and underwriters who manage the price of new stocks. That opened the possibility of wild swings in the price as traders try to assess where the shares might settle. The jump in the share price put the value of the company at $25bn. Slack is the second big tech firm to go the direct route, after music streaming service Spotify used the method last year. Valued at billions but making no profit? How to cope with email overload ""We think the jury is out on whether this is the right move or not,"" Kathleen Smith, a listing expert at Renaissance Capital, said ahead of the start of trading. ""Looking at Spotify, it takes a little time for the stock to get established after a direct listing."" Slack's listing fees are expected to be about $22m. When Snap went public in 2017, it paid about $85m to its financial advisers. Spotify's listing is generally regarded as a success, although the shares now trade about 15% below their debut price. If Slack can also make a success of its direct listing, it could have implications for how future tech firms come to market, including for Airbnb. Slack's software replaces emails by grouping messages around subjects, projects and teams. It means that flooding people with irrelevant emails can be cut. The software has become increasingly popular, with HSBC and Ford among some of the big corporate users. It has about 100,000 paying customers. Founder Steward Butterfield, who developed the photo app Flickr, says Slack is a revolution in corporate communication. But like many big tech firms coming to market, Slack has never made a profit. Although revenue rose 80% to $400m in 2018, losses were $144m. And some analysts are worried that Slack is competing in an increasingly crowded market. Microsoft offers Teams, a free chat app add-on for its Office365 users. Slack's debut follows a spate of much-anticipated technology listings, some of which, including Uber Technologies and Lyft, had disappointing starts to trading.

Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba were shot dead within minutes of driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in and around Borough Market.

"This video can not be played Iran ""made a very big mistake"" - Trump Iran ""made a very big mistake"" in shooting down a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump says. However, he told reporters it could have been the result of human error, saying: ""I find it hard to believe it was intentional."" Iran said the drone had violated Iranian airspace, but the US military denied this. The incident comes amid escalating tension between the two countries. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran would take its complaint that the US ""encroaches on our territory"" to the UN. What we know about Gulf tanker attacks The Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iran's UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said the drone was engaged in a clear spying operation in what he called a blatant violation of international law. In a letter to the UN secretary-general and the Security Council, Mr Ravanchi said that while Iran was not seeking war, it reserved the right to to defend its territory against hostile acts. Speaking at the White House, he called the drone's downing a ""new fly in the ointment"". Mr Trump said it was ""documented"" that the unmanned drone had been over international waters and not in Iranian airspace. ""I think probably Iran made a mistake - I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,"" he said. ""It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid,"" he added. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned that war between the US and Iran would be a ""catastrophe with unpredictable consequences"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. In the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a ""self-inflicted disaster"". The top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said:  ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we're worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war."" The Republicans' leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, called for a ""measured response"" to the incident. Meanwhile Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC his country was trying to send a message to Iran that its behaviour was ""not acceptable"". ""Nobody wants to start a war. But we can't let Iran go on a rampage like this. The evidence of Iranian involvement is very compelling. They said they would do it, and now they are doing it,"" he said. Oil prices have jumped by about 5% following the incident. United Airlines has suspended its Newark to Mumbai flights, which pass through Iranian airspace, after ""a thorough safety and security review"". Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours,externalafter the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech on Iranian state TV, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". Foreign minister Javad Zarif later said Iran had retrieved sections of the US military drone ""in our territorial waters where it was shot down"". He added that the aircraft had taken off from the UAE in ""stealth mode"". Iran released unverified footage of what it said was the US drone being destroyed. Allow Twitter content?

The US military's Central Command confirmed that a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at approximately 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Lt Gen Joseph Guastella, Commander of US Air Forces Central Command, later said the drone had been operating at high altitude and was about 34km from the nearest point on the Iranian coast when it was shot down. US naval assets have been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters, a US source told Reuters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. President Trump's comments suggesting that the Iranians' shooting down of an unmanned US aircraft over the Gulf was possibly a mistake tends to confirm earlier reports from Washington that the White House was eager to dial down tensions. The Iranians had already attempted to shoot down a smaller US drone earlier in the week, and the two episodes are a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation, with US and Iranian forces operating in close proximity. The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps had earlier characterised the incident as a clear warning to Washington. Mr Trump appears to be holding out the possibility that not everyone in Tehran is following the same playbook, perhaps leaving space for more moderate voices there similarly to reduce the tension. On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen gets close access to stricken oil tanker It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. On Monday Iran also announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year. Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone,externalwith a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement. This video can not be played Adel al-Jubeir: Iran's behaviour ""not acceptable and must stop"" The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year.

The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. This is the first direct incident of the current crisis involving the US and Iranian militaries and is a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation in the Gulf. As far as the Iranians are concerned, the downing of the drone was intended to send a clear and explicit message to the Americans - ""our borders are our red line"" - a point underscored by the IRGC's commander-in-chief. So there is no doubting who shot down the US drone, an MQ-4C Triton. It is a massive aircraft with a wing-span equivalent to a small airliner. But the two sides differ as to where it happened. The Iranians say it was in their airspace; the Americans say that it was not. According to some reports, US President Donald Trump himself is eager to dial down the tension, fearing a spillover into outright conflict. But this is just the kind of incident that could provoke just such a cycle of action and response.

"Kemi Badenoch (R) said Stella Creasy's intervention was ""hugely disappointing"" Calls to allow maternity cover for MPs ""divert attention"" from the needs of other women, a Tory MP has said. Kemi Badenoch - who is currently pregnant - said MPs who are mothers are treated well, adding: ""We should not present ourselves as victims."" It comes after Labour MP Stella Creasysaid women are forced to choose between being an MP and a mumbecause of Parliament's rules. MPs do not automatically get paid cover if they take parental leave. In January,MPs backed a year-long trialto allow MPs who were about to give birth or had recently become a parent to nominate another MP to vote on their behalf in the Commons. But there is no official maternity cover available for their other duties. However, MPs continue to be paid their full annual salary of Â£79,468 throughout their parental leave. Creasy 'forced to choose to be MP or mum' UK 'among least family friendly in Europe' Walthamstow MP Ms Creasy, who is also pregnant, argued that without paid cover it would be ""impossible"" for her to fulfil her responsibilities to constituents once her baby is born. When she approached Ipsa - the body which regulates MPs' pay - about the issue, she said they told her ""they don't recognise that MPs go on maternity leave"". Writing in the Times,external, Mrs Badenoch said Ms Creasy's intervention was ""hugely disappointing"" and was ""diverting attention away from those we should be helping"". The MP for Saffron Walden - who is six months pregnant and had two children before becoming an MP - said she had ""greater autonomy"" while pregnant in her current role than in her previous careers. ""I would find it hard to claim to a constituent on the minimum wage that I have a bad deal,"" she added. Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave. They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory). They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£149 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower). Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at Â£149 a week. Ms Badenoch argued it was ""unrealistic"" to have job shares or parental cover for MPs, as the replacement would not be able to vote on issues in parliament. While she said she was ""horrified"" to hear about MPs working in the final stages of a difficult pregnancy or just after giving birth, she said there was ""absolutely no compulsion to do this"" and MPs should resist these ""unreasonable pressures"". She added that all MPs receive a budget of Â£150,000 for staffing costs and said this could be used to cover any period of absence by an MP. This video can not be played Stella Creasy says she led a knife crime meeting following a miscarriage Ms Creasyhas written to party leaders calling for them to support parental leave funding for MPs,external. Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Ipsa to ""look very closely"" at what further support could be provided, adding there was ""much more to do"" to make Westminster more family friendly.

Lib Dem leadership hopeful Jo Swinson said Parliament should be ""setting the standard"" on maternity rights. ""If we want to take a lead on tackling this discrimination in the workplaces right across the country, we also need to get our own house in order,"" the party's deputy leader said. Ipsa said it offered additional funding for MPs to cover absences. For this to be provided, it asks for an explanation of how the money would be spent. The regulator said it supported allowing parental cover for MPs but that the change would need to be decided by Parliament. ""Ipsa would work closely with Parliament on any changes they wish to introduce and on providing the funding to support this,"" a spokeswoman added. The debate over Parliament's rules was reignitedwhen Labour MP Tulip Siddiq delayed a Caesarean section to attend a vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal.

" By Mobeen Azhar I was born and raised in Huddersfield. It’s the town I lived in for the first 18 years of my life, and it’s a place that's still close to my heart.It’s where I got my first job as a journalist on a local newspaper before leaving to pursue my career. So, when the police shooting of a 28-year-old man, rumoured to be a gangster, made national headlines I decided it was time to return to my hometown and start asking some questions. Yassar Yaqub was was shot and killed by police on 2 January 2017 Yassar Yaqub was was shot and killed by police on 2 January 2017 The investigation lasted almost two years, and its findings suggested links between Huddersfield and the national and international drugs trade. I found out that British Pakistanis are significantly overrepresented when it comes to convictions for intent to supply class A drugs in Yorkshire and Humber. Why was this happening in my community, and was there a link with the death of a local man namedYassar Yaqub? Trying to answer these questions would lead me to confront the painful truth that my once sleepy, northern hometown now seemed to be a hotbed of violence, gangs and drug dealing.   After he was shot, there was an outpouring of support for Yassar, who left behind two young kids. His friends spoke movingly of him as a “loving guy”. His parents, understandably, were distraught. His mum mourned passionately and publicly, while his dad demanded answers. A Justice for Yassar banner on display near his family home in Huddersfield A Justice for Yassar banner on display near his family home in Huddersfield It was early 2018 when I first met Yassar’s dad, Mohammed Yaqub. By that time, Yassar’s death had become one of the biggest news stories ever linked to Huddersfield. The car he was travelling in was forced to stop by unmarked police cars. Soon after, an officer opened fire and Yassar was shot and killed. I wanted to know, how did a young man from my hometown end up being shot by the police on a motorway slip road? Within weeks, I was invited into the Yaqub family home. The house dominates the street it’s on, with multiple security cameras visible to anyone walking past. I knew Yassar’s dad was a successful businessman and he happily admitted to giving his son everything he wanted. “I wish I had spoilt him even more,” he told me. Mohammed Yaqub, Yassar's dad Mohammed Yaqub, Yassar's dad Yassar had been living with his parents when he died. I was shown around his bedroom, unchanged since his death, and heard how he liked designer clothes and “looking after himself”. Contrary to rumours of a gangster lifestyle, Mohammed said his son had worked for the family’s luxury car business and that he had just £68 in his bank account when he died. Mohammed invited me to cover one of the Justice 4 Yassar campaign rallies in May 2018. The gathering, complete with banners and balloons to markwhat would have been Yassar's 30th birthday, took place just off the M62, in the same place where Yassar was shot and killed by a police officer. The rally drew a crowd of between 50 and 100 people including Yassar’s family and many of his closest friends. Mohammed told me that he believed his son’s death was an “assassination” and that his “only reason for living now” was to get justice. Friends and family gather at the site where Yassar Yaqub was shot by police Friends and family gather at the site where Yassar Yaqub was shot by police It was hard to get an idea of what Yassar was really like just from talking to people who knew him at the campaign rally. They tended to speak about him in quite a general way, telling me things like Yassar was “the nicest guy” who would “buy your shopping for you.” Any further questions would often result in silence or people asking me not to quote them. Later that year, Mohsin Amin, 32, Rexhino Arapaj, 28, and David Butlin, 39, the men with whom Yassar had spent his final hours, would go on trial for agun offence. These men were all friends of Yassar and had been travelling with him on the M62 in the last moments of his life. If Yassar had been alive, he would have been facing the same charge ofconspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. I hoped the trial would give me an unfiltered insight into who Yassar Yaqub really was. Soon after returning to my hometown, I began hanging out on Blacker Road - the street I lived on for the first 16 years of my life. Birkby is an area that has a large Pakistani population, and Blacker Road is the busiest part of the neighbourhood. Just drinking tea in one of the takeaways, near my old house, meant I’d bump into people I’d grown up with. The response was always warm and I got to chat to people I hadn’t seen for decades. I had my notepad in hand, so it was only a matter of time before people would ask, “What are you doing back?” My response, and particularly the name “Yassar Yaqub”, were like kryptonite. Over and over again, people I knew and trusted would explain that they “wouldn’t want to be seen” to say anything. Words like “rumour”, “stories” and “snitch” would come up. When I’d ask for an explanation, the conversation would stand still. I could see fear in their eyes. Some people even said I should be careful about what I was getting myself into. I knew the case had everyone talking. So why the silence? Most people went quiet when I mentioned Yassar's name Most people went quiet when I mentioned Yassar's name I’d been aware of the rumour that Yassar Yaqub had been involved in drug dealing.Local news reportsabout his death, and the subsequent Justice 4 Yassar campaign, mentioned that opinion was divided about whether or not Yassar was involved in criminality. It’s an allegation his dad has strenuously and consistently denied, telling me that rumours about drug dealing were “completely false”. While I was working out what to make of it all, a more immediate story started unfolding around me. It was a cold winter night. The sky was lit up by blue flashing lights. The sound of a helicopter rumbled in the distance. Two men had run into a local takeaway on Blacker Road trailing blood. They’d been stabbed. By the time I arrived on the scene, the men were in hospital but the blood stains they’d left on the floor of the shop were still visible. The shopkeeper showed me pictures he'd taken of the scene The shopkeeper showed me pictures he'd taken of the scene Since my return to Huddersfield, I had heard talk of a rise in violence across town. So I decided to stick around and investigate. That was how I came to be standing on my old road staring at a wall of police vehicles - trying to see if anyone could shed light on what had just happened. A young butcher told me the incident started in a local park - less than 50 metres from my childhood home - the two men had run into the takeaway for help. When I asked if the stabbing victims were “apne” (which loosely translates from Urdu as “one of our own”), the answer was yes. It was clear from everyone’s reaction that this wasn’t a one-off. When I spoke to the owner of the takeaway he said that, in his opinion, violent incidents in the area were on the rise. He also said that local dealers sometimes came to buy food from him, but that he left them alone for fear they might pull a knife or a gun on him. I almost couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I remembered this town as a calm, happy place. Days later, while I was still trying to get my head around the double stabbing on my old street, I heard there had been another incident nearby - a shooting in broad daylight. Since when did that happen that in my hometown? Over the following weeks and months, I saw more police tape in Huddersfield than I’ve ever seen in London. Each incident would follow the same pattern: families stranded outside because their street was cordoned off; locals reluctantly telling me they’d heard gunshots, seen blood on the floor or witnessed a masked man speeding off into the distance. Once again, people were afraid to talk for fear of retribution. The words “young”, “Pakistani” and “man” kept coming up, as well as suggestions that the violence was the result of some kind of drug turf war. “It’s getting out of control - you can’t pop down to the shop without a bulletproof vest anymore,” one woman said to me, as I stood there, staring in shock at what I was hearing. If shooting and stabbings really were the new normal, this wasn’t the West Yorkshire I remembered. But was I just being nostalgic about my childhood? I began gathering reports. An FOI submitted by a local newspaper showed that, from when Yassar Yaqub was killed in January 2017 to August 2018, more than95 incidentsinvolving firearms had occurred in the Kirklees district (of which Huddersfield is the largest town). In the two years prior to Yassar’s death, there were almost another 100 firearms-related incidents in the same area. This meant that, at that time, there had been almost 200 incidents involving guns reported in my area in less than four years. The violence was clustered in areas like Birkby where I used to live or Fartown where I went to school. The more shocking events I witnessed, and the more I read about the spike in violence, the more I wanted to find out what was fuelling it - and how, if at all, Yassar Yaqub fitted into the story. I was shocked to discover how much violence had occurred in the area I'd grown up in I was shocked to discover how much violence had occurred in the area I'd grown up in Many of the locations that had been reported as the scenes of shootings by the local news over the last few years were familiar to me, but one address in particular stood out. It was the street Yassar used to live on but there was no mention of his name in the report. I did some digging and found that Rexhino Arapaj, one of Yassar’s friends who was with him the night he died, had uploaded a picture to Facebook on the same day a shooting was reported on that street. The image featured Yassar splattered with blood with the caption “Team Soldiers”. Arapaj also wrote “my bro got shot”. That post made it look like Yassar had been involved with at least one of the recent shootings. But what kind of “team” had he been on? And if Yassar’s friends saw him as a “soldier”, what kind of war was he fighting? A post on a friend's social media suggested Yassar had been shot before A post on a friend's social media suggested Yassar had been shot before Twenty miles down the road from Yassar’s home, at Leeds Crown Court, Arapaj and Yassar’s two other associates were standing trial. Their first day in court was 13 November 2018. Every day, Yassar’s dad, Mohammed, sat directly behind me and every day, first thing in the morning and when court adjourned, I would ask him for an interview. Initially, he’d tell me to “call him later” or suggest he would “speak to me in a few days” but as details of Yassar’s life came out in court, it seemed like his dad no longer wanted to speak to me. The prosecution lawyer pointed out that the men on trial had responded “no comment” to many of the questions put to them just after their arrests. Butlin and Amin both said that they had just seen their friend shot and killed and their answers were “down to shock”. But in court, when the prosecution asked Amin if Yassar Yaqub was a drug dealer, he responded, “Yes. He sold drugs.” This was just one of a series of revelations about the life Yassar was living. A machete and body armour were found by the police in his bedroom. A gun, ammunition and a silencer were in the footwell of the car Yassar was travelling in when he died. The suggestion of criminality was clearly more than just a rumour. As the scale of the violence across Huddersfield started to sink in, it became clear that Yassar's death was part of a bigger story. To get to the bottom of it all, I realised I needed to do more than rely on courtroom revelations. I started making contact with people at all levels of the drug trade in and around Huddersfield, from drug users to kingpins, to find out what they knew about Yassar. “The beef now is mainly cos of drugs,” a teenage dealer told me. “That’s what’s causing all the shootings, stabbings. Huddersfield is a small place, so anywhere you go you’re gonna see someone you got a problem with.” I saw first-hand the role young British Pakistani men were playing in the West Yorkshire heroin trade. According to one source, it was quite common for dealers to go straight from selling drugs, over to their local mosque, then back out on the street after prayer to carry on their business. I even heard anecdotes about wholesale heroin prices going up around the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as dealers put their business on ice. One of the worst things I heard was that some people justified selling drugs because their customers weren’t Muslim. “In the Hadith [a major source of religious law and moral guidance for Muslims] it pretty much says that if they’re not Muslim you don’t have to respect them,” a dealer, who knew Yassar, told me. “You don’t have to do for them as you do for your brothers and sisters 'cos they're people not of God.” When I asked the people I met about the morality of dealing drugs, over and over again I heard the same pathetic excuse: “They’re going to buy it from somewhere so it might as well be me.” Their lack of empathy made me sick. The quasi-justifications and references to religion seemed to just be a cover for greed. The human cost of dealing was ignored. Angie, a drug user since she was 15, has struggled with homelessness Angie, a drug user since she was 15, has struggled with homelessness According to a recent report, almostone in every 100 peoplein Yorkshire and Humber has used crack cocaine and other opiates. That’s one of the highest levels in the country. By 2017, drug-related deaths in the area had risen by more than75% in six years. That year, there were more drug-related deaths per year in Yorkshire and Humber than in London. A Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed that while British Pakistanis make up just5% of the urban population of Yorkshire and Humber(according to the most recent census in 2011), in 2016/2017 they accounted for 27% of convictions for possession with intent to supply class A drugs. Of course, the majority of convictions in that 12-month period were among the white British community but that is expected, given that white British people make up the vast majority of the population of the area. So, why were British Pakistanis seemingly so over-represented when it came to convictions for dealing class A drugs? As I tried to understand the reasons behind this, the name Yassar Yaqub started coming up again. One man I made contact with told me Yassar was a “kingpin”, known as “Biggie” in Bradford, who he claimed he had “delivered kilos” to in the past. The street value of one kilo of heroin is £100,000. “He was alright,” my source said of Yassar. “He would help ya, you know what I mean. But if you got beef with him - run basically.” The claim that Yassar was dealing in large amounts of heroin was backed up by multiple sources I spoke to. In December 2018, the man driving the car in whichYassar was shot, Mohsin Amin, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Despite all the evidence - the machete and body armour in Yassar's bedroom, the gun found in the footwell of the car and the confirmation in court that he was a drug dealer - Yassar's dad still denied that his son was a criminal. Mohsin Amin, was sentenced to 18 years in prison Mohsin Amin, was sentenced to 18 years in prison It's completely possible that Yassar was leading a double life and his family knew nothing about his involvement in the drugs trade. I wanted to know just how difficult would it be for a drug dealer to hide their business from their parents? I met up with Naz, a convicted heroin dealer turned youth worker from Bradford. By the time he was 22, he was driving an expensive car and buying all the designer clothes he wanted. His mum thought he was leaving the house to go to a regular job each morning. “If you want to keep something hidden, truly, you can,” says Naz. It was only when he was arrested and eventually convicted that his mum found out where his money came from. The shame of having a son who was a drug dealer was like a “bullet in the head”, says Naz. Former drug dealer Naz says his mum was deeply ashamed when he got arrested Former drug dealer Naz says his mum was deeply ashamed when he got arrested The idea of shame, dishonour or ""besti"", as it is referred to in South Asian cultures, is something I often heard about when speaking to dealers and their families. That was the case for Tanvir, a shopkeeper who also runs a boxing club in the middle of Girlington, a predominantly South Asian part of Bradford. We spoke about the older generation’s work ethic and how most Pakistani immigrants had come to Britain to work hard and make a better life. Tanvir told me the first generation of immigrants “are ashamed of younger people” who are involved in drug dealing and criminality. Tanvir set up a boxing gym in Bradford to try and keep kids off the street Tanvir set up a boxing gym in Bradford to try and keep kids off the street The vast majority of British Pakistanis are law abiding people. There is a tangle of factors driving some men in the community to turn to dealing. The first is cultural. In many Pakistani households (and I know this from my own upbringing), boys are raised and treated like princes. They are free to come and go as they please. They are pampered by their mums and few questions are asked about how they spend their time outside the home. At the same time, many of these boys are taught that, as men, they must be the breadwinner. That the measure of a man is his ability to provide for his family, not in the context of nurturing kids or being a homemaker but, explicitly, and often exclusively, as the financial provider. This is a long-standing cultural norm but, in modern Britain, where youth unemployment in areas likeWest Yorkshire is a significant issue, this pressure can have unexpected consequences. One man told me: “I respect a man who provides for his family, however he’s making his money.” This brings us to the second factor: economics. British Pakistanis are entrepreneurial people. When the community arrived in the UK many people set up takeaways and corner shops. Some worked in manufacturing and did many of the jobs working class white people no longer wanted to do. That was back in the60s and 70s. Three generations later, most of the manufacturing jobs no longer exist. If you’re a young Pakistani man wanting to make money quickly, selling drugs might seem like an option. Many of the manufacturing jobs in West Yorkshire have vanished Many of the manufacturing jobs in West Yorkshire have vanished Add to the mix the fact that the British Pakistani community maintains strong links with its country of origin. Trade between the two nations is worth almost£3 billion today. That trade can, and often does, provide cover for those who want tobring heroin into Britain. Car petrol tanks and baby powder bottles are two methods I heard about from drug importers during my investigation. The majority of the world’s opiates come from thepoppy fields of Afghanistan, separated from neighbouring Pakistan by a porous border. Heroin can be shipped from the Pakistani port city of Karachi. It was no surprise then that all the dealers I met, including the high-level importers, told me the bulk of the heroin they sell comes through Pakistan. So, was the drugs trade just a well-kept secret in my community or was something else going on? It seemed clear to me that, until we tackled this problem, the drugs-related violence in my hometown was only going to get worse. Even before I returned to Huddersfield to begin working on this story, I was aware that many British Pakistanis didn’t want to talk about these type of issues for fear of the far-right capitalising on any perceived wrongdoing among our community. This fear stems partly from the actions of groups like Britain First and the English Defence League, which have used news stories topush an anti-immigrant, anti-Pakistani, anti-Muslim agenda. These groups pedal the “We are not racist” mantra, instead suggesting their only issue is with “Islamisation”. They willtwist headlinesto back up their view of our community. As more than a few people in Huddersfield told me: “They act like we’re all either terrorists or groomers.” I’m aware that those with an agenda will delight in adding drug dealing to the list of wrongdoing and could use it to stoke racist sentiments against my community. But that should not stop us from talking, asking questions and looking for solutions. So many of my peers are, in my opinion, fixated on media bias and the far right. We are hyper defensive with so much energy going into establishing that we “are not all bad” that the possibility that a problem exists can be overlooked. In many circles, the conversation has stalled. That’s not helpful. That refusal to engage with the reality around us reminds me of the Justice 4 Yassar rally I attended at the start of my investigation. I now understand why so many people there were reluctant to talk to me beyond reeling off lines about Yassar being a “great guy”. Since then, it has been established in court that Yassar Yaqub had gone to Bradford to meet a drugs kingpin on the day he died. The meeting is believed to have been about a drugs dispute. It also emerged that, shortly after police forced the car Yassar was in to come to a stop, a plain-clothes officer opened fire and as a result, Yassar lost his life. A gun, along with a silencer and ammunition, was recovered from the car Yassar was in. For any life to end in this way is tragic. Yassar was a dad and a much-loved son. He left behind an entire community that has struggled to process the significance of his life and how it relates to his death. In an attempt to reach out to the community, I asked a local radio station if I could make an appearance on one of their shows. I hoped a phone-in might shed some light on what other Pakistani people in the neighbourhood thought about the issues I'd been investigating. One caller, living in the Birkby area, said they thought local people were “fed up” and wanted issues around violence and drugs “to be sorted”. He pointed out that it’s not just Pakistani people who are involved, but said: “You’ve got to be honest and you’ve got to tackle it within your own community. You can’t hide behind the fact that other people are also doing it, but I think a lot of families are burying their heads in the sand”. Discussing whether or not there had been a rise in violent crime in the Asian community, another local caller, in my view, hit the nail on the head. He said that “disproportionate” reporting of crimes by Asian people can put the community “on the defensive”. However, he added: “Then, the problem that we have is that we have our focus on being negatively portrayed in the media - but then the problem itself is brushed aside”. If any good can come from what happened, it is the acceptance that the only way forward is through talking. Those conversations can be painful. They can be riddled with shame. But, if things are going to change, these conversations need to happen. Hometown: A Killing isavailable to watch on BBC iPlayer, or catch episode two on 26 June on BBC One at 10.40pm.

"Birmingham Archdiocese allegedly knew about abuse by Father John Tolkien in the 1950s Children could have been saved from abuse if the Church had focused less on its reputation, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has said. More than 130 allegations of abuse were made against 78 individuals associated with Birmingham's Catholic Church. Cardinal Vincent Nichols - the city's archbishop between 2000 and 2009 - was accused of focusing on reputation rather than the impact of abuse. He denied a cover-up, but allegations were found to have been ""ignored"". The report said Cardinal Vincent Nichols was too focused on reputation ""I am truly shocked by the scale of sexual abuse within the Archdiocese of Birmingham,"" the inquiry's chair, Professor Alexis Jay, said. The report concluded that ""children could have been saved from abuse if the Church had not been so determined to protect its reputation"". Latest news from the West Midlands Father John Tolkien - son of novelist JRR Tolkien - was said to have admitted abusing boys in Sparkhill, Birmingham, in the 1950s. The archdiocese was apparently aware of the alleged abusebut did not report it until decades later. The report found that the church ""was aware of the risk Father Tolkien posed to children and yet the archdiocese took little or no steps to protect children from those risks"". Former boy scout Christopher Carrie, from Solihull,was given Â£15,000 in compensation in 2003,externalafter he sued the archdiocese. Father Tolkien was deemed too ill to be charged after an investigation into abuse in the Church At the time, the Crown Prosecution Service said Father Tolkien was too ill to be charged, and he died later that year. Cardinal Nichols - now the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales - appeared before the inquiry in December. He was asked if he had suppressed a note which suggested Father Tolkien admitted an allegation of abuse in 1968 and was sent for treatment. However, the report said the note ""was disclosed to the police so it cannot be suggested that the Archdiocese sought to cover up the note"". The note was made by Archbishop of Birmingham Maurice Couve de Murville as part of a 1993 investigation but no action was taken either in 1968 or in 1993. This ""lack of action by the Church meant that abusers were free to continue committing acts of child sexual abuse,"" the inquiry found. The inquiry looked at allegations in Birmingham's Roman Catholic Archdiocese By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor Once again, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has shone light upon dark areas of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales. This report describes an institution where the safeguarding of children was relegated to second, even third place, with the Church much more concerned about reputation management. It also appears that Church leaders preferred secrecy over transparency, assisting some abusive priests to leave the country and others to move from parish to parish. The criticisms of Cardinal Vincent Nichols are particularly scathing. And while it would be tempting to imagine that this is all in the past, the report concludes that ""the archdiocese is still falling short in its child safeguarding arrangements"". As well as Father Tolkien, the investigation focused on three other priests: James Robinson, Samuel Penney, and one who remains anonymous. Father Robinson, described as a serial child abuser, was moved from parish to parish after complaints were first made against him in the 1980s.  The police were never informed and there was no internal, Church-led investigation. He fled the UK in 1985 - later to be tracked down by the BBC at a caravan park in California - after being confronted by a victim. The BBC documentary led to the cardinal issuing a press release complaining about anti-Catholic bias. Despite multiple allegations against him, Father Robinson continued to receive financial support from the Archdiocese for seven years. Cardinal Vincent Nichols (L) shakes hands with Pope Francis He was found guilty in 2010 of 21 child sex abuse offences against four boys - some 40 years after complaints were first made to the Church in the 1970s and 80s. The panel said that the hurt and damage caused by Robinson had been compounded by Cardinal Nichols' press release which ""focused too much on his grievance with the programme makers and too little on the public interest in exposing the abuse committed by the clergy and the harm done to the victims of such abuse"". Father Penney admitted indecently assaulting seven children between 1969 and 1992 and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in 1993. When the Archdiocese was alerted to allegations against Penney, the Vicar General - who was charged with investigating - attempted to help him evade arrest and leave the UK. Prof Jay said the number of perpetrators and victims is ""likely to be far higher than the figures suggest"" and the consequences of the Church's failings ""cannot be overstated"". The report also concluded that the Birmingham Archdiocese continues to fall short in its child safeguarding arrangements. In a statement, the Archdiocese said it accepts it has ""failed victims and survivors"" and apologised for ""the grievous failings we have made in the past"". It said it has ""fundamentally changed its practices and processes to ensure an open and compassionate approach to victims and survivors"".

"The Conservative leadership candidates all know that solving the Brexit conundrum is their number one task. But how do they propose to solve the problems? And if they can't, what are their contingency plans? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the remaining leadership candidates to outline their Brexit proposals. The catch? To answer the questions in 50 words or less. See how they did... How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? First, I'll negotiate a full stop to the backstop - a guarantee it can never be permanent. Second, I'll secure a Union Guarantee in international law so that our United Kingdom cannot be undermined. Third, I'll secure a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement which takes back control of our laws, borders and money. How would you get the deal through Parliament? I would involve Conservative MPs in shaping our negotiating stance and install a negotiating team led by politicians. My Union Guarantee will help me secure the support of the DUP. I also have a track record working across political divides, and would work with opposition MPs committed to Brexit. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I want to deliver Brexit as soon as possible and before 31 October. However, I have said that if it will take a few more days or weeks to finalise a deal, I would be prepared to contemplate a short delay. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I will always choose Brexit over no Brexit. So if it ultimately came to a choice, I would choose no deal over no Brexit. I led the Vote Leave campaign. I am determined to finish what I started and ensure we leave the EU. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? This is a false choice. We need to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit before there is an election. We must not blunder into a confidence vote which we could lose. I am categorically opposed to a second referendum, which is only advocated for by people who want to remain. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? To leave. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We are not pretending it's going to be easy but the EU doesn't want no deal and there is a deal to be done if the right team is sent to negotiate it. I will present Brussels with a credible plan and a new negotiating team so they have confidence it can get through Parliament. How would you get the deal through Parliament? We have to deal with the biggest issue Parliament has which is the backstop that could leave the UK permanently trapped in the customs union against its will. Changing the deal to address this concern, while maintaining support from across the Conservative Party and DUP, will get Brexit delivered. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I have always believed that if the only way to deliver Brexit was through no deal, then I would pursue that. But I would not pursue no deal, with all the risks it involves, if there was the chance of a good deal. What I would not do is set a hard stop on 31 October by which we would be forced into no deal, even if it meant an election and Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I started my own business and negotiated for every day of my professional life -  I am wholly focused on making sure it succeeds. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We have to give the country better choices than these, and as an experienced negotiator who understands European leaders, I am best placed to do that. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? We don't want another referendum, but if there was one I would vote to leave. The people have decided and the democratic risk of not delivering their decision is colossal. We have to get on with it and that's exactly what I would do. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We need to focus on the one thing that's needed to get a deal through Parliament: alternative arrangements to the backstop. And we need to work with Ireland - the key player in this - to deliver those arrangements, beginning with a bold offer to pick up their costs for technological solutions. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already voted for the current withdrawal agreement with changes to the backstop. That's why it's what I'd focus on securing with the EU. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? We need to leave the EU on 31 October. I am confident we can agree a deal - and Parliament will support what it has already voted for in the past. But if it comes to a choice between no deal, and no Brexit, I would have to back no deal. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? No deal is the default if Parliament cannot agree a deal - and I would make sure we are fully prepared for it. But we have to be honest about what the choice is. We cannot accept no Brexit as an outcome. So either we agree a deal, or leave without one on 31 October. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We can't reduce this debate to false choices. We've asked the public too many times already for their views on Brexit. Once should have been enough. They want us to get on with it now. Asking yet again would risk irreparable damage to trust in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? I've been clear we need to get on with Brexit - no second referendum. The people delivered a clear instruction to the British people, and as I said at the time it is our job as elected politicians to deliver it, however we voted at the time. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? It's clear that the prime minister's deal is dead - having been rejected by Parliament three times. We should have come out by March and both of the main political parties are paying the price for failing to do so. We now need to make sure we come out on 31 October, come what may, and we need to show that we are serious about leaving with no deal. To be clear, I don't want no deal, but it's only by being serious you can be confident of getting a new, better deal. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already made clear that it is willing to vote for a better deal, and last week made clear that it wasn't willing to take no deal off the table. I am confident that, so long as we can address MPs' concerns with the old withdrawal agreement, we can strike a new deal that Parliament will want to vote for. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I am not planning for failure. Politics has changed since 29 March, and I believe that MPs now realise they need to deliver on the result of the referendum, or risk a devastating breach in public confidence in our politics. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? Again, I am not planning for failure. We must deliver on the democratic wishes of the British people. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? Neither. It's clear that the public doesn't want to us to force them to vote again. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? Leave, but there isn't going to be another referendum if I become prime minister. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? I would not negotiate a new deal with the EU. I would take through the deal we have already got. Pretending that we can get a different deal out of Brussels is simply a recipe for more uncertainty and delay. How would you get the deal through Parliament? All deals have to go through Parliament. The current deal has 270 votes. We need 45 more. The European Elections are an electric shock which will make MPs determined to get Brexit done. There is only one door - Parliament. And one key - getting a majority. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? My plan B would be a Brexit Assembly. It worked in Ireland to resolve the impasse on abortion. While Parliament will always remain sovereign, the Assembly would present a clear recommendation on the best way forward to break the deadlock. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? In the end I - like everyone else - would have to return to getting a deal through Parliament. Parliament is sovereign. It is the only law-making body in the country. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We will only have to face that hideous choice in the future if we fail to engage with reality now. As leader I would avoid both by getting a deal through Parliament. I do not want to see a general election until 2022, and I think a second referendum would be deeply damaging to this country as well as to faith in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? It's because I am the only candidate engaging with the reality of delivering on the result of the first referendum that I can confidently say we won't be having a second.

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to split from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to set up their own foundation. Prince Harry and Meghan will break away from the Royal Foundation and hope to establish a new charity by the end of the year, according to royal aides. The couples will continue to work together on initiatives such as the Heads Together mental health campaign. The foundation said the royals were ""incredibly proud"" of their joint work. Set up in 2009, the Royal Foundation focused on causes close to the princes' hearts, including the armed forces, conservation and mental health. In a statement, the charity - which will be renamed the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - said the decision was made after a review of its structure. The four royals held the first - and so far only - Royal Foundation forum together in London in 2018 ""These changes are designed to best complement the work and responsibilities of Their Royal Highnesses as they prepare for their future roles, and to better align their charitable activity with their new households,"" it added. ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are incredibly proud of what they have achieved together through the Royal Foundation,"" it said. Royals launch mental health text line Meghan to 'shine light' on women's rights Catherine joined after she became Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 and Meghan joined shortly before she and Harry were married in May 2018. The couples took to the stage together at the charity's first forum in London in February 2018. The charity's title was later officially changed to The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The move by the Sussexes is seen as the final step in the division of the couples' public duties. The royal charity said the dukes and duchesses were ""incredibly proud"" of the work they have done together The Heads Together campaign was launched in 2016 by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry to end the stigma around mental health Earlier this year the duke and duchess split from the household of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate live with their children. Prince Harry and Meghan appointed a separate head of communications andset up their own Instagram account.

"The Conservative leadership candidates all know that solving the Brexit conundrum is their number one task. But how do they propose to solve the problems? And if they can't, what are their contingency plans? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the remaining leadership candidates to outline their Brexit proposals. The catch? To answer the questions in 50 words or less. See how they did... How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? First, I'll negotiate a full stop to the backstop - a guarantee it can never be permanent. Second, I'll secure a Union Guarantee in international law so that our United Kingdom cannot be undermined. Third, I'll secure a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement which takes back control of our laws, borders and money. How would you get the deal through Parliament? I would involve Conservative MPs in shaping our negotiating stance and install a negotiating team led by politicians. My Union Guarantee will help me secure the support of the DUP. I also have a track record working across political divides, and would work with opposition MPs committed to Brexit. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I want to deliver Brexit as soon as possible and before 31 October. However, I have said that if it will take a few more days or weeks to finalise a deal, I would be prepared to contemplate a short delay. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I will always choose Brexit over no Brexit. So if it ultimately came to a choice, I would choose no deal over no Brexit. I led the Vote Leave campaign. I am determined to finish what I started and ensure we leave the EU. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? This is a false choice. We need to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit before there is an election. We must not blunder into a confidence vote which we could lose. I am categorically opposed to a second referendum, which is only advocated for by people who want to remain. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? To leave. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We are not pretending it's going to be easy but the EU doesn't want no deal and there is a deal to be done if the right team is sent to negotiate it. I will present Brussels with a credible plan and a new negotiating team so they have confidence it can get through Parliament. How would you get the deal through Parliament? We have to deal with the biggest issue Parliament has which is the backstop that could leave the UK permanently trapped in the customs union against its will. Changing the deal to address this concern, while maintaining support from across the Conservative Party and DUP, will get Brexit delivered. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I have always believed that if the only way to deliver Brexit was through no deal, then I would pursue that. But I would not pursue no deal, with all the risks it involves, if there was the chance of a good deal. What I would not do is set a hard stop on 31 October by which we would be forced into no deal, even if it meant an election and Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I started my own business and negotiated for every day of my professional life -  I am wholly focused on making sure it succeeds. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We have to give the country better choices than these, and as an experienced negotiator who understands European leaders, I am best placed to do that. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? We don't want another referendum, but if there was one I would vote to leave. The people have decided and the democratic risk of not delivering their decision is colossal. We have to get on with it and that's exactly what I would do. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We need to focus on the one thing that's needed to get a deal through Parliament: alternative arrangements to the backstop. And we need to work with Ireland - the key player in this - to deliver those arrangements, beginning with a bold offer to pick up their costs for technological solutions. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already voted for the current withdrawal agreement with changes to the backstop. That's why it's what I'd focus on securing with the EU. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? We need to leave the EU on 31 October. I am confident we can agree a deal - and Parliament will support what it has already voted for in the past. But if it comes to a choice between no deal, and no Brexit, I would have to back no deal. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? No deal is the default if Parliament cannot agree a deal - and I would make sure we are fully prepared for it. But we have to be honest about what the choice is. We cannot accept no Brexit as an outcome. So either we agree a deal, or leave without one on 31 October. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We can't reduce this debate to false choices. We've asked the public too many times already for their views on Brexit. Once should have been enough. They want us to get on with it now. Asking yet again would risk irreparable damage to trust in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? I've been clear we need to get on with Brexit - no second referendum. The people delivered a clear instruction to the British people, and as I said at the time it is our job as elected politicians to deliver it, however we voted at the time. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? It's clear that the prime minister's deal is dead - having been rejected by Parliament three times. We should have come out by March and both of the main political parties are paying the price for failing to do so. We now need to make sure we come out on 31 October, come what may, and we need to show that we are serious about leaving with no deal. To be clear, I don't want no deal, but it's only by being serious you can be confident of getting a new, better deal. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already made clear that it is willing to vote for a better deal, and last week made clear that it wasn't willing to take no deal off the table. I am confident that, so long as we can address MPs' concerns with the old withdrawal agreement, we can strike a new deal that Parliament will want to vote for. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I am not planning for failure. Politics has changed since 29 March, and I believe that MPs now realise they need to deliver on the result of the referendum, or risk a devastating breach in public confidence in our politics. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? Again, I am not planning for failure. We must deliver on the democratic wishes of the British people. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? Neither. It's clear that the public doesn't want to us to force them to vote again. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? Leave, but there isn't going to be another referendum if I become prime minister. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? I would not negotiate a new deal with the EU. I would take through the deal we have already got. Pretending that we can get a different deal out of Brussels is simply a recipe for more uncertainty and delay. How would you get the deal through Parliament? All deals have to go through Parliament. The current deal has 270 votes. We need 45 more. The European Elections are an electric shock which will make MPs determined to get Brexit done. There is only one door - Parliament. And one key - getting a majority. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? My plan B would be a Brexit Assembly. It worked in Ireland to resolve the impasse on abortion. While Parliament will always remain sovereign, the Assembly would present a clear recommendation on the best way forward to break the deadlock. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? In the end I - like everyone else - would have to return to getting a deal through Parliament. Parliament is sovereign. It is the only law-making body in the country. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We will only have to face that hideous choice in the future if we fail to engage with reality now. As leader I would avoid both by getting a deal through Parliament. I do not want to see a general election until 2022, and I think a second referendum would be deeply damaging to this country as well as to faith in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? It's because I am the only candidate engaging with the reality of delivering on the result of the first referendum that I can confidently say we won't be having a second.

"Birmingham Archdiocese allegedly knew about abuse by Father John Tolkien in the 1950s Children could have been saved from abuse if the Church had focused less on its reputation, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has said. More than 130 allegations of abuse were made against 78 individuals associated with Birmingham's Catholic Church. Cardinal Vincent Nichols - the city's archbishop between 2000 and 2009 - was accused of focusing on reputation rather than the impact of abuse. He denied a cover-up, but allegations were found to have been ""ignored"". The report said Cardinal Vincent Nichols was too focused on reputation ""I am truly shocked by the scale of sexual abuse within the Archdiocese of Birmingham,"" the inquiry's chair, Professor Alexis Jay, said. The report concluded that ""children could have been saved from abuse if the Church had not been so determined to protect its reputation"". Latest news from the West Midlands Father John Tolkien - son of novelist JRR Tolkien - was said to have admitted abusing boys in Sparkhill, Birmingham, in the 1950s. The archdiocese was apparently aware of the alleged abusebut did not report it until decades later. The report found that the church ""was aware of the risk Father Tolkien posed to children and yet the archdiocese took little or no steps to protect children from those risks"". Former boy scout Christopher Carrie, from Solihull,was given Â£15,000 in compensation in 2003,externalafter he sued the archdiocese. Father Tolkien was deemed too ill to be charged after an investigation into abuse in the Church At the time, the Crown Prosecution Service said Father Tolkien was too ill to be charged, and he died later that year. Cardinal Nichols - now the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales - appeared before the inquiry in December. He was asked if he had suppressed a note which suggested Father Tolkien admitted an allegation of abuse in 1968 and was sent for treatment. However, the report said the note ""was disclosed to the police so it cannot be suggested that the Archdiocese sought to cover up the note"". The note was made by Archbishop of Birmingham Maurice Couve de Murville as part of a 1993 investigation but no action was taken either in 1968 or in 1993. This ""lack of action by the Church meant that abusers were free to continue committing acts of child sexual abuse,"" the inquiry found. The inquiry looked at allegations in Birmingham's Roman Catholic Archdiocese By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor Once again, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has shone light upon dark areas of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales. This report describes an institution where the safeguarding of children was relegated to second, even third place, with the Church much more concerned about reputation management. It also appears that Church leaders preferred secrecy over transparency, assisting some abusive priests to leave the country and others to move from parish to parish. The criticisms of Cardinal Vincent Nichols are particularly scathing. And while it would be tempting to imagine that this is all in the past, the report concludes that ""the archdiocese is still falling short in its child safeguarding arrangements"". As well as Father Tolkien, the investigation focused on three other priests: James Robinson, Samuel Penney, and one who remains anonymous. Father Robinson, described as a serial child abuser, was moved from parish to parish after complaints were first made against him in the 1980s.  The police were never informed and there was no internal, Church-led investigation. He fled the UK in 1985 - later to be tracked down by the BBC at a caravan park in California - after being confronted by a victim. The BBC documentary led to the cardinal issuing a press release complaining about anti-Catholic bias. Despite multiple allegations against him, Father Robinson continued to receive financial support from the Archdiocese for seven years. Cardinal Vincent Nichols (L) shakes hands with Pope Francis He was found guilty in 2010 of 21 child sex abuse offences against four boys - some 40 years after complaints were first made to the Church in the 1970s and 80s. The panel said that the hurt and damage caused by Robinson had been compounded by Cardinal Nichols' press release which ""focused too much on his grievance with the programme makers and too little on the public interest in exposing the abuse committed by the clergy and the harm done to the victims of such abuse"". Father Penney admitted indecently assaulting seven children between 1969 and 1992 and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in 1993. When the Archdiocese was alerted to allegations against Penney, the Vicar General - who was charged with investigating - attempted to help him evade arrest and leave the UK. Prof Jay said the number of perpetrators and victims is ""likely to be far higher than the figures suggest"" and the consequences of the Church's failings ""cannot be overstated"". The report also concluded that the Birmingham Archdiocese continues to fall short in its child safeguarding arrangements. In a statement, the Archdiocese said it accepts it has ""failed victims and survivors"" and apologised for ""the grievous failings we have made in the past"". It said it has ""fundamentally changed its practices and processes to ensure an open and compassionate approach to victims and survivors"".

"Francis called the music industry ""an unmonitored, unregulated cesspit of bad behaviour"" Aluna Francis has spoken for the first time about being sexually assaulted by someone in the music industry. She told BBC podcastThe Next Episodethat the man forced his hands into her underwear, undressed and tried to coerce her into performing oral sex. ""It was like I was in a room with a completely different person,"" said the AlunaGeorge singer. ""His behaviour went from nought to a hundred."" She has not disclosed the name of her alleged attacker. Francis, whose dance duo scored several top 40 singles and were runners-up on theBBC's Sound of 2013 list, said she had been working on a song with the music professional when the alleged attack took place in a hotel room. ""I was like, 'All right mate, calm down. Take your hands out of my pants please',"" she said. Despite her appeals, her alleged attacker's behaviour escalated. ""The last thing that was happening before I really got myself out of there is that he pinned me down and he'd taken his trousers down."" Francis said she had to ""wrestle him off"" to get away. ""I thought that I was okay and I'm just so not,"" she said. The musician hasaddressed sexual misconductpreviously, in her track Mean What I Mean but has never shared details of the attack, which she did not report to police. Allow YouTube content?

Francis told the BBC podcast that the music business, ""is living in the past, an unmonitored, unregulated cesspit of bad behaviour"". ""If a woman wants to stay safe, it's literally down to her to take care of that and navigate choices of whether to take a risk for her career or stay safe and miss out on opportunities."" Other British musicians have come forward and spoken to The Next Episode about their experiences, including Rebecca Taylorwho performs under the name Self Esteemand will be appearing at Glastonbury next week. Taylor is now a solo artist and performs as Self Esteem Taylor, who was formerly in the band Slow Club, said she was sexually harassed by a record label boss. ""It's a label that my then-band really wanted to be on,"" she said, alleging the incident took place on a night out. ""He grabbed my vagina and said, ""Am I going to have a good time?"" she added. Taylor did not disclose the experience to her bandmates at the time. ""I didn't say anything,"" she explained. ""I really still wanted to be on that label and I wasn't just representing myself, I was representing my whole band."" Like Francis, Taylor has not named the alleged perpetrator. ""I don't have the financial success to name someone who would take everything from me,"" she said. While theMe Too movement- in which women have come forward with their experiences of sexual assault - has seen allegations taken to court in the film industry, Francis does not believe there has been any significant impact in the music industry. Rebecca Taylor and Chloe Howl were talking on the first in a series of podcasts looking into sexual misconduct in the music industry ""The Me Too movement barely touched the music industry,"" she said. Brit Awards nominee Chloe Howl told the BBC podcast she was also sexually harassed by someone who worked in the music industry. ""I think until we start valuing the women or the vulnerable people within the music industryâ¦ who have been victimisedâ¦ it's going to be really tricky,"" she said. She added she had taken strength from other women sharing their stories. ""I kind of found my voice a little bit more,"" she explained. ""I was able to have a huge go at the last person who did it."" ""But still it feels like it's women who are having to crusade and educate people about the oppression that they suffer."" Listen toThe Next Episodeon BBC Sounds.

"Philip Hammond is set to warn that a no-deal Brexit would harm the British economy, devour a Â£26.6bn Brexit war chest, and risk the break-up of the UK. The chancellor is expected to say that Conservative candidates who are vying to be the next prime minister must come up with a Brexit plan ""B"". If they do not, he will hint that a second referendum could be needed to break the Parliamentary deadlock. He will also pour cold water on tax and spending pledges by the candidates. Mr Hammond is set to say in a speech at the annual Mansion House dinner in the City of London on Thursday that a no-deal Brexit would soak up Â£26.6bn that has been set aside that could otherwise be spent by an incoming prime minister. In a BBC debate on Tuesday, leadership candidates promised tax cuts and increased spending on public services. However, a no-deal Brexit would mean that was not possible, and would also leave the UK economy ""permanently smaller"", Mr Hammond will say. In March, the chancellor pledged to spend the war chest to boost the economy,if MPs voted to leave the European Union with a deal. UK firms 'not even close to ready' for no deal No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? How the Brexit timetable could unfold Conservative candidates including Boris Johnson havepledged to leave the EU by 31 October, even if that means quitting without a deal. But a no-deal Brexit would ""risk the Union"", Mr Hammond is expected to say. ""I cannot imagine a Conservative and Unionist-led government, actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit; willing to risk the Union and our economic prosperity,"" he will say. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson told party members on Tuesday to ""take a long, hard look at themselves"" after a YouGov survey suggested 63% would back Brexit even if it meant Scotland leaving the UK. In April, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would push for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021if the country, which voted Remain, is taken out of the EU. Mr Hammond is also expected to say that certain ""truths"" will not change no matter who is leader. Unless there is a general election, Parliament will not support a no-deal, and is unlikely to support the deal that has already been negotiated, he will say. So candidates need to spell out their ""Plan B"", he is expected to argue. The EU will not renegotiate Theresa May's Brexit deal, and the problem of the Irish border ""will not go away"", Mr Hammond will add, saying that Tory leadership candidates ""need to be honest with the public"". The chancellor will also caution the men vying to lead his party that they have to ""recognise and address the difficult trade-offs inherent in delivering Brexit"". Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Quick Q&A: Tory candidates' Brexit plans Candidates will also need to say how they will bring about Brexit without harming the economy or breaking up the UK, he will say. The leadership contenders ""need realistic strategies for taking the UK economy out of the holding pattern in which it has been stuck for the last nine months and landing it safely on the runway marked 'prosperity Brexit'"". ""If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in Parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse,"" Mr Hammond will add, hinting at a second referendum, or even a general election. However, Mr Hammond's expected speech was ""yet another example of how far the Tories are cut off from the real world,"" said Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell. ""Hammond's austerity policies have resulted in a near decade of suffering for hungry children, a surge in food bank use, rising in-work poverty, squeezed incomes for families and unprecedented cutbacks to public services,"" he said.

"Shares in Dixons Carphone have plunged after it reported a full-year loss and said its mobile phone arm would make a ""significant loss"" this year. The retailer lost Â£259m in the year to 27 April, compared with a pre-tax profit of Â£289m last year. In December, the retailer wrote down the value of its mobile business, Carphone Warehouse. One analyst said the division was ""on life support"" in an ""evolving"" mobile market. It has suffered because people are renewing their handsets less often and demand for mobile contracts is down. Last year, it announced the closure of 92 of its 700 stores. The company - which also owns the Currys PC World chain - added that it was set to take ""more pain"" in the coming year amid ""a deterioration in the forecast performance of the UK and Ireland mobile business"". Having plunged by about a quarter at the start of trading, Dixons Carphone shares recovered some ground to trade about 12% lower. Group chief executive Alex Baldock said the UK mobile market was ""changing in the way we described in December, but doing so faster"". ""So, we're moving faster to respond."" He said the company had renegotiated all its legacy network contracts with mobile operators, developed a new ""customer offer"" and was accelerating the combination of its mobile and electrical goods businesses. ""This means taking more pain in the coming year, when mobile will make a significant loss,"" he said. However, he added: ""We expect mobile will at least break even within two years, and beyond that, equipped with a stronger and unconstrained offer, we will of course aim to do better."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the ""rapidly evolving"" nature of the mobile business had ""threatened to leave Dixons behind"". ""The mobile business in particular is on life support, draining capital and resources prior to its integration with the electricals business."" The loss reported by Dixons Carphone  was mainly due to one-off charges of Â£557m, the majority of which was caused by the writedown in the value of the Carphone Warehouse business in December. When the charges are stripped out, Dixon's Carphone made a profit of Â£298m - although that was still a 22% fall from the previous year. Revenue across the group dipped 1% to Â£10.43bn. The electrical goods business gained market share in all territories, and Mr Baldock said this side of the company was expected to grow sales and headline profits this year. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director from Fidelity Personal Investing's share dealing service, said: ""While elsewhere in the group the five-year plan is going to plan - if not a little better - the mobile phone business is under considerable strain as customers demand flexibility, are sticking with their old phones for longer and Carphone is dragged down by binding network contracts."" For many years, Carphone Warehouse hasn't sold carphones in warehouses, but despite that, the company has continued to prosper. Now it is suddenly looking about as up-to-date as one of those bricks toted by Michael Douglas in Wall Street. According to analyst Ben Wood at CCS Insight, there's been a sudden and radical change in the way people buy mobile phones. A survey carried out by his firm found a third of consumers saying they intended to hold on to their current phones for longer than their previous handsets - even extending renewal time by a few months means a big drop in annual sales. The UK market peaked in 2012, when 31 million were sold. This year, CCS Insight expects that to fall to below 18 million. And while the habit of going into a shop to research and buy a new phone has been stubbornly persistent, it is now fading. The survey showed 21% of buyers said they did absolutely no research. ""People know what they want,"" says Ben Wood. ""And in any case, all smartphones are pretty samey these days."" With more people buying online or direct from mobile operators, phone shops may soon be another of the High Street's endangered species.

"Young people under 30 are spending less on non-housing items than the same age group in 2001, a new report suggests. The Resolution Foundation think tank studied changes in pay, housing, taxes and benefits to see if it was still true that newer generations are better off than their predecessors were. It found under-30s are spending 7% less than that age group did 18 years ago. Over-65s' spending has risen by 37%. The think tank said it did not want to turn generations against each other. But it said comparing generations was an ""essential tool"" for understanding what is changing in the UK economy and society. Millennials' pay 'scarred' by bank crisis How did the crisis affect your finances? Young face renting 'all their lives' In what it calls its ""intergenerational audit"",,externalthe Resolution Foundation - which aims to improve living standards for those on low to middle incomes - said its research supported the idea that millennials and members of generation X have seen a squeeze on spending for ""fun"". Meanwhile, in terms of pay, people under 30 have seen the biggest recovery in salaries since the financial crash in 2008. But those in their early 30s are being paid 3% less than someone born 10 years earlier, its research suggested. The report also found that for those aged over 50 there is a gender divide: The report finds that women in their late 60s have a little over half the wealth of their male counterparts. The gender difference is not so pronounced among younger generations. The report said there is ""widespread pessimism"" among the UK public about young people's prospects David Willetts, president of the Intergenerational Centre within the think tank, said: ""From frustrations about buying a first home to fears about the cost of care, Britain faces many intergenerational challenges. ""The big living standards gains that each generation used to enjoy over their predecessors have stalled. ""Welcome steps are being made, from stronger pay growth for young millennials to the success of auto-enrolment into pension saving."" Who was to blame for the financial crisis? Millennials 'wrongly relying on inheritance' How I bought a house without mum and dad Throughout the course of the 20th Century, each generation traditionally enjoyed higher living standards than the generations gone before. But there is now widespread pessimism among the UK public about young people's prospects of improving on their predecessors' living standards, the report said. Despite some good news, in its conclusion the think tank said its research suggested Britain ""is a society in which cohort-on-cohort living standards progress is less of a given"". It added that it suggests ""inheritance from family may have more of an impact on individuals' lifetime living standards than how much they earn, with implications for intra-generational inequality"".

"Boohoo's first recycled range will be made with reclaimed plastics ""If someone really cared about buying ethically sourced, green clothes then they wouldn't shop at Boohoo,"" shopper Camilla tells the BBC on Oxford Street. She is commenting on the fast fashion retailer's first recycled clothing range - made with reclaimed plastics - which was unveiled this week. The 22-year-old's view is not surprising, given the millions of low cost, fast fashion clothes that Boohoo sells every year. But while it's easy to dismiss the move as a marketing gimmick, Boohoo claims it is planning other green initiatives, and others have welcomed the new collection as a ""starting point"". ""It is good for people to try recycled clothes and see that they are just like normal clothes,"" says shopper Esme, 16. Could ditching 'fast fashion' make us happier? Ideas to make fashion more eco-friendly turned down ""I'm glad they are engaging because they are unlikely to change their supply chain overnight,"" adds Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion marketing at the University of Manchester. Boohoo says its34-piece range,externalis made with recycled polyester that had been destined for landfills and uses no environmentally unfriendly dyes or chemicals. The dresses, bodysuits, flares and crop tops have also been made entirely in the UK to cut air pollution. Zara is one of a growing number of retailers to launch recycled collections However, some have noted that the range was unveiled on the same day theEnvironmental Audit Committee (EAC) issued a critical reporton the fast fashion industry that mentioned Boohoo. The MPs warned companies were creating huge amounts of waste by selling cheap clothes designed only to be worn a few times. They also said the synthetic fabrics used to make such garments shed micro-fibres when washed, polluting waterways. ""The problem of clothing waste driven by rising volumes and lower prices in recent years are unlikely to be addressed by initiatives [like Boohoo's recycled range],"" says Stella Claxton of Nottingham Trent University, who gave evidence to the EAC. ""We know that too many garments that are disposed of through retailer take-back schemes or in charity collection bins will eventually find their way into landfill."" She also questions just how green Boohoo's recycled fabric will be, noting that even recycled polyester clothing can take hundreds of years to decompose. ""The garments are likely to shed microfibres into waterways when they're machine washed, just like the non recycled versions,"" she adds. In its report, the EAC made 18 proposals, including a 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes, and a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be recycled instead. But the government has said already it will adopt none of the policies. In that light, Dr Perry thinks Boohoo - and others retailers that have launched green clothing ranges - should be encouraged for doing so voluntarily. ""The real test will be if Boohoo can make this financially viable,"" she says. ""Because if they don't carry on then it will seem like a token gesture and them getting on the bandwagon."" Boohoo says it takes its environmental responsibilities ""extremely seriously"" and is encouraging its customers to wear its clothes for longer. ""We have also launched a further consumer awareness programme around washing at lower temperatures, and avoiding ironing and tumble drying where possible.""

"The US military identified the drone as a US Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk (file photo) A US military surveillance drone has been shot down by Iranian forces while flying over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the aircraft had violated Iranian airspace, and that the incident sent a ""clear message to America"". But the US military insisted the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned what it called an ""unprovoked attack"" by the IRGC. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Iran made a very big mistake!"" The incident comes at a time of escalating tension between the two countries. On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen gets close access to stricken oil tanker It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. Tensions were further fuelled on Monday when Iran announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. What we know about Gulf tanker attacks The Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year. The IRGC said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours,externalafter the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech carried live on Iranian state television, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami warned the US to respect Iran's territorial integrity. ""Those who defend the borders of the Islamic nation of Iran will react in a total and decisive way to any intrusions by foreign elements on our land. Our borders are our red line."" He added: ""Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."" The US military's Central Command confirmed a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). Iran said it targeted a US ""spy"" drone after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Reuters news agency later cited a US source as saying US naval assets had been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. This is the first direct incident of the current crisis involving the US and Iranian militaries and is a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation in the Gulf. As far as the Iranians are concerned, the downing of the drone was intended to send a clear and explicit message to the Americans - ""our borders are our red line"" - a point underscored by the IRGC's commander-in-chief. So there is no doubting who shot down the US drone, an MQ-4C Triton. It is a massive aircraft with a wing-span equivalent to a small airliner. But the two sides differ as to where it happened. The Iranians say it was in their airspace; the Americans say that it was not. According to some reports, US President Donald Trump himself is eager to dial down the tension, fearing a spillover into outright conflict. But this is just the kind of incident that could provoke just such a cycle of action and response. Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone,externalwith a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement. The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June:Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz.

"The two leaders have never met in North Korea before China's President Xi Jinping has met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the first Chinese state visit to Pyongyang in 14 years. The leaders were expected to discuss economic issues and the stalled talks over North Korea's nuclear programme. It was their fifth meeting in 15 months, but the first to have taken place in North Korea. Both leaders are currently in separate disputes with the US - China over trade and North Korea over nuclear weapons. Who's sending aid to North Korea? North Korea crisis in 300 words Thursday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since a summit held by Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump ended in February without any agreement on denuclearisation. It also comes just a week before Mr Xi is set to meet the US president at the G20 summit in Japan. Thousands of people lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president to the country on Thursday morning, with video footage shared by Chinese state media showing crowds waving flowers and banners as his motorcade passed through Pyongyang. People lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president The leaders then held talks, in which Mr Xi praised Pyongyang's efforts towards denuclearisation and said he hoped that North Korea and the US could keep talking and make progress, according to Chinese media reports. Mr Xi's two-day visit is the first by any Chinese leader to North Korea in 14 years and his first since taking power in 2012. It is being seen as a boost for Mr Kim, who has been struggling to maintain momentum after a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year. The two leaders will inevitably discuss the stalled nuclear negotiations and the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Why N Korea called Biden an 'imbecile' What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Analysts say Mr Xi will want to know what happened and whether any way can be found to move things forward, information he could then share with Mr Trump in Japan. China wants North Korea to stop missile testing Although the visit was confirmed only earlier this week, Jenny Town, managing editor of US-based analysis site 38 North, says it is not a huge surprise that it is happening now, with the 70th anniversary of the two countries establishing diplomatic ties approaching. She says there might be some ""symbolic value"" in the visiting taking place just before the G20 summit, but that it's ""more of a bonus than a deciding factor"". China's main goal is stability in North Korea and economic co-operation, and ensuring that it remains a significant party in the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme. The two communist-led states are old allies. But ties have been strained over the past decade, with Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions viewed critically by Beijing. In June 2018, Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump met for the first time The official China Daily newspaper said on Wednesday that the visit would allow the two leaders to ""agree on some concrete co-operation projects"". And in a rare front page editorial in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Wednesday, Mr Xi reiterated his support for nuclear talks, saying: ""China supports North Korea for maintaining the right direction in resolving the issue of the Korean peninsula politically."" North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Everything about North Korea in nine charts In pictures: Growing up in North Korea The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers The visit will enable Mr Kim to show that he still has China's support, as other relationships are struggling. ""The North Koreans want to keep their friends close even if there isn't a lot of trust and a lot of goodwill between them,"" says Ms Town. This video can not be played North Korea has been called out for evading UN sanctions North Korea's economy is struggling under the international sanctions regime, put in place because of its repeated nuclear and missile tests. China, its biggest trading partner, has backed those sanctions but has indicated it would be in favour of some sanctions relief as an incentive for North Korea to denuclearise. ""China has proved to be the main destination for most of North Korea's exports, including minerals, fish, textiles, and also workers,"" North Korea analyst Peter Ward told the BBC. Beijing traditionally is also the main importer of goods for North Korea's industry and households. Under current sanctions, a lot of this trade has come to a halt. ""China would prefer to relax UN sanctions in these areas,"" Mr Ward says. ""It wants to ensure that North Korea's economy grows at a fair pace and that the North does not feel the need to test ballistic missiles and/or nuclear weapons again."" Given that sanctions are not likely to get lifted, there is little China can do. But Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told Reuters that Chinese economic support - possibly even China creating a ""hole"" in sanctions - would mean Mr Kim ""doesn't have to negotiate with the US from a position of weakness"". ""It can have both nuclear weapons and economic aid from China,"" he said.

"The US military identified the drone as a US Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk (file photo) A US military surveillance drone has been shot down by Iranian forces while flying over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the aircraft had violated Iranian airspace, and that the incident sent a ""clear message to America"". But the US military insisted the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned what it called an ""unprovoked attack"" by the IRGC. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Iran made a very big mistake!"" The incident comes at a time of escalating tension between the two countries. On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen gets close access to stricken oil tanker It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. Tensions were further fuelled on Monday when Iran announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. What we know about Gulf tanker attacks The Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year. The IRGC said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours,externalafter the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech carried live on Iranian state television, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami warned the US to respect Iran's territorial integrity. ""Those who defend the borders of the Islamic nation of Iran will react in a total and decisive way to any intrusions by foreign elements on our land. Our borders are our red line."" He added: ""Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."" The US military's Central Command confirmed a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). Iran said it targeted a US ""spy"" drone after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Reuters news agency later cited a US source as saying US naval assets had been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. This is the first direct incident of the current crisis involving the US and Iranian militaries and is a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation in the Gulf. As far as the Iranians are concerned, the downing of the drone was intended to send a clear and explicit message to the Americans - ""our borders are our red line"" - a point underscored by the IRGC's commander-in-chief. So there is no doubting who shot down the US drone, an MQ-4C Triton. It is a massive aircraft with a wing-span equivalent to a small airliner. But the two sides differ as to where it happened. The Iranians say it was in their airspace; the Americans say that it was not. According to some reports, US President Donald Trump himself is eager to dial down the tension, fearing a spillover into outright conflict. But this is just the kind of incident that could provoke just such a cycle of action and response. Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone,externalwith a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement. The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June:Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz.

"The two leaders have never met in North Korea before China's President Xi Jinping has met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the first Chinese state visit to Pyongyang in 14 years. The leaders were expected to discuss economic issues and the stalled talks over North Korea's nuclear programme. It was their fifth meeting in 15 months, but the first to have taken place in North Korea. Both leaders are currently in separate disputes with the US - China over trade and North Korea over nuclear weapons. Who's sending aid to North Korea? North Korea crisis in 300 words Thursday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since a summit held by Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump ended in February without any agreement on denuclearisation. It also comes just a week before Mr Xi is set to meet the US president at the G20 summit in Japan. Thousands of people lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president to the country on Thursday morning, with video footage shared by Chinese state media showing crowds waving flowers and banners as his motorcade passed through Pyongyang. People lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president The leaders then held talks, in which Mr Xi praised Pyongyang's efforts towards denuclearisation and said he hoped that North Korea and the US could keep talking and make progress, according to Chinese media reports.

"This video can not be played Remi Yeomans, two, attends a hospice which is facing closure in the West Midlands Children's hospices in England will be forced to cut services or shut unless the NHS increases its funding, a charity has warned. Together for Short Lives, which helps terminally ill children, highlighted a ""dangerous cocktail"" of higher costs and a drop in state funding. Its report examined funding for 27 of the 34 children's hospices in England. But NHS England said funding for children's end-of-life care was ""going up every year"". Cash-strapped children's hospice to close How hospices care for the terminally ill According to Together for Short Lives, children's hospices in England each spend an average of Â£3.7m per year - which works out as a total annual spend across the country of Â£125m. Their spending has increased by 4.5% since 2016/17, it said. But the percentage which the state contributes has fallen from 27% to 21% in five years, the report said - and hospices have been forced to use their reserve funds or stop services. One of the hospices, Acorns in Walsall, West Midlands,has said it will have to closelater this year unless it can raise more than Â£1.5m. If it closed, it would mean more than 200 children would lose vital support or be forced to travel long distances, and 70 jobs would be lost. Another hospice, Forget Me Not in West Yorkshire and north Manchester, said the lack of council and NHS funding ""has a huge impact"" on the care they can provide. ""We have two hospices: we cannot fully open our Bury hospice yet despite having amazing facilities and families desperate to access them because it receives no funding from the NHS,"" said chief executive Luen Thompson. ""Our Huddersfield hospice receives less than 3% in statutory funding of the Â£4 million it needs to run. ""Our offer to families shouldn't depend on how much we raise at a bucket collection or how much bric-a-brac we sell in one of our shops."" The hospice remembering children in birdsong How do you talk about dying to someone who is dying? The head of Together for Short Lives, Andy Fletcher, said the situation at Acorns could be ""just the tip of the iceberg"". ""It is simply not sustainable to expect specialist children's palliative care services provided by children's hospices to be funded by charity reserves and the generosity of the public,"" he said. The charity wants the NHS to increase the Children's Hospice Grant from Â£12m in 2019/20 to Â£25m per year. Mr Fletcher also said NHS funding was ""patchy"", with the research showing one hospice receiving 48% of its charitable expenditure from the state in the last financial year but another getting just 7%. And one in six hospices said they had received no funding from their local clinical commissioning groups in 2018/19. An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""NHS funding for children's end of life care is going up every year and is set to more than double within the next five years, with up to Â£25m going in to care as part of the NHS Long Term Plan. ""We are working with local health groups - including councils which of course have an important role to play in these services - and Together for Short Lives to provide the kind of support that children and their families want.""

"Tory MPs have voted in the latest stage of their leadership race, with the man who comes last set to be eliminated. The remaining field of four candidates will be whittled down to three in a secret ballot. The result are expected at about 13:00 BST. There will then be a further vote to select the final two, one of whom will be elected leader by party members. Boris Johnson topped Wednesday's third ballot with 143 votes, ahead of Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid. International Development Secretary Rory Stewart was knocked out of the contest on Wednesday evening, after he secured the backing of just 27 Tory MPs. Mr Johnson is almost certain to make the run-off of 160,000 or so Conservative members who will elect the next Tory leader - and prime minister - in a postal ballot, starting next week. His campaign to be prime minister received an endorsement from Evening Standard editor and former Chancellor George Osborne. LIVE: Tory leadership race final ballots Tory leadership: Compare the candidates running for PM Quick Q&A: Tory candidates' Brexit plans An editorial for the paper argued,externalMr Johnson had ""the best shot"" at uniting the government, getting the country out of ""the Brexit mess"" and help Britain feel ""good about itself again"". Mr Johnson told the paper: ""It is time we had some excitement back into politics"" but added that ""there's also quite a serious job of work to be done"". But the race to join the former foreign secretary in the final two remains too close to call. Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, led Mr Gove by just three votes in the third round of voting, with 54 and 51 supporters respectively. Home Secretary Sajid Javid was in fourth place with 38 votes. He has insisted he will not pull out of the race and it is all to play for. His camp is hoping to attract backers of Mr Stewart. This video can not be played How Rory Stewart was knocked out of contest in the third round Mr Javid's campaign manager, Tory MP Robert Halfon, said the home secretary was ""the outsider"" but that he had support from across the party and was also picking up votes from former supporters of other candidates. Mr Stewart said he ""will not be declaring for anyone"" on Thursday, but will be voting later. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were all kinds of possibilities regarding potential alliances and pacts between the candidates chasing Mr Johnson. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd - who backs Mr Hunt - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was not ""resigned"" to Mr Johnson becoming prime minister. ""We haven't seen much of Boris,"" she said, adding that there were 16 hustings coming up over three weeks, with plenty of opportunities for members to decide who would be the best prime minister and ""not just a good campaigner"". Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is now backing Mr Johnson after initially supporting eliminated candidate Dominic Raab, told Today Mr Johnson would be a ""very good prime minister"". He said he was lending his support as Mr Johnson had assured him the UK would leave the EU on 31 October under his premiership. Mr Davis also defended Mr Johnson's championing as London mayor of the Garden Bridge project, which eventually collapsed despite Â£43m of public investment, saying it was a ""single mistake"". After nine days and three rounds, it's almost decision time. Tory MPs will vote, and vote again - perhaps up to late on Thursday night - until there are only two men left. Barring some bizarre implosion, one of them is certain to be Boris Johnson - the politician who despite the wilful rollercoaster, has come determinedly back from the political brink. For many months he was down, but evidently, never truly out. The contest to take him on is fluid and real. Read more from Laura The leadership campaign has, so far, been dominated by Brexit - with the candidates criticising each others' plans for getting the UK out of the EU by the 31 October deadline. Mr Hunt told LBC he believed the EU was prepared to re-open the agreement they reached with Theresa May - rejected three times by MPs - if they found themselves dealing with the ""kind of person they could do business with"". Mr Hunt said the current withdrawal agreement containing the controversial backstop - an insurance policy to maintain an open Irish border  - was ""dead"", and could not get through Parliament. But he said he was confident the EU would listen to the UK if it came up with technological alternatives to the backstop, which they knew commanded the support of MPs. ""If you give them the kind of prime minister they think they can do business with, who is going to be fair and tough, then my reading of this is they do want to solve this,"" he said. It is ""unavoidable"" that Brexit in any form will ""diminish"" the UK, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said there was ""no point"" in having another extension to the Brexit deadline, currently 31 October, if ""traditional talks"" were staying the same. There will be no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, but the UK and the EU could ""look together at the political declaration"", he said. And changes could be made to this if the UK tells the EU how it wants to deal with the Irish border. ""I hate no-deal Brexit from every angle,"" Mr Rutte said, adding that it would have a ""huge impact"" on the UK. He also said no to a transition period without a withdrawal agreement, saying: ""Hard Brexit is hard Brexit, I don't see how you can sweeten it."" Mr Gove told LBC there were always ""twists and turns"" in a leadership race, but he was ""hopeful"" of making it to the final two, given his breadth of support amongst Tory MPs. While he had not spoken to Mr Stewart since his elimination, he said ""having his support would be brilliant"". Although Mr Johnson had ""formidable qualities"", Mr Gove said he felt he would be a better prime minister than his former cabinet colleague and fellow Brexiteer. ""Boris Johnson has communication skills a plenty but when it comes to a forensic examination of Jeremy Corbyn's programme, and a demolition of him in the House of Commons, I believe I would be better equipped than any of the other candidates.""

"Nxivm leader Keith Raniere appearing in court in Brooklyn, New York Keith Raniere, a self-help guru accused of leading a sex cult that enslaved women, has been found guilty of all charges against him. Raniere, 58, was convicted by a jury after a six-week trial in Brooklyn, New York. He allegedly oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in his group, called Nxivm. He was convicted of all counts against him, including racketeering, sex trafficking and child pornography. Mr Raniere, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, could face life in prison. Keith Raniere's Nxivm trial: What we've learned 'Why I joined a cult - and how I left' US heiress pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case Associate pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case During the trial, the court heard how female recruits in the group were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex with Raniere. This video can not be played Raniereâs ex-girlfriend Toni Natalie made a statement outside court Raniere maintained that Nxivm (pronounced nexium) was a self-improvement organisation, but investigators said it was a sex-trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. Recruits were told it was an all-female group and were asked to hand over compromising materials that were later used to blackmail them, prosecutors said. Raniere was arrested by the FBI in Mexico last year. His defence team said the alleged sexual relationships were consensual. When the verdict was read outside court, former members of Nxivm gave the prosecution team a round of applause. Prosecutors claim Mr Raniere oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in the group According to Nxivm's tagline, Raniere and his organisation were ""working to build a better world"". But witnesses called to testify at his trial painted a starkly different picture of the man. Raniere, the court heard, ran a secret society within Nxivm called DOS. As the ""grandmaster"" of DOS, he was a ""predator"" who exploited and blackmailed women, including a 15-year-old girl, prosecutors alleged. Attorneys representing Nxivm leader Keith Raniere argued DOS was merely a ""social club"" Raniere forced his ""slaves"" to give him nude photos of themselves and other compromising materials, telling them they would be made public if they disobeyed him, the court heard. Every August, Nxivm members - called ""Nixians"" - would dole out $2,000 (Â£1,575) or more to gather in Silver Bay, New York to celebrate Raniere's birthday week, according to court documents. US actress pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case 'Sex-slave' group leader arrested by FBI A former member testified that the week included ""tribute ceremonies"" to Raniere, who was referred to as ""The Vanguard"" by his followers. Another former member of the alleged sex cult, identified by prosecutors as Daniela, testified she was ""groomed"" for weeks before she turned 18 for Raniere to take her virginity. The same women was allegedly confined to a bedroom for two years - all because she gained weight and asked to see a man other than Raniere. Photos from the FBI show the branding on one victim, with Mr Raniere's initials, KR, superimposed in white In her closing arguments, prosecutor Moira Penza said Raniere was a ""crime boss with no limits"" who ""tapped into a never-ending flow of women and money"". In his defence, his lawyer Marc Agnifilo told the court that no women were ever forced to do anything against their will. ""You may find him repulsive, disgusting and offensive. We don't convict people in this country for being repulsive or offensive,"" Agnifilo said. ""Unpopular ideas aren't criminal. Disgusting ideas aren't criminal."" A jury of eight men and four women dismissed his arguments, convicting Raniere for the catalogue of abuse, forced starvation and sexual exploitation he subjected his victims to. Raniere was at the top of this structure as the only man, but had a number of female deputies. Female recruits were allegedly branded with Raniere's initials and expected to have sex with him, as part of the system. Five female members of Nxivm - including a liquor heiress and an actress - have pleaded guilty to a series of charges for their involvement. The most high profile of these was former Smallville star Allison Mack. Smallville actress Allison Mack, reportedly a participant in the 'slave and master system' has already pleaded guilty to her involvement in Nxivm In April she pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges, despite previously denying the accusations. Mack admitted to recruiting women by telling them they were joining a female mentorship group. She is now scheduled to be sentenced in September and will face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the two charges. Clare Bronfman, the heir to the Seagram alcohol fortune, in April pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbour illegal immigrants for financial gain, and fraudulent use of identification. She was accused of pumping more than $100m (Â£77m) into Nxivm. In March, the co-founder of the group, Nancy Salzman, pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering. She is due to be sentenced in July. Lauren Salzman, the daughter of Nancy, and Nxivm employee, Kathy Russell, also pleaded guilty over their involvement. On its website Nxivm describes itself as a ""community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human"". Based in Albany, New York, the group was founded as Executive Success Programs in 1998. Billed as a personal development company, it claims to have worked with more than 16,000 people. Members of the group are reported to include wealthy socialites and Hollywood actresses. According to the group's website, it has suspended enrolment and events because of the ""extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time"".

"Boohoo's first recycled range will be made with reclaimed plastics ""If someone really cared about buying ethically sourced, green clothes then they wouldn't shop at Boohoo,"" shopper Camilla tells the BBC on Oxford Street. She is commenting on the fast fashion retailer's first recycled clothing range - made with reclaimed plastics - which was unveiled this week. The 22-year-old's view is not surprising, given the millions of low cost, fast fashion clothes that Boohoo sells every year. But while it's easy to dismiss the move as a marketing gimmick, Boohoo claims it is planning other green initiatives, and others have welcomed the new collection as a ""starting point"". ""It is good for people to try recycled clothes and see that they are just like normal clothes,"" says shopper Esme, 16. Could ditching 'fast fashion' make us happier? Ideas to make fashion more eco-friendly turned down ""I'm glad they are engaging because they are unlikely to change their supply chain overnight,"" adds Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion marketing at the University of Manchester. Boohoo says its34-piece range,externalis made with recycled polyester that had been destined for landfills and uses no environmentally unfriendly dyes or chemicals. The dresses, bodysuits, flares and crop tops have also been made entirely in the UK to cut air pollution. Zara is one of a growing number of retailers to launch recycled collections However, some have noted that the range was unveiled on the same day theEnvironmental Audit Committee (EAC) issued a critical reporton the fast fashion industry that mentioned Boohoo. The MPs warned companies were creating huge amounts of waste by selling cheap clothes designed only to be worn a few times. They also said the synthetic fabrics used to make such garments shed micro-fibres when washed, polluting waterways. ""The problem of clothing waste driven by rising volumes and lower prices in recent years are unlikely to be addressed by initiatives [like Boohoo's recycled range],"" says Stella Claxton of Nottingham Trent University, who gave evidence to the EAC. ""We know that too many garments that are disposed of through retailer take-back schemes or in charity collection bins will eventually find their way into landfill."" She also questions just how green Boohoo's recycled fabric will be, noting that even recycled polyester clothing can take hundreds of years to decompose. ""The garments are likely to shed microfibres into waterways when they're machine washed, just like the non recycled versions,"" she adds. In its report, the EAC made 18 proposals, including a 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes, and a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be recycled instead. But the government has said already it will adopt none of the policies. In that light, Dr Perry thinks Boohoo - and others retailers that have launched green clothing ranges - should be encouraged for doing so voluntarily. ""The real test will be if Boohoo can make this financially viable,"" she says. ""Because if they don't carry on then it will seem like a token gesture and them getting on the bandwagon."" Boohoo says it takes its environmental responsibilities ""extremely seriously"" and is encouraging its customers to wear its clothes for longer. ""We have also launched a further consumer awareness programme around washing at lower temperatures, and avoiding ironing and tumble drying where possible.""

"This video can not be played Remi Yeomans, two, attends a hospice which is facing closure in the West Midlands Children's hospices in England will be forced to cut services or shut unless the NHS increases its funding, a charity has warned. Together for Short Lives, which helps terminally ill children, highlighted a ""dangerous cocktail"" of higher costs and a drop in state funding. Its report examined funding for 27 of the 34 children's hospices in England. But NHS England said funding for children's end-of-life care was ""going up every year"". Cash-strapped children's hospice to close How hospices care for the terminally ill According to Together for Short Lives, children's hospices in England each spend an average of Â£3.7m per year - which works out as a total annual spend across the country of Â£125m. Their spending has increased by 4.5% since 2016/17, it said. But the percentage which the state contributes has fallen from 27% to 21% in five years, the report said - and hospices have been forced to use their reserve funds or stop services. One of the hospices, Acorns in Walsall, West Midlands,has said it will have to closelater this year unless it can raise more than Â£1.5m. If it closed, it would mean more than 200 children would lose vital support or be forced to travel long distances, and 70 jobs would be lost. Another hospice, Forget Me Not in West Yorkshire and north Manchester, said the lack of council and NHS funding ""has a huge impact"" on the care they can provide. ""We have two hospices: we cannot fully open our Bury hospice yet despite having amazing facilities and families desperate to access them because it receives no funding from the NHS,"" said chief executive Luen Thompson. ""Our Huddersfield hospice receives less than 3% in statutory funding of the Â£4 million it needs to run. ""Our offer to families shouldn't depend on how much we raise at a bucket collection or how much bric-a-brac we sell in one of our shops."" The hospice remembering children in birdsong How do you talk about dying to someone who is dying? The head of Together for Short Lives, Andy Fletcher, said the situation at Acorns could be ""just the tip of the iceberg"". ""It is simply not sustainable to expect specialist children's palliative care services provided by children's hospices to be funded by charity reserves and the generosity of the public,"" he said. The charity wants the NHS to increase the Children's Hospice Grant from Â£12m in 2019/20 to Â£25m per year. Mr Fletcher also said NHS funding was ""patchy"", with the research showing one hospice receiving 48% of its charitable expenditure from the state in the last financial year but another getting just 7%. And one in six hospices said they had received no funding from their local clinical commissioning groups in 2018/19. An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""NHS funding for children's end of life care is going up every year and is set to more than double within the next five years, with up to Â£25m going in to care as part of the NHS Long Term Plan. ""We are working with local health groups - including councils which of course have an important role to play in these services - and Together for Short Lives to provide the kind of support that children and their families want.""

"Alesha MacPhail was a pupil at Chapelside Primary in Airdrie Teachers and pupils at Alesha MacPhail's school have been celebrating her life ahead of the first anniversary of her murder. The six-year-old had just finished primary two when she was abducted and killed on the Isle of Bute last summer. Aaron Campbell, 16, was later sentenced to a minimum of 27 years after hefinally admittedhis crime. Wendy Davie, head of Chapelside Primary in Airdrie, said the happy, chatty youngster would never be forgotten. A large wooden playhouse inspired by the children's memories of Alesha and decorated with their pictures of unicorns and butterflies has been built in the school playground. Ms Davie said it was a lasting tribute to the child with an ""infectious smile"". The playhouse is decorated by pupils' artwork which was inspired by Alesha MacPhail The project was led by the children, who wanted a meeting place where they could make friends and have a chat. The head teacher is confident it would have won Alesha's seal of approval. She told BBC Scotland: ""She would want a place where she knows her friends can come and feel safe, and have a blether, and have giggle and play with slime, and draw and read books. ""She loved a good chat. She was always late for class in the morning because she would stay back at breakfast club to blether. ""She liked to get to know people and she was very, very caring towards everybody. She's sorely, sorely missed."" The playhouse is a space for the children to meet friends and 'have a blether' The playhouse was funded with Â£22,000 worth of donations from well-wishers from around the world following an online appeal. Ms Davie said it was important that pupils took ""ownership"" of the project. ""Death is a very difficult thing for young children,"" she said. ""This was a very child-friendly way in which they could say goodbye and they could incorporate all their ideas and all their memories into something that is going to be lasting here for others to see who didn't know Alesha. "" Head teacher Wendy Davie said Alesha had an ""infectious"" smile The children have also designed a special badge - a unicorn inside a pink heart - which they all wore at a special assembly on Thursday morning. Members of Alesha's family joined them to remember the schoolgirl in the service where pupils shared their memories and sang her favourite song - Light of Mine. The children also composed a version of the song Reach For The Stars and a specially-written poem incorporating the letters S,M,I,L,E was read out. Children and staff will wear a specially-designed badge in memory of Alesha Alesha was staying at her grandparents' flat on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay, when she was taken by Campbell in the early hours of 2 July last year. The child was then carried to a wooded area where she was raped and killed. A jury at the High Court in Glasgow later heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries, some of which were described by a pathologist as ""catastrophic."" A major search was launched the following morning but shortly before 09:00 an islander discovered Alesha's naked body near her killer's home in Ardbeg. Campbell was arrested on 4 July last year, two days after the murder Campbell was arrested two days later after his mother told police she had captured his odd movements on her home CCTV system. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Despite overwhelming forensic evidence the teenager, who gave evidence during his trial, repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed Alesha. Campbell told the High Court in Glasgow he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. But he later admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report for the court ahead of his sentencing. The bench is located in an area where children come to play Judge Lord Matthews said the background reports painted a picture of a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The school event will be followed next month by a fun day organised by Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane. The youngster has already been remembered on Bute with theunveiling of a pink memorial benchat the ""children's corner"" in Rothesay.

"The two leaders have never met in North Korea before China's President Xi Jinping has met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the first Chinese state visit to Pyongyang in 14 years. The leaders were expected to discuss economic issues and the stalled talks over North Korea's nuclear programme. It was their fifth meeting in 15 months, but the first to have taken place in North Korea. Both leaders are currently in separate disputes with the US - China over trade and North Korea over nuclear weapons. Who's sending aid to North Korea? North Korea crisis in 300 words Thursday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since a summit held by Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump ended in February without any agreement on denuclearisation. It also comes just a week before Mr Xi is set to meet the US president at the G20 summit in Japan. Thousands of people lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president to the country on Thursday morning, with video footage shared by Chinese state media showing crowds waving flowers and banners as his motorcade passed through Pyongyang. People lined the streets to welcome the Chinese president The leaders then held talks, in which Mr Xi praised Pyongyang's efforts towards denuclearisation and said he hoped that North Korea and the US could keep talking and make progress, according to Chinese media reports. Mr Xi's two-day visit is the first by any Chinese leader to North Korea in 14 years and his first since taking power in 2012. It is being seen as a boost for Mr Kim, who has been struggling to maintain momentum after a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year. The two leaders will inevitably discuss the stalled nuclear negotiations and the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Why N Korea called Biden an 'imbecile' What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Analysts say Mr Xi will want to know what happened and whether any way can be found to move things forward, information he could then share with Mr Trump in Japan. China wants North Korea to stop missile testing Although the visit was confirmed only earlier this week, Jenny Town, managing editor of US-based analysis site 38 North, says it is not a huge surprise that it is happening now, with the 70th anniversary of the two countries establishing diplomatic ties approaching. She says there might be some ""symbolic value"" in the visiting taking place just before the G20 summit, but that it's ""more of a bonus than a deciding factor"". China's main goal is stability in North Korea and economic co-operation, and ensuring that it remains a significant party in the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme. The two communist-led states are old allies. But ties have been strained over the past decade, with Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions viewed critically by Beijing. In June 2018, Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump met for the first time The official China Daily newspaper said on Wednesday that the visit would allow the two leaders to ""agree on some concrete co-operation projects"". And in a rare front page editorial in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Wednesday, Mr Xi reiterated his support for nuclear talks, saying: ""China supports North Korea for maintaining the right direction in resolving the issue of the Korean peninsula politically."" North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Everything about North Korea in nine charts In pictures: Growing up in North Korea The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers The visit will enable Mr Kim to show that he still has China's support, as other relationships are struggling. ""The North Koreans want to keep their friends close even if there isn't a lot of trust and a lot of goodwill between them,"" says Ms Town. This video can not be played North Korea has been called out for evading UN sanctions North Korea's economy is struggling under the international sanctions regime, put in place because of its repeated nuclear and missile tests. China, its biggest trading partner, has backed those sanctions but has indicated it would be in favour of some sanctions relief as an incentive for North Korea to denuclearise. ""China has proved to be the main destination for most of North Korea's exports, including minerals, fish, textiles, and also workers,"" North Korea analyst Peter Ward told the BBC. Beijing traditionally is also the main importer of goods for North Korea's industry and households. Under current sanctions, a lot of this trade has come to a halt. ""China would prefer to relax UN sanctions in these areas,"" Mr Ward says. ""It wants to ensure that North Korea's economy grows at a fair pace and that the North does not feel the need to test ballistic missiles and/or nuclear weapons again."" Given that sanctions are not likely to get lifted, there is little China can do. But Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told Reuters that Chinese economic support - possibly even China creating a ""hole"" in sanctions - would mean Mr Kim ""doesn't have to negotiate with the US from a position of weakness"". ""It can have both nuclear weapons and economic aid from China,"" he said.
