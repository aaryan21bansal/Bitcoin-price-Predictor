"This video can not be played On Friday the Met Office issued a red warning for extreme heat A national emergency has been declared after a red extreme heat warning was issued for the first time, as temperatures could hit 40C (104F). The Met Office's highest warning covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It means there is a risk to life and daily routines will need to change. Speed restrictions are likely on railway lines, some schools will close early and some hospital appointments will be cancelled. On the roads, gritters are planning to spread sand to reduce melting, and the RAC has warned more drivers will need help as cars overheat. On top of the Met Office warning, the UK Health Security Agency issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". NHS leaders on Friday evening warned there would be greater demand for ambulances and patients could be at risk if left outside hospitals in emergency vehicles in hot weather. In a letter they said ambulances should not wait outside emergency departments more than 30 minutes before offloading patients. Is the UK getting hotter? Schools prepare to close early How hot is it where you are? It is the first time a red heat warning has been issued for parts of the UK, although the extreme heat warning system was only introduced in 2021. Downing Street said the alert was being treated as a national emergency. Officials met on Friday and will meet again during the weekend to discuss the response. The weather at the start of next week is forecast to be warm across the UK but temperatures will be more like 30C in Scotland and Northern Ireland, rather than the high 30s predicted in parts of England and Wales. The heatwave - originating in north Africa - is spreading across Europe and has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said it was ""potentially a very serious situation"", with a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C - likely along the A1 corridor, running from London northwards towards Yorkshire and the North East. The highest recorded temperature in the UK was 38.7C in Cambridge in 2019 and BBC Weather presenter Matt Taylor said there is now a realistic possibility of hitting 40C in the UK. ""That is exceptionally hot, the sort of temperatures that if you are on holiday you may be able to deal with but in day-to-day life it can have severe impacts on health,"" he said. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Read more from James Gallagher here. Night-time temperatures in some areas will not drop below 25C but they are likely to start cooling off from Wednesday. Met Office CEO Penny Endersby said the extreme heat forecast was ""absolutely unprecedented"" and she urged people to take the warning as seriously as a red or amber warning for snow or wind. People in the UK are used to treating hot weather as a ""chance to go and play in the sun"" but ""this is not that sort of weather"", she said. In England, there were 2,500 excess deaths in the summer of 2020 due to hot weather, and the Red Cross predicts that heat-related deaths in the UK could treble in 30 years. This video can not be played Why is it so hot (in under 60 seconds)? People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the midday sun. There have been concerns aboutpressure on the NHSduring the extreme weather. Downing Street said contingency plans were in place and the prime minister was being updated. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. Seven of the top 10 hottest days in the UK have been since 2003, Mr Taylor said. 'The heat messes with my echolocation' Woman dies following paddleboard rescue The latest heatwave has brought warnings of disruption to travel with rail firm Avanti West Coast warning that weekend services might be cancelled at short notice, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. It said customers should only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" early next week. Network Rail said the impact to train services would ""vary by region, but journeys will take significantly longer and there is a likelihood of cancellations, delays and last-minute alterations"". Transport for London has also urged people in the capital to only travel for ""essential journeys"" - and warned there may be some impact to Tube and rail services. Meanwhile in sport, five horse race meetings have beencancelled on Monday and Tuesdaybecause of the forecast temperatures. How are you coping in the heat?

"Everyone aged 50 and over will be offered a Covid booster vaccine this autumn to top up their immunity and cut their risk of becoming severely ill. Younger people at high risk from Covid, as well as health and social care staff, will also get the booster. Drug companies have been developing updated vaccines to tackle newer variants, however, it is still uncertain which vaccine will be used. The original plan meant healthy people aged 50-65 would not have been jabbed. However, the immunisation campaign has been expanded as current variants are spreading quickly, it is uncertain how the virus will mutate and it is expected we will be more social this winter than in previous years so the virus will have more chance to spread. The updated advice comes from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It says the booster should be offered to: health and social care staff everyone aged 50 and over carers who are over the age of 16 people over five whose health puts them at greater risk, this includes pregnant women people over five who share a house with somebody with a weakened immune system The details of the rollout have not been confirmed, however, it is thought immunisation will start with the oldest and most vulnerable from September. For some people it will be their sixth dose of a Covid vaccine. Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the JCVI, said: ""The Covid-19 boosters are highly effective at increasing immunity and, by offering a further dose to those at higher risk of severe illness this autumn, we hope to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths over the winter."" The current wave of Covid - caused by the sub-variants of Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 - demonstrates the speed the virus can spread. It is the third wave of Omicron subvariants this year andone in 18 people in the UKare currently testing positive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Today we have confirmed the next phase in our booster programme to keep our defences strong over autumn and winter. ""Vaccines were our way out of this pandemic, and now they will make sure Covid can never haunt us in the same way again."" The flu vaccine in England will also be offered to all adults aged 50 and over, the usual high-risk groups and now to schoolchildren up to Year 9 in secondary school. The Covid restrictions have meant we have barely had a flu season since the pandemic started. However, the concern is this year could be the first time we face substantial waves of both viruses at the same time. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""Widening the eligibility for the flu vaccine will help reduce the number of people getting seriously ill and ease pressures on the NHS, particularly during the busy winter period.""

"President Biden was pictured fist-bumping the Saudi crown prince before their talks US President Joe Biden says he raised the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi during a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr Biden is in Saudi Arabia to rebuild relations, having previously promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record. He said he had made it clear the killing in 2018 was ""vitally important to me and the United States"". But he also said the two countries reached agreements on other issues. Mr Biden's visit has been criticised as validating the Saudi government following the murder of the US-based Saudi dissident journalist Khashoggi in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. What happened to Jamal Kashoggi? The striking picture that will define a visit Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was accused by US intelligence agencies of approving the murder. The prince has always denied the allegations, and Saudi prosecutors blamed ""rogue"" Saudi agents. Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents in 2018 ""With respect to the murder of Khashoggi, I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it at the time and what I think of it now,"" Mr Biden said in a press briefing after Friday's meeting. ""I said very straightforwardly, 'for an American president to be silent on an issue of human rights is inconsistent with who we are and who I am. I'll always stand up for our values'."" Mr Biden said the crown prince claimed he was ""not personally responsible"" for the death, the Associated Press reported. ""I indicated I thought he was,"" the president said he replied. Prior to the meeting Mr Biden was pictured fist-bumping the crown prince, indicating an apparent warming of relations between the two countries. But Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, criticised the president's actions. Tweeting a photo of the two men along with the words she imagined her fiancÃ© would have said, she wrote: ""Is this the accountability you promised for my murder? The blood of MBS's next victim is on your hands."" Meanwhile, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, Fred Ryan, said ""the fist bump between President Biden and Mohammed bin Salman was worse than a handshake - it was shameful. It projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking."" Khashoggi was a columnist for the Washington Post. Aside from Khashoggi's murder, President Biden said he and his Saudi counterpart had discussed energy and that he expected to see Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, take ""further steps"" to stabilise the market in the coming weeks. Defending Mr Biden's actions, US Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman told the BBC that Saudi Arabia increasing its supply of oil to the market would save lives. ""The price of oil means people die in poor countries. It raises the price of food and fertiliser and it means people die by the hundreds of thousands, not just from starvation but also from the disease the malnourished tend to acquire,"" he said. ""So it's very easy for Mrs Khashoggi [Hatice Cengiz] to say 'don't worry about those hundreds of thousands of people who will die, avenge my fiancÃ©e'. You've got to be adults here."" Mr Biden also announced Saudi Arabia would open its airspace to aircraft flying to and from Israel, which was previously banned. Why Biden's Saudi trip has proved so thorny Saudi prince 'approved Khashoggi killing' - US What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?

"Norman Butler, 60, was described as a ""true hero"" in a family tribute after his death The director of a recycling company has been jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of an employee who became trapped in machinery. Norman Butler, 60, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, died in November 2017 at Recycle Cymru in Kinmel Bay, Conwy county. Company director Stephen Jones, 60, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter. Jones's negligence ""was shockingly bad"", Mold Crown Court heard. ""You showed a criminal disregard for Norman Butler's life and limb and the whole responsibility for his untimely and unnecessary death falls on you,"" Mr Justice Griffiths told Jones during sentencing. ""You cut corners because you were motivated by financial gain,"" he added. ""It was an accident waiting to happen."" Boss guilty of trapped worker's machinery death Man died in machinery due to negligence - court Boss was sickened by worker's death, trial hears Mr Butler had been working as a van driver for the company for just a month before his death. The court previously heard Mr Butler fell into a baler used to compress waste cardboard into large cubes ready for recycling. Stephen Jones said he was 'sickened' to learn Norman Butler had died A computer animation by the Health and Safety Executive showed how employees were expected to hang from a rope above the baler while clearing blockages. Working alone, Mr Butler had walked up a conveyor before falling into the machinery. His body was found three hours later by a colleague. A pathologist told an inquest hearing the provisional cause of Mr Butler's death was massive blood loss. Jones ran his business ""without any regard for the safety of employees"", the court heard, ignoring warnings about health and safety failures and dangerous working on the site. Recycle Cymru, which went into liquidation this week, was also fined Â£120,000. A HSE computer animation showed ropes above the baler, for workers to hang on to remove any debris from the top of the baler with their feet. Mr Butler's family had personal statements read out in court on their behalf. His daughter Jessica Williams wrote ""My dad was a strong family man and for that to be taken away so suddenly well and truly broke me. ""Knowing he won't see his grandkids grow up and that I'll never see him smile or hear him laugh again or be able to hug him causes me such pain."" She added: ""I cry every time I think of him and read old text messages from him and think 'has this really happened?' I not only lost my dad but my best friend, he had a heart of gold."" Norman Butler's brother Joseph and niece Stacey attended the sentencing Mr Butler's brother Joseph wrote: ""Although this happened five years ago it still feels like yesterday, I will never get over it. ""I feel real anger when I think that my brother's death could have been prevented."" Outside court, Mr Butler read a statement, saying it had been a ""harrowing experience for all our family."" ""In our opinion, Mr Jones put all his employees at risk. Sadly for our family, it was Norman who lost his life.""

"Ceredigion, which is home to seaside town Aberystwyth, saw the third-steepest population decline in Wales and England Rural counties are in the grip of a ""brain drain"" that must be stopped, say politicians and academics. Ceredigion Senedd member Elin Jones saidnew census datais a wake-up call that demanded work to keep young people in constituencies like hers. The 2021 census revealed that since 2011, Ceredigion has seen a 28% drop in the number of 15 to 19-year-olds. Over that time, the number of 40 to 44-year-olds fell by 26%, the survey showed. The Welsh government said it was doing everything it could to ensure Wales is a country where people do not leave, and where young people can live, study and work in Wales. Costs drive young people back to their parents The fairy tale estate where you pay cheap rent Tough choices as rising living costs hit home Population of England and Wales up 6% in a decade Population falls occurred in schoolchildren, the working age population and young adults likely to be thinking of starting families. Across Wales there were reductions in these ages in other rural counties, but the falls in Ceredigion were greater. Seven areas saw total population falls, with the 5.8% drop in Ceredigion the third steepest in England and Wales. Ms Jones called on councils and the Welsh government to respond, and wants a conference focusing on the problem. She said: ""We are seeing the phenomenon of rural depopulation, especially amongst young people, continuing from the last century into the 21st Century. There's quite a significant decrease in the 15-24 age range in Ceredigion again."" Ms Jones, the Senedd member for Ceredigion said the issues that were causing young people to leave needed to be addressed in order to make the county sustainable She said job vacancies were going unfilled, including in the health and care sectors. ""We need young people in a community such as Ceredigion to make sure that it's sustainable in the long run,"" she said. ""So we need to address some of these issues that are causing it."" The county saw the number of 30 to 34-year-olds rise by 6%, but falls in 35 to 54-year-olds ranged from 3% to 26%. Ms Jones believed the best brains were needed to find what would make young people stay in Ceredigion. She said: ""It will require sustained effort, it will require actions - in the economy, in making rented housing and housing to purchase more affordable. ""But it also means that we need to do a bit of marketing about what does make Ceredigion a special place to live."" Cai said almost all of his old friends had left Beulah in Ceredigion Cai Ladd and Wyn Jones, both in their 30s, were raised in Beulah, Ceredigion, but now live and work away. Wyn is an architect in London and Cai an academic in Swansea. Cai said almost all of his old friends had left Beulah. ""That's a huge loss for the community,"" he said. Wyn now lives in London and said there is not a clear route for people to come back to the area once they have left Wyn said young people leave to find work and study, adding: ""There's a very clear route for people to leave to go for education, to go for work, but not a very clear route to come back."" Asked what would help, he said: ""Improved transport, business grants, certainly for people moving back early in their career. ""Improvements in the ability to buy houses. It's almost impossible to rent houses in west Wales."" The school in Beulah closed in 2019, the Post Office in the area has now closed too Meanwhile, the proportion of older people is growing, with a 17% increase in the number of those aged 65 and over in the county from 2011 to 2021. Across Wales there were 18% more people over 65 in 2021 than a decade earlier. Age Cymru Ceredigion president, Lyndon Lloyd, from Beulah, said ""The issue now is the polarisation between the higher rates of elderly who will need care, and the baseline in the county of young people who will go into the care service."" Young people leaving rural areas is not just a Welsh problem. In Italy, to attract new residents villageshave sold abandoned homes for â¬1and councils have offered to pay the rent of families who move and send a child to a local school. Prof Rhys Jones, of Aberystwyth University's geography department, said the census data showed a continuing and established pattern characterised by more old people in some parts of Wales. He said: ""There are different options. In certain states, there have been attempts to try and encourage young people, families to have more children. ""But there are also more radical options in terms of looking again at migration, at attracting people to come and work in certain parts of Wales to fill the gaps that exist in terms of different services and different sectors. ""Obviously, that is a contentious issue given that we've just come out of the whole Brexit process."" He agreed with Elin Jones that councils and the Welsh government needed to respond. ""They certainly need to plan proactively for a future in which there are potentially fewer people living in their local authority areas,"" Prof Jones said. ""And I think there needs to be some proactive planning in terms of the kinds of services that they need to supply in the future, the kinds of training that young people need in order to be able to go into different sectors, whether that's increasingly into care homes, into the health sector as well."" The census data was a wake-up call that demanded work to keep young people in places like Beulah in Ceredigion, said Senedd member Elin Jones A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Our focus is on increasing economic growth opportunities across the length and breadth of Wales, as part of our plans to create a more prosperous Welsh economy. ""We are tackling the issue of large numbers of second homes which can affect communities and their sustainability, and delivering 20,000 low-carbon homes for rent in the social sector over the course of this term of government and we're also taking action to create good jobs wherever people live."" A spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents Wales' local authorities, said: ""The nine local authorities that make up the WLGA Rural Forum are home to a third of the Welsh population who deserve equal consideration and opportunities to thrive. ""The Forum has called for a targeted rural youth programme to invest, upskill, attract and retain bright and talented young people in rural communities, and last year published a manifesto to reveal how to go about this. ""Another target in the manifesto is that housing will reflect local community needs, this includes tailored housing policies to support the needs of rural communities to stimulate local economies and retain a younger demographic, with capital subsidies to build affordable homes across a range of tenures and the identification of opportunities to explore cooperative housing in empty community properties.

"A woman stalked pop star Craig David and left him feeling ""violated"" in his own home, a court has heard. Tanya Jeal, 31, went to the singer's home, sent a letter to his family, and messaged his friends on social media. At Bromley Magistrates' Court in south-east London, Jeal admitted pursuing Mr David but said she was just an ""innocent fan"". However, she was given a stalking protection order banning her from contacting the musician for five years. In a witness impact statement read to the court by barrister Flora Curtis, Mr David said the incident ""left me feeling violated in my own home"". ""I want to be able to walk down the street without having to look over my shoulder,"" his statement said. What's the difference between a stalker and a super-fan? Ms Curtis said the pair met during an album signing at HMV in 2016, where the singer briefly spoke to Jeal before taking a photograph with her. She said their next interaction was later that year when Mr David was staying at Sofitel near Heathrow Airport. The pair took another photograph together before she was escorted off the premises by his security. Jeal, of Orpington, contended that the interaction took place in 2017. However, District Judge Kumar found her behaviour had amounted to acts associated with stalking. He imposed an order against Jeal, who represented herself in court, banning her from contacting the pop singer directly, indirectly or through third parties. She is also barred from contacting his parents directly or indirectly and is not allowed to go to any show or concert on a day where Mr David is performing.

"The five remaining Tory leadership candidates faced-off in the first TV debate of the contest Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat answered questions from an audience of ""floating voters"" Truss defended her plans for tax cuts - but Sunak said it's a ""fairy tale"" to ""borrow our way out of inflation"" Tugendhat said he was the only candidate not to vote for the recent national insurance rise Truss, Badenoch, and Mordaunt also faced questions on gender self-identification Tory MPs will have votes next week to whittle the candidates down to two - party members will decide the winner Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our politics live news coverage. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino, Aoife Walsh, Emma Owen, Jo Couzens and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Ben Tobias and Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here's a quick round-up of the main developments today. Here's a selection of the best quotes from each candidate during the televised debate earlier. We are all responsible for our own campaigns and I take it as a big fat compliment that no-one wants to run against me."" Penny Mordaunt on suggestions some of her rivals are trying to undermine her campaign I'm running an entirely positive campaign which is about the great challenges we face and what we need to do to deliver for the people of Britain because we are facing a cost-of-living crisis, families are struggling."" Liz Truss denies her campaign team has been attacking Mordaunt Energy is a subject that worries me a lot. I grew up in Nigeria where there were blackouts every single day, there still are. I know what it's like not to be able to turn on the light, so it terrifies me seeing how high bills are going."" Kemi Badenoch draws on her experience growing up when talking about addressing soaring energy bills It's easy to stand up to your enemies - it's sometimes harder to stand up to your friends."" Tom Tugendhat on the ministers who remained in Boris Johnson's government despite the controversies Borrowing your way out of inflation isn't a plan, it's a fairytale."" Rishi Sunak hits out at Truss's spending plans Earlier this evening, the first TV debate in the Conservative leadership contest saw the five remaining candidates grilled by the public and host Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Here's a summary of some of the key moments from the exchanges tonight: Trust Candidates were first asked a series of questions about whether
they should be trusted and how they can restore trust in voters following the controversies of Boris Johnson's government. Most cited their own record in
government and public life as evidence of their trustworthiness. Asked directly if Johnson is honest, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi
Sunak and Liz Truss did not give a yes or no answer, but acknowledged mistakes had been made. In more concise answers, Kemi Badenoch said
âsometimes"", while Tom Tugendhat said ""no"" - to a round of
applause from the audience. Gender self-identification for trans people Mordaunt was quizzed on her stance on trans issues and insisted she had never been in favour of self-identification, where a person could legally change their gender without, for example, a medical diagnosis. She also sought to draw a distinction between biological and trans women, saying transwomen could change gender legally ""but that does not mean they are identical to me"". Tax and economy Sunak portrayed himself as an economic realist who was willing to take the tough decisions that were needed. Truss said she would reverse increases in National Insurance and look to introduce low-tax zones across the country. Tugendhat said companies were more interested in investments than corporation tax cuts - a proposal mooted by other candidates. Mordaunt said she said
she'd halve VAT on fuel at the pump and had a plan for limited, timely,
targeted support. Energy Badenoch
and Truss both said they would remove green levies and Truss also said more
nuclear fuel was needed to counter costs. Tugendhat also said nuclear was the way forward, along
with better investment in home insulation. Sunak agreed, saying the long-term solution was improving
insulation in people's homes and getting people the support to pay for that. Mordaunt said energy companies were not passing savings
on to consumers and the standing charge on energy needed to be looked at. NHS Asked about how to deal with backlogs and health service
funding issues, Sunak said heâd already delivered on improving funding for the
NHS, despite the National Insurance hike coming at a great political cost to him personally. Badenoch
said the backlog was âterrifyingâ and explained sheâd been unable to get a
dental appointment for seven months to look at a chipped tooth. Mordaunt
said innovation was critical to reducing the backlog and argued there were many
levers the government can do to lower waiting lists Truss
said the government needed to work on improving rural services and expanding
access to GPs to reduce the pressure on hospitals. Tugendhat said improving leadership in government and the health services was key to
drive improvement in the NHS Green
economy Truss said she was committed to the 2050 net zero target as
did Sunak, who added that his daughters ask him what he'll do to fight climate
change. Mordaunt also said it was important to hit targets, but the government needed to be realistic about what it would take to get there. But Kemi Badenoch said while the UK needed to meet targets for climate
change, this should be done in a sustainable way that didn't damage the economy. Tugendhat
called for a global energy resilience plan. Tom Tugendhat was the winner of tonight's debate, according to asnap poll,externalfrom political research firm Opinium. More than one third of 1,000 voters asked to watch the debate said the backbench MP performed best, with former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in second. The full results are: Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Remember what tonight is all about. It's a chance for
candidates to speak to the public for the first time in a TV debate.
But crucially, they want to finish in the last two next week when Tory MPs
vote, so they then go into the vote of Tory members. Liz Truss will be happy she got into a meaty discussion with
Rishi Sunak on the economy. They disagree on how quickly tax cuts can be
brought in - and on whether it was right to put up National Insurance to fund
the NHS. Truss's team wants her to be seen as the genuine alternative to Sunak - and there are clear ideological differences on the economy for Tory MPs
to mull over. The other big clash tonight was on self-identification
for trans people. Penny Mordaunt has faced questions over her stance. She
set it out tonight; that legal changes to a person's identity can happen, but
biological differences will remain. She said she opposed changes when it comes
to sport and trans athletes. But Kemi Badenoch did not hold back, questioning Mordaunt's account of her position when she was minister for women and equalities. These debates can sometimes be a bit dull, with politicians
simply setting out what we already knew. Tonight was not; there are splits in
the Conservative Party and this race is getting heated. Delivering her closing comments, Penny Mordaunt said the contest needed to be about the general public. Credit: Britainâs Next PM: The C4 Debate/ITN Productions This video can not be played Returning to Liz Truss's closing remarks, she said the country faced grave challenges - an economic crisis, a war in Ukraine and decades of slow growth. She said she should be the next leader of the Tory party - and PM - because of her track record delivering policies across different departments. Now is not the time for the continuity of our current economic policy, Truss insisted. ""We need to cut taxes. We need to be bold."" She concluded by saying she could go into No 10 and on day one ""get the job done"" before she was cut off. And with that, the first leadership debate has ended. But stick with us for a while longer while we bring you reaction to the debate. Sunak says there is much agreement among the candidates, in that they all want to cut taxes, secure the borders and improve public services. He says addressing the crisis is about ""who can grip this moment and get things done"", adding that nothing that is worthwhile comes easy. Sunak adds the fundamental choice is over whether candidates confront challenges ""honestly and responsibly, or not"", adding for him ""there is only one answer"". Tom Tugendhat also thanks people for watching the debate. This is about you, your country and your PM, he says. The country is going through a crisis, he says, and we're seeing division and disunity around the world but we can turn this around. People tonight have been asking the right questions and we need a clean start, he says. ""I have a track record of leadership. I have led on operations and I have led in Parliament and now I would like to lead the United Kingdom,"" he finishes.  Penny Mordaunt says the leadership contest must be about the public, their lives and their worries. Mordaunt thanks viewers for watching the debate, saying she appreciates that the Conservative Party's decision to elect a new leader will have a direct impact on the audience's lives. She says she is not the traditional offer, not the legacy candidate. Mordaunt adds that she wants the UK to shine through and ""be all it can be"". The candidates are now setting out their closing remarks. Kemi Badenoch says it's time to tell the truth, otherwise ""we fail"". She says she loves this country and nothing would be more of an honour than being chosen to lead it. Badenoch adds she will fight as hard for other people's children as she would her own. We will do this with better government, she concludes, because the ""machine is not working"" at the moment. Tom Tugendhat says he wants an energy resilience plan for the whole world. He says it doesn't just work if we worry about the UK - the atmosphere doesn't care about that, it's all around the world.   Rishi Sunak says he's also committed to the pledge for net zero by 2050. He says his daughters don't care about his day job, other than asking what he's going to do to fight climate change, which means a lot to him. Sunak says we need to make sure we bring people with us, rather than going too hard or too fast on reducing emissions. Kemi Badenoch says the UK needs to meet targets for climate change in a sustainable way. She says emissions have already been reduced and we don't want to do further damage to our economy. We need to make decisions that don't harm everyday people, she says. Truss says she's committed to fighting climate change and better protecting wildlife and biodiversity in the UK. She says she would launch a new survey of wildlife to understand which species are endangered, if she becomes PM. Asked if she's committed to the pledge for net-zero emissions by 2050, she says she is. In the final question, the five candidates are asked about how they would go about creating a green economy. Tom Tugendhat says when his friends were injured in Afghanistan, they were cared for by the NHS and he thanks the service for that and says he'll always be grateful. He says he wants to drive leadership and efficiency into the NHS. These have been very difficult years during the Covid pandemic, he says, and he pays tribute to those who work in the NHS. Liz Truss says the government needs to work ""as hard as we can"" to reduce the backlog and expresses a particular need to support people in rural areas. She adds that GP services need to be more accessible in order to reduce the pressures on hospital services. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played On Friday the Met Office issued a red warning for extreme heat A national emergency has been declared after a red extreme heat warning was issued for the first time, as temperatures could hit 40C (104F). The Met Office's highest warning covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It means there is a risk to life and daily routines will need to change. Speed restrictions are likely on railway lines, some schools will close early and some hospital appointments will be cancelled. On the roads, gritters are planning to spread sand to reduce melting, and the RAC has warned more drivers will need help as cars overheat. On top of the Met Office warning, the UK Health Security Agency issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". NHS leaders on Friday evening warned there would be greater demand for ambulances and patients could be at risk if left outside hospitals in emergency vehicles in hot weather. In a letter they said ambulances should not wait outside emergency departments more than 30 minutes before offloading patients. Is the UK getting hotter? Schools prepare to close early How hot is it where you are? It is the first time a red heat warning has been issued for parts of the UK, although the extreme heat warning system was only introduced in 2021. Downing Street said the alert was being treated as a national emergency. Officials met on Friday and will meet again during the weekend to discuss the response. The weather at the start of next week is forecast to be warm across the UK but temperatures will be more like 30C in Scotland and Northern Ireland, rather than the high 30s predicted in parts of England and Wales. The heatwave - originating in north Africa - is spreading across Europe and has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said it was ""potentially a very serious situation"", with a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C - likely along the A1 corridor, running from London northwards towards Yorkshire and the North East. The highest recorded temperature in the UK was 38.7C in Cambridge in 2019 and BBC Weather presenter Matt Taylor said there is now a realistic possibility of hitting 40C in the UK. ""That is exceptionally hot, the sort of temperatures that if you are on holiday you may be able to deal with but in day-to-day life it can have severe impacts on health,"" he said. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Read more from James Gallagher here. Night-time temperatures in some areas will not drop below 25C but they are likely to start cooling off from Wednesday. Met Office CEO Penny Endersby said the extreme heat forecast was ""absolutely unprecedented"" and she urged people to take the warning as seriously as a red or amber warning for snow or wind. People in the UK are used to treating hot weather as a ""chance to go and play in the sun"" but ""this is not that sort of weather"", she said. In England, there were 2,500 excess deaths in the summer of 2020 due to hot weather, and the Red Cross predicts that heat-related deaths in the UK could treble in 30 years. This video can not be played Why is it so hot (in under 60 seconds)? People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the midday sun. There have been concerns aboutpressure on the NHSduring the extreme weather. Downing Street said contingency plans were in place and the prime minister was being updated. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. Seven of the top 10 hottest days in the UK have been since 2003, Mr Taylor said. 'The heat messes with my echolocation' Woman dies following paddleboard rescue The latest heatwave has brought warnings of disruption to travel with rail firm Avanti West Coast warning that weekend services might be cancelled at short notice, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. It said customers should only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" early next week. Network Rail said the impact to train services would ""vary by region, but journeys will take significantly longer and there is a likelihood of cancellations, delays and last-minute alterations"". Transport for London has also urged people in the capital to only travel for ""essential journeys"" - and warned there may be some impact to Tube and rail services. Meanwhile in sport, five horse race meetings have beencancelled on Monday and Tuesdaybecause of the forecast temperatures. How are you coping in the heat?

"The NHS is preparing for a surge in demand from people affected by rising temperatures in England and Wales. An extreme heat weather warning applies from Sunday to Tuesday as temperatures are due to peak in excess of 35C (95F) in south, central and east England. It means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness. Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the first line of defence was ""behavioural change"" and the key thing was to ""prepare"" government services. Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, he said it was critical that people look out for ""the most vulnerable groups"". Weather forecasts suggest mid to high-30s for the weekend but Mr Malthouse warned there was a ""smaller possibility that we could exceed that and possibly hit 40 which would be an all-time record"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The key thing we can do is prepare the government services for what may be a surge in demand - not least the health service and elsewhere"". Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Extreme weather warning extended to Tuesday Is the UK getting hotter? Temperatures in the wider area covered by the warning are more widely predicted to be as high as 35C, peaking on Tuesday, the Met Office said. Forecasters say they could be as high as 39C in parts of southern and eastern England. People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the sun in the middle of the day. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. The Met Office said the hot weather was caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe. A heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Pressures are already high onNHS services, with patients in England waiting longer for ambulances. Figures from June show that it took an average of 51 minutes for ambulances to respond to emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes - the target is 18. Emily Shuckburgh, professor of environmental data science at the University of Cambridge, described extreme heat as a ""silent killer"". More than 2,500 heat-related deaths were recorded in the summer of 2020, with the elderly especially vulnerable, she said. People are advised to find shade and avoid exposure to the sun during the middle of the day Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said older people who already struggle with significant health issues are ""going to find the coming heatwave a challenge"". She urged people to check on elderly relatives and friends during the high heat. Rail firm Avanti West Coast has warned of disrupted journeys over the coming days because of the extreme weather and staff shortages. It tweeted that services might be cancelled at short notice at the weekend, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. Network Rail said it was preparing the railway to keep passengers safe ""ahead of next week's very high temperatures"". Meanwhile, teachers' leaders fear schools may have to cancel sports days to protect students and staff during the heatwave. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said: ""It is extremely dangerous to take part in vigorous physical activity in extreme heat, with the risk of heat exhaustion and even heat stroke."" James Bowden, policy director for school leaders' union NAHT, also called on the government to ""give urgent thought"" to improving school buildings, saying poorly ventilated classrooms are ""inconducive to work"". In other developments: Runners in the Rabbit Run trail race in Bridgend county on Saturdayhave been advised to go slowlyamid concerns about extreme heat. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that the extreme heat and months of below average rainfall is causing concern. Richard Bramley from the NFU said the agriculture sector was ""way behind"" with water management and had not yet adapted to the changing climate. Hammersmith Bridge in west London, which was closed in 2020 due to a heatwave, has beenwrapped in giant pieces of foil to stop it from overheating. Plus, animals at a wildlife park in Oxfordshirehave been given frozen smoothiesmade from ingredients including pears and carrots to keep them cool.

"The Queen signed the visitor's book during a visit to officially open the new Thames Hospice building The Queen has made a surprise visit to a hospice with the Princess Royal to officially open its new centre. The monarch travelled from her Windsor Castle home to Maidenhead to tour the Thames Hospice to meet staff, volunteers and a patient. The hospice provides palliative and end-of-life care and support to people across East Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire. Its services are free for those who need care. More than 50% of its Â£13m annual running costs come from charitable support. Queen Elizabeth II stands with Jonathan Jones, chair of trustees, after unveiling a plaque The Queen's visit to the Â£22m centre - which features 28 private inpatient rooms - was not listed as an official engagement. Just as she was introduced to Graham White and his wife Pat, who has stage 4 cancer and is receiving respite care at the centre, his phone rang. The Queen quipped: ""Typical, a phone goes off immediately."" He sheepishly turned off his phone and said it was his son ringing. The Queen met patient Pat White during the visit Mrs White, from Sandhurst, Berkshire, chatted with the Queen and described the encounter as ""very emotional"", adding: ""This is a memory that I will treasure."" She joked about her husband's phone ringing, saying: ""I could have killed him. People think the Queen is all stiff upper lip but she has a sense of humour."" Mr White said: ""I turned my wife's phone off and I could have sworn mine was off - that was a bit embarrassing."" The former Windsor site of Thames Hospice was opened by the Queen in 1987 and past visitors have included Diana, Princess of Wales, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. On Tuesday, the Queen celebrated the achievements of the NHS across the decades by awarding the institution the George Crossduring a ceremony she hosted at Windsor. The 96-year-old head of state was joined by the Prince of Wales for the event, where health leaders from the four home nations were each awarded the medal.

"Owi hadn't considered how serious a sunburn can be A mother has warned parents to be careful when children are enjoying the hot weather, after her 10-year-old son was badly sunburnt. Rhian Wyn Lane said her son Owi was playing in a paddling pool and wearing sun cream all day. But when he woke up the next morning he was sick and had severe sunburn. On Friday anamber extreme heat weather warning,externalwas extended to all of Wales on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures of 38C (100F) forecast in parts.

Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke Keep children out of sun as heatwave hits - NHS Rhian, from Porthmadog, Gwynedd, said her children ""were in and out of the pool all day... they often put on sun cream, but it wasn't enough"". ""It doesn't matter what factor sun cream you put on, you can still get burned,"" she added. Five days later the burned skin turned into painful blisters. This video can not be played Owi says he was playing in a paddling pool during the day but woke in agony the next morning Owi said he did not think it was possible to burn ""so bad"" in a pool, and will wear a t-shirt when he is out in the sun in future. Rhian is now urging parents to be aware of the dangers of playing in the sun. She put photos of Owi's burnt skin on Facebook ""to remind people how important it is not just to put sun cream on, but to check the bottles"". Owi has been given an ointment to try to ease the ""mega painful"" sores Experts said children should be wearing sun cream that is at least factor 30 or higher.

The service's director of operations toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastactivity was up 10% during the last five days, compared to the cooler week before. Lee Brooks from Welsh Ambulance Service says people shoud enjoy the hot weather ""responsibly"" ""What makes us anxious is if you look back to July last year we had a heat wave back then as well the month resulted in a 17% uplift in activity compared to the July before,"" Lee Brooks said. ""So we are expecting a busy time."" Mr Brooks said there had been a notable rise in life-threatening emergencies related to breathing problems and chest pain. ""We absolutely want people to get the best time they can in our summer periodâ¦ but equally we want people to do that responsibly and not add to an already very pressured service.""

Great Western Railway (GWR) has issued a travel warning as heat-related speed restrictions across the region are set to affect train services. It also said trains will be busier and some journeys will be cancelled at short notice. Companies are telling passengers to bring extra water and plan their journeys Train journeys between Newport and Bristol Parkway on Sunday will be replaced by bus. GWR will therefore be allowing people with tickets for travel on its services on Monday and Tuesday to travel on Wednesday and Thursday instead. Customers who are delayed by 15 minutes may also be entitled to compensation. Meanwhile, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is releasing extra water into the River Wye to safeguard fish during the hot weather. NRW's operations manager, Ann Weedy, said long periods of dry weather could lead to low water levels in rivers, which can badly affect fish. Having less water causes overcrowding, leaving fish vulnerable to disease and predators. It also heightens the risk of algal blooms, which can lead to less oxygen in the water, killing more fish. Extra water will be released from the Caban Coch reservoir, pictured, to top up the River Wye ""The climate emergency is real, and we can expect to see more extreme events like this in the future,"" Ms Weedy said. The water release began on on Friday and will continue until Monday. The water is going from Caban Coch reservoir, in Powys, into the Afon Elan before feeding into the Wye.

"Everyone aged 50 and over in Northern Ireland will be offered a Covid booster vaccine this autumn to top up immunity and cut risks of serious illness. Younger people at high risk from Covid, as well as health and social care staff, will also be offered the booster. Updated vaccines have been developed to work better against newer variants. Health Minister Robin Swann said delivering the vaccine programme would be a ""major logistical operation"". The announcement comes following updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises health departments in the four UK nations. It says the booster should be offered to: health and social care staff everyone aged 50 and over carers who are over the age of 16 people over 5 whose health puts them at greater risk, this includes pregnant women people over 5 who share a house with somebody with a weakened immune system Mr Swann said the guidance meant health authorities could step up planning but did not provide details on the rollout or exactly when it is set to begin. He said: ""Vaccination is our chief defence against COVID-19 and I would again urge everyone who is eligible for a booster as part of our autumn programme to come forward as soon as it becomes available."" Mr Swann said he is confident the health service will be able to deliver the rollout ""despite all the pressures our service continues to face"". ""When we think back to where we were in 2020 before vaccines became available, we are reminded just how much we owe to all those who made our vaccine programme possible,"" he added.

"Daniel Hodgson Green was murdered by his mother Carol Hodgson in February A mother who murdered her two-year-old son the day she was due at an access hearing has been jailed for life. Daniel Hodgson Green was found suffocated next to his mother at home in Guisborough, Teesside, in February. Teesside Crown Court heard Carol Hodgson, 40, who admitted murder, tried to take her own life afterwards. Sentencing her for at least 18 years and four months, Judge Paul Watson said it had been a premeditated killing and not done ""in the heat of the moment"". He said Hodgson had deliberately killed Daniel and then tried to take her own life, which was only prevented when her own mother arrived at the house Upper Garth Gardens and raised the alarm. Despite pleading guilty, Hodgson has never revealed to police how her son died although experts believe he was suffocated. Forensic pathologist Dr Louise Mulcahy had told the court Daniel was likely to have been suffocated with a plastic bag from a vacuum cleaner, which was also found on the bed. Carol Hodgson had previously given no details about how her son died Hodgson had been due that day at a court hearing to discuss Daniel's father Stefan Green having increased contact with his son. Mr Green had been applying to have more access to his son and to stop Hodgson changing Daniel's surname, relocating or taking him on holiday without notifying him. The judge described the murder as ""a horrifying and truly awful crime"". The court heard emergency services arrived at Hodgson's home to find her mother performing CPR on her in her bedroom, with a paramedic then noticing Daniel lying lifeless next to his mother. Desperate attempts were made to save him at the scene and in hospital, but these were in vain. Hodgson's mother had found a note in the hallway of her daughter's home which told her to call the police and another on the bedroom door. Daniel's father Stefan Green told the court he had not seen his son since he was a baby as all contact had been cut off by his mother In a victim impact statement in court Daniel's father described how he only knew his son as a baby, before Hodgson had cut off all contact and ""disappeared with him"". Mr Green said Daniel had been his entire world and the shocking nature of his death had destroyed his and the rest of his family's lives, leaving him suffering PTSD and night terrors, struggling ""to find a way forward"". Speaking outside court Mr Green said: ""We never got to make a connection with my son, we never got to see his first steps or hear his first words and now because of an evil person, a person who should've been one of the two people he should've felt safest with, there is an entire lifetime of firsts lost."" Christopher Atkinson from the CPS and Det Insp Matt Hall said their thoughts were with Daniel's father Alistair MacDonald QC, prosecuting, said: ""It is no coincidence that she carried out the killing on the very morning the Family Court was due to hold a fact-finding hearing."" Det Insp Matt Hall, from Cleveland Police, said outside court Hodgson had offered police no explanation for her actions. ""She knew a long time in advance that was the day she was going to kill her son,"" he said. ""With no explanation offered she picked the date, she picked the method and she knew when her child woke up she was going to kill him in a selfish act."" Daniel was found at the house in Guisborough on 2 February Richard Wright QC, mitigating, said it was accepted by others Hodgson loved her son and had shown genuine remorse. ""The only explanation was she had developed a whole irrational and objectively unjustifiable but genuinely held belief that she was compelled to act as she did,"" he said. The judge said he could not imagine ""the pain and anguish"" Hodgson had caused to Daniel's father and others ""who loved and cherished him"". He added he accepted her actions that day ""were out of character"" and said although he believed Hodgson's remorse was genuine, he said ""given the level of premeditation"" it only carried ""marginal weight"". Christopher Atkinson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said he hoped the sentence would bring Daniel's father and family ""some measure of comfort"".

"Nadine Dorries is pushing for Channel 4 to be privatised Channel 4 has said an investigation has found no evidence to support claims by the culture secretary that parts of its show Tower Block of Commons were faked. The 2010 series featured MPs, including Nadine Dorries, spending time living in UK tower blocks and council estates. In May, Ms Dorries alleged that some people portrayed as living on her estate were actors and ""were not real"". Channel 4 said on Friday that its investigation had not ""revealed any evidence to support the allegations"". Two months ago, Ms Dorries told a House of Commons select committee that, after taking part in the documentary, she had ""later discovered that they [the people on the estate] were actually actors"". She said: ""The parents of some of the boys in that programme contacted me and came here to have lunch to tell me that the boys were in acting school. They were not really living in a flat - they were not real. They were actually actors. ""If you remember, there was a pharmacist I went to see who prepared food; she was also a paid actor as well."" In its statement on Friday, Channel 4 said it ""takes any allegations of misrepresentation extremely seriously and always rigorously investigates any such claims"". The broadcaster asked Love Productions, which made the series, to look into the claims. ""The investigation, overseen by their external lawyers, encompassed contributors who were ordinary members of the public and with whom the secretary of state had significant interaction,"" Channel 4 said. ""It involved speaking with many of those involved in the making of the series, including contributors and crew, and retrieving and reviewing relevant documentation and footage, including 85 hours of raw footage filmed for the series."" Channel 4 then reviewed Love Productions' findings and undertook its own ""internal document searches and review"", it said. ""Neither Love Productions' investigation nor Channel 4's internal inquiries revealed any evidence to support the allegations made about the programme."" Ms Dorries has not responded to Channel 4's findings. She was one of five MPs who agreed to spend a week on different estates while spending no more than Â£64.30 - a week's jobseekers' allowance at the time. Julian Knight MP, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he had asked for her comments ""as a matter of urgency"". The affair comes as Ms Dorries is at loggerheads with Channel 4 executives over her plans to privatise the broadcaster, which its bosses argue would be damaging. Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon told the select committee on Tuesday that Ms Dorries' government department had tried to rewrite a key part of the channel's annual report to downgrade its financial outlook. She said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had asked for changes to a statement in the report saying the company in its current form has a viable long-term financial future. The department ""made some comments that they would have preferred to see in the report, particularly about our future financial sustainability"", she said. ""One of the questions that government has raised in its consultation is whether Channel 4 is financially sustainable. And I think it is right to say that we have a difference of opinion about that. ""I have seen no independent or otherwise evidence to show that we are not in a future financially sustainable position."" What could privatising Channel 4 mean? Channel 4 makes privatisation alternative public Channel 4 didn't do itself any favours - Dorries The government has argued that privatisation makes sense because TV advertising revenues are declining (along with traditional TV viewing) and programme budgets are rising, so Channel 4 is being held back from competing with other TV services. The DCMS said the government, as Channel 4's owner, was ""fully entitled to comment on the contents of its annual report"", which could have been interpreted as going against a commitment ""to refrain from campaigning against privatisation"". The requested changes were not made, and the report was published in its original form on Friday. It said Channel 4 enjoyed its ""strongest ever financial performance"" in 2021/22, with corporate revenues of more than Â£1bn for the first time and a record pre-tax surplus of Â£101m. It also revealed that Ms Mahon's pay rose to Â£1.2m in the last financial year. Channel 4 defended the rise, saying executive salaries were ""benchmarked against, and broadly comparable to other commercial broadcasters in the UK"", and that it recognised ""Alex Mahon's leadership during a period of incredible creative and commercial success as well as significant uncertainty"".

"The five remaining Tory leadership candidates faced-off in the first TV debate of the contest Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat answered questions from an audience of ""floating voters"" Truss defended her plans for tax cuts - but Sunak said it's a ""fairy tale"" to ""borrow our way out of inflation"" Tugendhat said he was the only candidate not to vote for the recent national insurance rise Truss, Badenoch, and Mordaunt also faced questions on gender self-identification Tory MPs will have votes next week to whittle the candidates down to two - party members will decide the winner Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our politics live news coverage. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino, Aoife Walsh, Emma Owen, Jo Couzens and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Ben Tobias and Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here's a quick round-up of the main developments today. Here's a selection of the best quotes from each candidate during the televised debate earlier. We are all responsible for our own campaigns and I take it as a big fat compliment that no-one wants to run against me."" Penny Mordaunt on suggestions some of her rivals are trying to undermine her campaign I'm running an entirely positive campaign which is about the great challenges we face and what we need to do to deliver for the people of Britain because we are facing a cost-of-living crisis, families are struggling."" Liz Truss denies her campaign team has been attacking Mordaunt Energy is a subject that worries me a lot. I grew up in Nigeria where there were blackouts every single day, there still are. I know what it's like not to be able to turn on the light, so it terrifies me seeing how high bills are going."" Kemi Badenoch draws on her experience growing up when talking about addressing soaring energy bills It's easy to stand up to your enemies - it's sometimes harder to stand up to your friends."" Tom Tugendhat on the ministers who remained in Boris Johnson's government despite the controversies Borrowing your way out of inflation isn't a plan, it's a fairytale."" Rishi Sunak hits out at Truss's spending plans Earlier this evening, the first TV debate in the Conservative leadership contest saw the five remaining candidates grilled by the public and host Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Here's a summary of some of the key moments from the exchanges tonight: Trust Candidates were first asked a series of questions about whether
they should be trusted and how they can restore trust in voters following the controversies of Boris Johnson's government. Most cited their own record in
government and public life as evidence of their trustworthiness. Asked directly if Johnson is honest, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi
Sunak and Liz Truss did not give a yes or no answer, but acknowledged mistakes had been made. In more concise answers, Kemi Badenoch said
âsometimes"", while Tom Tugendhat said ""no"" - to a round of
applause from the audience. Gender self-identification for trans people Mordaunt was quizzed on her stance on trans issues and insisted she had never been in favour of self-identification, where a person could legally change their gender without, for example, a medical diagnosis. She also sought to draw a distinction between biological and trans women, saying transwomen could change gender legally ""but that does not mean they are identical to me"". Tax and economy Sunak portrayed himself as an economic realist who was willing to take the tough decisions that were needed. Truss said she would reverse increases in National Insurance and look to introduce low-tax zones across the country. Tugendhat said companies were more interested in investments than corporation tax cuts - a proposal mooted by other candidates. Mordaunt said she said
she'd halve VAT on fuel at the pump and had a plan for limited, timely,
targeted support. Energy Badenoch
and Truss both said they would remove green levies and Truss also said more
nuclear fuel was needed to counter costs. Tugendhat also said nuclear was the way forward, along
with better investment in home insulation. Sunak agreed, saying the long-term solution was improving
insulation in people's homes and getting people the support to pay for that. Mordaunt said energy companies were not passing savings
on to consumers and the standing charge on energy needed to be looked at. NHS Asked about how to deal with backlogs and health service
funding issues, Sunak said heâd already delivered on improving funding for the
NHS, despite the National Insurance hike coming at a great political cost to him personally. Badenoch
said the backlog was âterrifyingâ and explained sheâd been unable to get a
dental appointment for seven months to look at a chipped tooth. Mordaunt
said innovation was critical to reducing the backlog and argued there were many
levers the government can do to lower waiting lists Truss
said the government needed to work on improving rural services and expanding
access to GPs to reduce the pressure on hospitals. Tugendhat said improving leadership in government and the health services was key to
drive improvement in the NHS Green
economy Truss said she was committed to the 2050 net zero target as
did Sunak, who added that his daughters ask him what he'll do to fight climate
change. Mordaunt also said it was important to hit targets, but the government needed to be realistic about what it would take to get there. But Kemi Badenoch said while the UK needed to meet targets for climate
change, this should be done in a sustainable way that didn't damage the economy. Tugendhat
called for a global energy resilience plan. Tom Tugendhat was the winner of tonight's debate, according to asnap poll,externalfrom political research firm Opinium. More than one third of 1,000 voters asked to watch the debate said the backbench MP performed best, with former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in second. The full results are: Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Remember what tonight is all about. It's a chance for
candidates to speak to the public for the first time in a TV debate.
But crucially, they want to finish in the last two next week when Tory MPs
vote, so they then go into the vote of Tory members. Liz Truss will be happy she got into a meaty discussion with
Rishi Sunak on the economy. They disagree on how quickly tax cuts can be
brought in - and on whether it was right to put up National Insurance to fund
the NHS. Truss's team wants her to be seen as the genuine alternative to Sunak - and there are clear ideological differences on the economy for Tory MPs
to mull over. The other big clash tonight was on self-identification
for trans people. Penny Mordaunt has faced questions over her stance. She
set it out tonight; that legal changes to a person's identity can happen, but
biological differences will remain. She said she opposed changes when it comes
to sport and trans athletes. But Kemi Badenoch did not hold back, questioning Mordaunt's account of her position when she was minister for women and equalities. These debates can sometimes be a bit dull, with politicians
simply setting out what we already knew. Tonight was not; there are splits in
the Conservative Party and this race is getting heated. Delivering her closing comments, Penny Mordaunt said the contest needed to be about the general public. Credit: Britainâs Next PM: The C4 Debate/ITN Productions This video can not be played Returning to Liz Truss's closing remarks, she said the country faced grave challenges - an economic crisis, a war in Ukraine and decades of slow growth. She said she should be the next leader of the Tory party - and PM - because of her track record delivering policies across different departments. Now is not the time for the continuity of our current economic policy, Truss insisted. ""We need to cut taxes. We need to be bold."" She concluded by saying she could go into No 10 and on day one ""get the job done"" before she was cut off. And with that, the first leadership debate has ended. But stick with us for a while longer while we bring you reaction to the debate. Sunak says there is much agreement among the candidates, in that they all want to cut taxes, secure the borders and improve public services. He says addressing the crisis is about ""who can grip this moment and get things done"", adding that nothing that is worthwhile comes easy. Sunak adds the fundamental choice is over whether candidates confront challenges ""honestly and responsibly, or not"", adding for him ""there is only one answer"". Tom Tugendhat also thanks people for watching the debate. This is about you, your country and your PM, he says. The country is going through a crisis, he says, and we're seeing division and disunity around the world but we can turn this around. People tonight have been asking the right questions and we need a clean start, he says. ""I have a track record of leadership. I have led on operations and I have led in Parliament and now I would like to lead the United Kingdom,"" he finishes.  Penny Mordaunt says the leadership contest must be about the public, their lives and their worries. Mordaunt thanks viewers for watching the debate, saying she appreciates that the Conservative Party's decision to elect a new leader will have a direct impact on the audience's lives. She says she is not the traditional offer, not the legacy candidate. Mordaunt adds that she wants the UK to shine through and ""be all it can be"". The candidates are now setting out their closing remarks. Kemi Badenoch says it's time to tell the truth, otherwise ""we fail"". She says she loves this country and nothing would be more of an honour than being chosen to lead it. Badenoch adds she will fight as hard for other people's children as she would her own. We will do this with better government, she concludes, because the ""machine is not working"" at the moment. Tom Tugendhat says he wants an energy resilience plan for the whole world. He says it doesn't just work if we worry about the UK - the atmosphere doesn't care about that, it's all around the world.   Rishi Sunak says he's also committed to the pledge for net zero by 2050. He says his daughters don't care about his day job, other than asking what he's going to do to fight climate change, which means a lot to him. Sunak says we need to make sure we bring people with us, rather than going too hard or too fast on reducing emissions. Kemi Badenoch says the UK needs to meet targets for climate change in a sustainable way. She says emissions have already been reduced and we don't want to do further damage to our economy. We need to make decisions that don't harm everyday people, she says. Truss says she's committed to fighting climate change and better protecting wildlife and biodiversity in the UK. She says she would launch a new survey of wildlife to understand which species are endangered, if she becomes PM. Asked if she's committed to the pledge for net-zero emissions by 2050, she says she is. In the final question, the five candidates are asked about how they would go about creating a green economy. Tom Tugendhat says when his friends were injured in Afghanistan, they were cared for by the NHS and he thanks the service for that and says he'll always be grateful. He says he wants to drive leadership and efficiency into the NHS. These have been very difficult years during the Covid pandemic, he says, and he pays tribute to those who work in the NHS. Liz Truss says the government needs to work ""as hard as we can"" to reduce the backlog and expresses a particular need to support people in rural areas. She adds that GP services need to be more accessible in order to reduce the pressures on hospital services. Â© 2025 BBC.

She later said the comments were ""ill-timed"" and had been made after ""a rough day"", adding that the continuation of the show had meant she would be unable to pursue a passion project. Returning to the platform this week, she added: ""I felt awful about what I'd said and when a few DMs [direct messages] from a fellow Asian actress told me I'd become a blight on the Asian American community, I started feeling like I didn't even deserve to live any more.

"Daniel Hodgson Green was murdered by his mother Carol Hodgson in February A mother who murdered her two-year-old son the day she was due at an access hearing has been jailed for life. Daniel Hodgson Green was found suffocated next to his mother at home in Guisborough, Teesside, in February. Teesside Crown Court heard Carol Hodgson, 40, who admitted murder, tried to take her own life afterwards. Sentencing her for at least 18 years and four months, Judge Paul Watson said it had been a premeditated killing and not done ""in the heat of the moment"". He said Hodgson had deliberately killed Daniel and then tried to take her own life, which was only prevented when her own mother arrived at the house Upper Garth Gardens and raised the alarm. Despite pleading guilty, Hodgson has never revealed to police how her son died although experts believe he was suffocated. Forensic pathologist Dr Louise Mulcahy had told the court Daniel was likely to have been suffocated with a plastic bag from a vacuum cleaner, which was also found on the bed. Carol Hodgson had previously given no details about how her son died Hodgson had been due that day at a court hearing to discuss Daniel's father Stefan Green having increased contact with his son. Mr Green had been applying to have more access to his son and to stop Hodgson changing Daniel's surname, relocating or taking him on holiday without notifying him. The judge described the murder as ""a horrifying and truly awful crime"". The court heard emergency services arrived at Hodgson's home to find her mother performing CPR on her in her bedroom, with a paramedic then noticing Daniel lying lifeless next to his mother. Desperate attempts were made to save him at the scene and in hospital, but these were in vain. Hodgson's mother had found a note in the hallway of her daughter's home which told her to call the police and another on the bedroom door. Daniel's father Stefan Green told the court he had not seen his son since he was a baby as all contact had been cut off by his mother In a victim impact statement in court Daniel's father described how he only knew his son as a baby, before Hodgson had cut off all contact and ""disappeared with him"". Mr Green said Daniel had been his entire world and the shocking nature of his death had destroyed his and the rest of his family's lives, leaving him suffering PTSD and night terrors, struggling ""to find a way forward"". Speaking outside court Mr Green said: ""We never got to make a connection with my son, we never got to see his first steps or hear his first words and now because of an evil person, a person who should've been one of the two people he should've felt safest with, there is an entire lifetime of firsts lost."" Christopher Atkinson from the CPS and Det Insp Matt Hall said their thoughts were with Daniel's father Alistair MacDonald QC, prosecuting, said: ""It is no coincidence that she carried out the killing on the very morning the Family Court was due to hold a fact-finding hearing."" Det Insp Matt Hall, from Cleveland Police, said outside court Hodgson had offered police no explanation for her actions. ""She knew a long time in advance that was the day she was going to kill her son,"" he said. ""With no explanation offered she picked the date, she picked the method and she knew when her child woke up she was going to kill him in a selfish act."" Daniel was found at the house in Guisborough on 2 February Richard Wright QC, mitigating, said it was accepted by others Hodgson loved her son and had shown genuine remorse. ""The only explanation was she had developed a whole irrational and objectively unjustifiable but genuinely held belief that she was compelled to act as she did,"" he said. The judge said he could not imagine ""the pain and anguish"" Hodgson had caused to Daniel's father and others ""who loved and cherished him"". He added he accepted her actions that day ""were out of character"" and said although he believed Hodgson's remorse was genuine, he said ""given the level of premeditation"" it only carried ""marginal weight"". Christopher Atkinson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said he hoped the sentence would bring Daniel's father and family ""some measure of comfort"".

"Covid infections in the UK jump by 29% in a week, latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows Weekly coronavirus figures show 3.5 million cases were recorded in the week to 6 July, up from 2.7 million the week before One in 18 in the UK now has the virus, up from one in 25 the week before Two sub-variants of Omicron - called BA.4 and BA.5 - are driving new infections. Jabs are still offering strong protection against severe illness But rising Covid admissions, combined with staff sickness and the heatwave, are putting increasing strain on the NHS Nearly three million adults in England have still not come forward for a Covid vaccine, ONS data reveals Meanwhile a new fast-spreading variant BA.2.75 has been detected in India, UK, US, Australia, Germany and Canada Edited by Jeremy Gahagan We're going to close this live page soon but thanks for joining us. Here's a roundup of all the key events from today. New Covid statistics  New Omicron subvariant  Unvaccinated Britons told to get a jab  Read more on this storyhere. The live page writers were Jack Burgess, Sam Hancock and Thomas Mackinstosh. The editor was Jeremy Gahagan. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Some of you may be wondering what the difference is between a variant of Covid-19 and a sub-variant. Well, a virus must replicate to survive. As it makes copies of itself, some errors, changes or mutations can creep in because the duplication process isn't perfect. An offspring which is similar but not an exact copy of its parent is what we call a variant or a sub-variant, depending on the genetic changes it has undergone. Variants can behave slightly differently because of these mutations, which is why experts keep a close eye on them. Some new mutations can make it harder for the body's immune system to recognise the virus and fight it, for example. Omicron is actually a group of closely related variants and sub-variants that came from a common ancestor. The BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of Omicron that are spreading now can infect people even if they have had Covid in the past. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The Covid waves we've had this year have infected incredible numbers of people. Go back to January 2021 and the highest number of people infected in the ONS weekly surveys was 1.2 million. Already this year we've had a wave cap out at 4.9 million at the end of March and now one at 3.5 million and climbing. And yet we're seeing nowhere near the levels of severe illness. The number needing ventilation in intensive care went above3,700in England alone in January 2021. The equivalent figure now - in a much bigger wave - is just274. An estimated 107,600 people in Northern Ireland tested positive for Covid in the week ending 6 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The figure represents 5.86% of the population - half a percentage point higher than the previous week. The ONS said the figure was based on the percentage of people who tested positive using a recorded PCR test. Read more about Covid rates in Northern Ireland here. Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Coronavirus continues to have an impact overseas, and it's been reported that China's economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of this year as widespread lockdowns hit businesses and consumers. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.6% in the three months to the end of June from the previous quarter. Major cities across China, including the major financial and manufacturing centre Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period. This comes as the country continues to pursue its ""zero-Covid"" policy. You can read more aboutChina's shrinking economy here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News We have to get the idea that Covid is a seasonal virus out of our heads. This year we've had a wintery wave of the original Omicron, a spring wave of the Omicron sub-variant BA.2 and now a summer wave of sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. Remember there was a surge during the men's European Championship football tournament last summer too. In the long run the virus might settle down to be more like flu and strike in winter. But for now waves are being caused by fresh mutations in the virus rather than weather patterns. So will Covid be bad this autumn or winter? Well that depends on how the virus continues to evolve and whether the next round of boosters are any good at stopping it spreading. Of course the health service comes under intense strain every winter, so any additional pressure from Covid can only make that worse. This video can not be played Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos spent two months in a coma after having Covid Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos from Caister, Norfolk, spent two months in a coma after getting Covid. He was discharged from hospital in January and says he had suffered organ failures and a stroke - and was now ""fighting every day"" for his life. An intensive care doctor who looked after him has called for better support for people with long-term effects from the disease. Despite a spike in cases, the number of hospital patients in England testing positive for Covid appears to be slowing down. The rate of admissions stood at 17.9 per 100,000 people in the week ending 10 July, according to new figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This is up from 15.7 per 100,000 in the previous week - but marks the smallest rise for several weeks. ""Covid-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to rise, although the rate of increase appears to be slowing,"" Dr Mary Ramsay, UKHSA director of clinical programmes, says while urging those aged 75 and over to take up the offer of a spring booster. Covid hospital admission rates are highest in the West Midlands, according to the agency, with a rate of 24.45 per 100,000. Covid rates in Scotland have increased for the sixth week in a row, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Data for the week ending 7 July estimated that 1 in 16 people in Scotland would have tested positive for the virus. This was a slight increase from 1 in 17 the previous week, the ONS said. Cases are also continuing to increase across the UK, with 1 in 19 people in England estimated to have Covid last week, while the figure was 1 in 17 in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Read more about Covid rates in Scotland here. Top symptoms that could be Covid are a sore throat or a cough,
according to data from 17,500 people who said they had tested positive for the
virus this week. Other common ones reported were a headache and blocked nose. A high temperature or fever and loss of smell or taste - ones
which the NHS list high up as likely Covid symptoms - were far less common. A hoarse voice, sneezing, tiredness and muscle aches scored
higher. The top 10 Covid symptoms, in descending order, according to
the data from the Zoe App study are:  Read
more on the latest Covid variant symptoms here. Some comments to bring you from Sarah Crofts who is head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. She says: ""Infections are showing no signs of decreasing, with rates approaching levels last seen in March this year at the peak of the Omicron BA.2 wave. ""Rates have continued to increase across the UK and among all age groups. We will continue to closely monitor the data."" Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor I do not get any sense that governments in the UK are ready to impose new restrictions. There is a political aspect to it, and businesses need to have freedom to carry on doing things, such as the hospitality sector. But I am sure we will get more hints and stronger messages from public health authorities about mask wearing and face coverings in crowded public places on public transport. Not telling people to do it, but just advising people to be cautious if you're seeing somebody vulnerable. That seems to be the mood at the moment. Schools are going to be breaking up soon in England. They have already broken up in Scotland, and during school holidays there tends to be a bit of a fall off because it's less easy for the virus to transmit. People willremember in March - there was a lot of the virus aboutand it is spreading quite fast now. As we've seen, Covid cases have been rising rapidly in the UK in recent weeks. Despite this, nearly three million adults in England still havenât come forward
for a Covid vaccine, according to NHS England. Experts say the figure includes some people who could get
extremely sick if they were to catch the virus. Most elderly and vulnerable people have already had several
protective shots. But the parliamentary Public Accounts Committe has called for increased efforts to reduce the number of unvaccinated people. Getting fully immunised saves lives by cutting the risk of
severe Covid illness, although it cannot fully stop infections. Read more
on this story here. Around 3.5 million (3,498,700) people
in the UK had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July 2022, according to the
latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This is up
about 29% from around 2.7 million the week before. The ONS says that this is likely
caused by infections compatible with Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5. Thatâs about 5.4% of the population
(roughly one-in-18 people), up from roughly one-in-25 the week before. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It feels like an odd question to ask after another chunky rise in the number of people infected going from 2.7 million to 3.5 million. However, there are some postive signs if you read between the lines. Scotland has been ahead of the rest of the UK in this wave, however, study the charts and it looks like the number infected is slowing down and approaching the peak. Meanwhile, the number being admitted to hospital with Covid in England is also slowing down - another sign we could be approaching the peak. It's too early to know for sure, but the figures may start to look more positive in the coming weeks. Let's break down thelatest ONS coronavirus figures,externalto see how severe the situation really is. Scotland  England  Wales  Northern Ireland Some more now from the latest ONS survey. A total of 3.5 million people in private households are estimated to have had Covid last week, up 29% from 2.7 million the previous week. This is the highest estimate for total infections since mid-April, but is still below the record high of4.9 million that was reached at the end of March. We've just had the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It shows the rate of people testing positive for Covid has continued to rise across the UK. According to the fresh data, about 1 in 19 people were infected in England, while in Wales about 1 in 17 people would have had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July. Up until the same period at the start of the month in Northern Ireland the rate was about 1 in 17 and in Scotland the rate was about 1 in 16. Allow Twitter content?

We'll soon have the weekly latest UK Covid data from theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). The studies are carefully pieced together and today's coronavirus figures will come from a random selection of tens of thousands of people taking Covid tests, regardless of whether they had symptoms. The surveys estimate how much of the virus is around and act as a guide as to whether new regulations should be introduced. Covid vaccines modified to target new Covid variants could give better protection when used as a booster, the European Medicines Agency says. Pfizer and Moderna have already developed shots to target two types of Covid - the original one that started the pandemic, plus the Omicron variant called BA.1, which caused the massive wave of infection over the winter. Experts are looking to update the vaccine further to keep up with a virus that is changing or mutating. The US Food and Drug Administration has recommended manufacturers change the design of their booster shots to include components tailored to combat the new BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron that are behind rising infections now. The UK will announce its final plans for the autumn booster Covid vaccine programme nearer the time. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Judy Baker gave birth aged 18 and was pressured into giving up her baby for adoption Hundreds of thousands of unmarried women who were forced to give up their babies for adoption should receive a government apology, a report has said. The inquiry, by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, was set up following a series of reports by BBC News. It says 185,000 women in the 1950s, 60s and 70s were ""shamed"" and ""coerced"" into giving up their babies. Judy Baker, who was 18 when she gave birth in the 1960s, said she never got to say goodbye to her baby. Many women say they were denied pain relief during birth and were abused by social workers, nurses and other staff. The committee's report says the women were subjected to ""cruelty"", ""abuse"" and ""pressure"" - all for the purpose of getting them to hand over their babies for adoption. Many women were initially sent away to mother and baby homes, often run by churches, because their parents were so embarrassed by their pregnancy. The women ""were considered to have transgressed"" and had to be punished, the report said. Evidence was taken from around 300 people, mostly birth mothers and adopted children. Forced adoptions to be investigated by Parliament Mothers urged to talk to forced adoptions inquiry ""I'll never get over being forced to give up my baby"" Most of the mothers are now in their 70s or 80s, with the adopted people in their 40s and 50s. These witnesses spoke of the ""shame"" and ""secrecy"" that surrounded their pregnancy. During early medical appointments, the report says, the women were treated in a ""dismissive"" and ""cruel"" way. One woman told the inquiry: ""My (male) GP told me I was a social menace."" Adoption agencies, too, became involved at an early stage. One witness told the inquiry she ""was belittled and bullied into thinking I had only one option"", namely, to have her baby adopted. Some of the worst experiences came in hospital, when they went to give birth. Pat Tugwell was a schoolgirl when she became pregnant in 1964. She recalls going into labour, but being roughly handled by a nurse during an intimate examination. ""It was painful, it was painful,"" she told me. ""She looked at me and she said 'oh I don't know how you can get pregnant if you can't let me do this to you'. ""It was just such an awful thing to say. She would never have said it to anybody else who was married, so why did she say that to me just because I was unmarried? She obviously thought I was one of the lowest of the low."" Another woman was told by a nurse that she ""deserved all the pain I got"" during her delivery. A doctor said to another mother that ""I should be sterilised as I must be a nymphomaniac"". Many women told the committee they were not even allowed to hold their newborn baby. One wrote that ""they pulled her out of my armsâ¦ the pain was unbearable"". Another woman said: ""I screamedâ¦ and hung onto him like a woman possessed."" Other evidence detailed the trauma of handing babies over to social workers. Judy Baker, who was 18 when she gave birth in 1967, recalled being told to put her baby down in a room, turn around and leave. ""I never got to say goodbye,"" she said. ""I was just told I would get on with my life. It was as if it never happened. I had to wait 32 years before I could say 'hello' again. ""How can you do that to a teenager and to an innocent baby? How can you part them simply because I was unmarried? It was cruel, traumatic and should never have happened."" Chair of the committee, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said the affected women had ""suffered from shame and vilification and the burden of secrecy for decades"". ""The least the government can do is recognise that this shouldn't have happened then and it would never happen now, and it's right for the government to apologise."" Hundreds of birth mothers and adoptees have long campaigned for a government apology. Veronica, who was 24 when she was forced to give up her child, told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that such an apology would mean ""recognition that what had happened was so wrong, so wrong"". ""I felt very alone"", she said. Veronica was able to trace her daughter through an intermediary contact 25 years after the forced adoption, but her daughter ""really wasn't ready at the time"". Later on, Veronica met in 2004 with her daughter who had a child of her own by then. ""It was a lovely day"", Veronica added. This video can not be played Liz Harvie was taken from her birth mother, Yvonne, as a child Liz Harvie was born in 1974 after her mother was pressured to put her up for adoption. She says she has always had problems with her identity, but an apology would help. ""Some people say an apology, you know sorry, is just a small word, but I think really what lies behind the apology is the validation of all the pain and suffering that we have actually silently experienced. ""There's lots of shame, lots of guilt, there's lots of secrecy and being part of a secret society like this involved in forced adoptions has been extremely difficult for everyone involved."" Ms Baker said an apology was ""never, ever too late"". ""Sorry is so important and all of us out there are still living with the trauma and the pain that this has caused us. ""I've spent 50-plus years of my life, marked, scarred, by the trauma."" The committee concluded there are ""some things that only a government can do, and it falls on the government to make this apology"". In its response to the committee's conclusions, the government said: ""We have the deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. ""While we cannot undo the past, we have strengthened our legislation and practice to be built on empathy, from NHS maternity services caring for vulnerable women and babies, to our work transforming the adoption process and care system to help children settle into stable homes."" The committee also urged the government to provide better counselling services for birth mothers and adopted people. And it called for improved access to birth and medical records, saying there are often huge disparities in the timeliness of the responses of local authorities.

"Zarli Naing was a 27-year-old nurse helping the resistance At about 13:00 on 14 June, members of the volunteer People's Defence Force arrived at a patch of ground in the fields between two villages just west of the Chindwin River, in central Myanmar. They had been alerted by a cow herder, who had spotted crows picking at what he believed was a corpse. The volunteers saw a human hand protruding from the earth. It belonged to a young fighter from their group, Wu Khong, who had been injured and gone missing during an attack by the army four days earlier. With him, in the shallow grave, were four other bodies, dismembered and burned. From the clothing, a watch and a medical bag found nearby, they also identified 27-year-old Zarli Naing, a nurse who had come to this area in the Magway Region last year to provide healthcare to insurgents and locals. They were opposingMyanmar's military which had seized power on 1 February 2021, overthrowing the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Through interviews with Zarli Naing's friends and family, those who trained her, and the villagers and fighters she lived with until her death, the BBC has pieced together the story of a bright and courageous young woman whose decision to oppose the coup ended in tragedy. This is also the story of the desperate resistance being put up against the military junta by communities across a large swathe of the dry zone, an impoverished and drought-prone region of Myanmar. Zarli Naing was working in the rural and largely poor Magway Region, where the resistance is strong Zarli Naing was the youngest of four girls from a poor farming family, which lived close to the great temple complex of Bagan. The only one of them who did well at school, she went on to qualify as a nurse and got a job at a hospital in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. She was working there when the coup happened. Like thousands of other healthcare workers across the country, Zarli Naing joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM), refusing to work with the military-controlled administration. A month after the coup, she left Nay Pyi Taw and returned to her home village. But fearing her political activism would endanger her family, she decided to move on to a safe zone in the north of Magway, which is largely controlled by opposition forces such as the People's Defence Force or PDF. There she became part of an extensive underground healthcare network run by the thousands of doctors and nurses who have left their jobs in protest against the coup. She was also trying to complete an online degree course from the prestigious University of Nursing in Mandalay. She had started the programme in early 2020, but it was disrupted by the pandemic. ""When I spoke to her a month ago she told me how happy she was to be there,"" says one of her online supervisors, a nursing instructor for the clandestine network. ""She was especially happy that she could give first aid training to the PDF fighters in her area, because there are no other healthcare staff there. She was the only one able to give that service to them."" Aung San Suu Kyi, a Burmese icon, has a big following in Magway Region... and her arrest during the 2021 coup sparked huge protests in Myanmar Zarli Naing had spent the past 14 months in a village called Dan Bin Gan. She was invited there by a friend, Khin Hnin Wai, a teacher the same age as her, who was working at a school run by a respected head teacher, Win Kyaw. Win Kyaw was a prominent local CDM leader who backed the parallel National Unity Government, which was formed last year to challenge the military junta's rule. Dan Bin Gan was, in effect, a liberated zone. It had an active PDF wing, which had established its base in the centre of the village. Most of the 2,500 inhabitants are farmers, eking out a living from cultivating beans, sesame and groundnuts, and a little corn to feed their cattle. This part of Myanmar is known for being deeply loyal to Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, which, in the last election, won every seat in Magway in both the national and local parliaments. Opposition to the coup here, and in neighbouring southern Sagaing Region, is as strong as anywhere in Myanmar, with dozens of volunteer militias taking on the army using captured and home-made guns, and improvised mines. The village also lies just 6km (nearly 4 miles) from Sin Pyu Shin bridge, one of the only road crossings of the Chindwin River, and so vital for moving troops and other reinforcements around. Zarli Naing offered the only medical treatment for communities no longer able to use the local hospital, both because it was under military control, and also because after the coup so many nurses and doctors had abandoned state-run institutions. Friends and PDF fighters who knew her say she was deeply committed to the armed struggle, and ran first aid classes for the fighters. Those who knew Zarli Naing say she was passionate about her work and hopeful for Myanmar's future ""Zarli was very strong,"" says another of her supervisors, who is based in the UK, where some medics are providing support for the underground health network in Myanmar. ""She was always very upbeat. She never spoke about her own difficulties. She just asked smart questions when she needed to fix something. The clandestine health workers can get depressed by the challenges they face. ""Sometimes their patients cannot reach them because of roadblocks or fighting, and they cannot refer patients to hospitals if they need more complex surgery. That is very hard for them - many of their patients in that situation do not survive."" But Zarli Naing ""did not express any regret for the path she had chosen"", says a friend who worked near her in northern Magway. ""There were many times she missed her family. She never told them what she was doing. Knowing she was working for the CDM would have put them in danger. ""We used to ask people we knew for donations, to pay for the medicines we needed. We often used to speak together on the phone, and talk about the medical problems we faced, or about our support for the CDM."" From her Facebook page she seems to have been a keen reader, posting colourful covers of the Burmese novels she liked. The photos of herself that she shared show her either reading, or holding up her hand in the three-fingered symbol of defiance that has become so popular in South East Asia in recent years. One post has a series of pictures of a much younger Aung San Suu Kyi with her family back in the UK. The day before Zarli Naing died - 9 June - three PDF groups together launched an attack on the military post guarding the Sin Pyu Shin bridge, killing three soldiers and taking control of it for a few hours. A military counter-attack was inevitable, and in the early hours of 10 June, about 30 soldiers in four vehicles were spotted making for Dan Bin Gan from the east. Not all the soldiers were in uniform, but those that were could be identified by their shoulder badges as coming from infantry battalions 256, 257 and 258, based at Hpu Lon, near Yesagyo town about 25km to the south. At 03:00 the residents of Dan Bin Gan started fleeing the village, heading for open country to the west. Zarli Naing was among them. To slow the army down PDF fighters laid homemade mines along the road into Dan Bin Gan. One of them, Wu Khong, injured his leg in a fall while doing this. Zarli Naing stayed with him to treat his leg. Win Kyaw, who was protective of the young nurse, stayed back too. So did Zarli Naing's friend, Khin Hnin Wai, who was pregnant, and another young female fighter, Thae Ei Ei Win. They had run to the western edge of Dan Bin Gan, according to eyewitnesses, but had stopped for Zarli Naing to deal with Wu Khong's injury, when they were intercepted by a group of soldiers. Guided by an informer, the soldiers had come around the south of the village to avoid the mines. They captured Zarli Naing and her friends, tied their hands, and together with nine other people they had detained, began marching them north for about an hour to the village of Thit Gyi Taw. Eyewitnesses heard the soldiers asking their captives if they were members of the CDM, and warning that they could be jailed or shot. They say the soldiers repeatedly struck and kicked their captives; and stole food and alcohol from the now empty homes in the villages. According to PDF sources, they also set 70 houses in Thit Gyi Taw alight, sending up a large plume of black smoke over the fields. This video can not be played Watch: The young rebels fighting for democracy Later in the afternoon the captives were moved a little way south to a temple in a village called Peik Thit Kan. Nine of them were then released, the soldiers telling them to run for their lives. One of them told us the remaining five were still alive at that point. Exactly what happened to Zarli Naing and the other four prisoners after that is unclear. At some point in the night they were moved south of Peik Thit Kan, and killed by their captors. Some villagers have reported hearing them shouting for help. But it's not clear when and why their bodies were dismembered and burned. Local PDF fighters believe the military targeted Dan Bin Gan because it was a known centre of resistance to the coup, and also because of the school established there by Win Kyaw. The school had opened only in May, but had already attracted 250 students. Its success made it something of a showcase for the parallel administration which the National Unity Government is trying to run outside military-controlled zones. The PDF believes the informer travelling with the soldiers identified Win Kyaw, Zarli Naing and Khin Hnin Wai as important figures in Dan Bin Gan. Killing them has robbed the village and surrounding communities of leaders who helped to sustain the insurgency. Locals have built a memorial for Zarli Naing and the others who were killed that night It has also robbed Myanmar of a promising young nurse, in a country which, even before the disastrous military takeover, had one of Asia's poorest healthcare systems. ""I am sure she was a wonderful nurse,"" says her online instructor. ""She always tried so hard to do a good job. ""Just imagine, she was providing healthcare to the people of the village while all that time she was also taking all our online courses, even though there was no reliable internet access where she was. And she was taking the Bachelor degree course as well. The workload was enormous. ""Even I could not do all that. She was just wonderful. One of her teachers told me that her exam results were really good."" Zarli Naing had finished her first semester exams just two days before she died. At the time of writing, the inhabitants of Dan Bin Gan are still hiding in the forested area to the west of the village. It is the first time they have been forced to evacuate, but many other villages in this region have been attacked multiple times. This has repeatedly displaced their populations, creating serious humanitarian needs which are not being met because of the conflict and lack of access given to international agencies. Thousands of houses in northern Magway and southern Sagaing have been destroyed by the army; even when they feel safe enough to return, people do not have the resources to rebuild their homes. Last year's coup has unleashed a brutal war of attrition in this Burmese heartland, with uncountable casualties. Zarli Naing's story is just one of so many. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

"The five remaining Tory leadership candidates faced-off in the first TV debate of the contest Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat answered questions from an audience of ""floating voters"" Truss defended her plans for tax cuts - but Sunak said it's a ""fairy tale"" to ""borrow our way out of inflation"" Tugendhat said he was the only candidate not to vote for the recent national insurance rise Truss, Badenoch, and Mordaunt also faced questions on gender self-identification Tory MPs will have votes next week to whittle the candidates down to two - party members will decide the winner Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our politics live news coverage. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino, Aoife Walsh, Emma Owen, Jo Couzens and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Nathan Williams, Ben Tobias and Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here's a quick round-up of the main developments today. Here's a selection of the best quotes from each candidate during the televised debate earlier. We are all responsible for our own campaigns and I take it as a big fat compliment that no-one wants to run against me."" Penny Mordaunt on suggestions some of her rivals are trying to undermine her campaign I'm running an entirely positive campaign which is about the great challenges we face and what we need to do to deliver for the people of Britain because we are facing a cost-of-living crisis, families are struggling."" Liz Truss denies her campaign team has been attacking Mordaunt Energy is a subject that worries me a lot. I grew up in Nigeria where there were blackouts every single day, there still are. I know what it's like not to be able to turn on the light, so it terrifies me seeing how high bills are going."" Kemi Badenoch draws on her experience growing up when talking about addressing soaring energy bills It's easy to stand up to your enemies - it's sometimes harder to stand up to your friends."" Tom Tugendhat on the ministers who remained in Boris Johnson's government despite the controversies Borrowing your way out of inflation isn't a plan, it's a fairytale."" Rishi Sunak hits out at Truss's spending plans Earlier this evening, the first TV debate in the Conservative leadership contest saw the five remaining candidates grilled by the public and host Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Here's a summary of some of the key moments from the exchanges tonight: Trust Candidates were first asked a series of questions about whether
they should be trusted and how they can restore trust in voters following the controversies of Boris Johnson's government. Most cited their own record in
government and public life as evidence of their trustworthiness. Asked directly if Johnson is honest, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi
Sunak and Liz Truss did not give a yes or no answer, but acknowledged mistakes had been made. In more concise answers, Kemi Badenoch said
âsometimes"", while Tom Tugendhat said ""no"" - to a round of
applause from the audience. Gender self-identification for trans people Mordaunt was quizzed on her stance on trans issues and insisted she had never been in favour of self-identification, where a person could legally change their gender without, for example, a medical diagnosis. She also sought to draw a distinction between biological and trans women, saying transwomen could change gender legally ""but that does not mean they are identical to me"". Tax and economy Sunak portrayed himself as an economic realist who was willing to take the tough decisions that were needed. Truss said she would reverse increases in National Insurance and look to introduce low-tax zones across the country. Tugendhat said companies were more interested in investments than corporation tax cuts - a proposal mooted by other candidates. Mordaunt said she said
she'd halve VAT on fuel at the pump and had a plan for limited, timely,
targeted support. Energy Badenoch
and Truss both said they would remove green levies and Truss also said more
nuclear fuel was needed to counter costs. Tugendhat also said nuclear was the way forward, along
with better investment in home insulation. Sunak agreed, saying the long-term solution was improving
insulation in people's homes and getting people the support to pay for that. Mordaunt said energy companies were not passing savings
on to consumers and the standing charge on energy needed to be looked at. NHS Asked about how to deal with backlogs and health service
funding issues, Sunak said heâd already delivered on improving funding for the
NHS, despite the National Insurance hike coming at a great political cost to him personally. Badenoch
said the backlog was âterrifyingâ and explained sheâd been unable to get a
dental appointment for seven months to look at a chipped tooth. Mordaunt
said innovation was critical to reducing the backlog and argued there were many
levers the government can do to lower waiting lists Truss
said the government needed to work on improving rural services and expanding
access to GPs to reduce the pressure on hospitals. Tugendhat said improving leadership in government and the health services was key to
drive improvement in the NHS Green
economy Truss said she was committed to the 2050 net zero target as
did Sunak, who added that his daughters ask him what he'll do to fight climate
change. Mordaunt also said it was important to hit targets, but the government needed to be realistic about what it would take to get there. But Kemi Badenoch said while the UK needed to meet targets for climate
change, this should be done in a sustainable way that didn't damage the economy. Tugendhat
called for a global energy resilience plan. Tom Tugendhat was the winner of tonight's debate, according to asnap poll,externalfrom political research firm Opinium. More than one third of 1,000 voters asked to watch the debate said the backbench MP performed best, with former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in second. The full results are: Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Remember what tonight is all about. It's a chance for
candidates to speak to the public for the first time in a TV debate.
But crucially, they want to finish in the last two next week when Tory MPs
vote, so they then go into the vote of Tory members. Liz Truss will be happy she got into a meaty discussion with
Rishi Sunak on the economy. They disagree on how quickly tax cuts can be
brought in - and on whether it was right to put up National Insurance to fund
the NHS. Truss's team wants her to be seen as the genuine alternative to Sunak - and there are clear ideological differences on the economy for Tory MPs
to mull over. The other big clash tonight was on self-identification
for trans people. Penny Mordaunt has faced questions over her stance. She
set it out tonight; that legal changes to a person's identity can happen, but
biological differences will remain. She said she opposed changes when it comes
to sport and trans athletes. But Kemi Badenoch did not hold back, questioning Mordaunt's account of her position when she was minister for women and equalities. These debates can sometimes be a bit dull, with politicians
simply setting out what we already knew. Tonight was not; there are splits in
the Conservative Party and this race is getting heated. Delivering her closing comments, Penny Mordaunt said the contest needed to be about the general public. Credit: Britainâs Next PM: The C4 Debate/ITN Productions This video can not be played Returning to Liz Truss's closing remarks, she said the country faced grave challenges - an economic crisis, a war in Ukraine and decades of slow growth. She said she should be the next leader of the Tory party - and PM - because of her track record delivering policies across different departments. Now is not the time for the continuity of our current economic policy, Truss insisted. ""We need to cut taxes. We need to be bold."" She concluded by saying she could go into No 10 and on day one ""get the job done"" before she was cut off. And with that, the first leadership debate has ended. But stick with us for a while longer while we bring you reaction to the debate. Sunak says there is much agreement among the candidates, in that they all want to cut taxes, secure the borders and improve public services. He says addressing the crisis is about ""who can grip this moment and get things done"", adding that nothing that is worthwhile comes easy. Sunak adds the fundamental choice is over whether candidates confront challenges ""honestly and responsibly, or not"", adding for him ""there is only one answer"". Tom Tugendhat also thanks people for watching the debate. This is about you, your country and your PM, he says. The country is going through a crisis, he says, and we're seeing division and disunity around the world but we can turn this around. People tonight have been asking the right questions and we need a clean start, he says. ""I have a track record of leadership. I have led on operations and I have led in Parliament and now I would like to lead the United Kingdom,"" he finishes.  Penny Mordaunt says the leadership contest must be about the public, their lives and their worries. Mordaunt thanks viewers for watching the debate, saying she appreciates that the Conservative Party's decision to elect a new leader will have a direct impact on the audience's lives. She says she is not the traditional offer, not the legacy candidate. Mordaunt adds that she wants the UK to shine through and ""be all it can be"". The candidates are now setting out their closing remarks. Kemi Badenoch says it's time to tell the truth, otherwise ""we fail"". She says she loves this country and nothing would be more of an honour than being chosen to lead it. Badenoch adds she will fight as hard for other people's children as she would her own. We will do this with better government, she concludes, because the ""machine is not working"" at the moment. Tom Tugendhat says he wants an energy resilience plan for the whole world. He says it doesn't just work if we worry about the UK - the atmosphere doesn't care about that, it's all around the world.   Rishi Sunak says he's also committed to the pledge for net zero by 2050. He says his daughters don't care about his day job, other than asking what he's going to do to fight climate change, which means a lot to him. Sunak says we need to make sure we bring people with us, rather than going too hard or too fast on reducing emissions. Kemi Badenoch says the UK needs to meet targets for climate change in a sustainable way. She says emissions have already been reduced and we don't want to do further damage to our economy. We need to make decisions that don't harm everyday people, she says. Truss says she's committed to fighting climate change and better protecting wildlife and biodiversity in the UK. She says she would launch a new survey of wildlife to understand which species are endangered, if she becomes PM. Asked if she's committed to the pledge for net-zero emissions by 2050, she says she is. In the final question, the five candidates are asked about how they would go about creating a green economy. Tom Tugendhat says when his friends were injured in Afghanistan, they were cared for by the NHS and he thanks the service for that and says he'll always be grateful. He says he wants to drive leadership and efficiency into the NHS. These have been very difficult years during the Covid pandemic, he says, and he pays tribute to those who work in the NHS. Liz Truss says the government needs to work ""as hard as we can"" to reduce the backlog and expresses a particular need to support people in rural areas. She adds that GP services need to be more accessible in order to reduce the pressures on hospital services. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Backers of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have attacked Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they fight to stay in the race to succeed Boris Johnson. Former Brexit Minister Lord Frost said Ms Mordaunt did not ""master detail"" and ex-party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned her level of experience. Ms Mordaunt said rivals were trying to stop her as they did ""not want to run against me"" in a vote by Tory members. She also promised she would ""not engage"" in negative campaigning. Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak came first in Thursday's second round of voting by Conservative MPs for a new party leader and prime minister, with Ms Mordaunt second and Ms Truss third. The eliminated candidate, Attorney-General Suella Braverman, has given her backing to Ms Truss. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalLord Frost urged former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth on Thursday, to quit the race and support Ms Truss ""in return for a serious job"" in government. But Ms Badenoch's campaign said she had ""no intention of stepping down"" and was ""in it to win"". Chris Mason: TV debates can catapult or crush reputations Penny Mordaunt: Brexiteer and grassroots favourite Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor leading the pack Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Channel 4 will broadcast a debate at 19:30 BST between all the candidates, the first of two such events this weekend before the next round of MPs' voting on Monday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party did not ""fear any of the candidates"", accusing them of ""squabbling like cats in a bag"". With the Conservative leadership field now narrowed to five, the comments coming from the rival camps are becoming more bitter and personal. Lord Frost attacked Ms Mordaunt, who once served under him, telling Talk TV that she ""did not master the detail that was necessary"" and had been ""absent on parade"" during Brexit negotiations with the EU. Sir Iain questioned Trade Minister and former Defence Secretary Ms Mordaunt's suitability to be prime minister, telling LBC: ""We can't just elect somebody because for a short period of time they may look better than others."" Despite the name, Lord Frost has turned up the temperature in the leadership race. Initially allies of Liz Truss, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, were gunning for Rishi Sunak, dubbing him the ""high-tax chancellor"". But with Penny Mordaunt beating Ms Truss in to third place in the MPs' ballots so far, they are now taking aim at the former defence secretary. Essentially the charge is that she's too lazy and too ""woke"". But Lord Frost has exposed in public an aspect of leadership contests usually conducted in private. He is offering fourth-placed candidate Kemi Badenoch a deal - ""a serious job"" - if she drops out and backs Ms Truss. The Truss team says she herself isn't offering posts, but you can be assured that when all candidates try to build a coalition of support, they won't simply be relying on a policy platform to get fellow MPs to rally to their banner. And the Frost intervention also reveals a cold, hard reality. It's not clear at this stage who will make the final run-off. So you can expect the battle to become more brutal in the coming days. But Ms Mordaunt dismissed the criticisms of her, telling Sky News the reason she did not ""have a profile"" was that she had ""just been getting on with the job"" of being a minister prior to the Tory leadership contest. She said: ""People are obviously trying to stop me getting into the final [vote by party members] because they don't want to run against me... ""Having seen my polling and having seen how I would fare against them in the final round of this contest, it's understandable how they're trying to stop me."" Ms Mordaunt added: ""Anyone going for this job needs to be tested and scrutinised."" But she said her campaign was ""not engaging in any"" sniping. John Lamont, who is coordinating Ms Mordaunt's campaign in Scotland, called her an ""electoral asset"" and compared her to former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron, saying he had also not been well known by the public before becoming party leader. Meanwhile, Ms Braverman has written to her supporters urging them to back Ms Truss, arguing that Ms Badenoch would ""do a fantastic job as PM one day"" but did not have the backing to make it into the final two. There had been speculation that backbench MP Tom Tugendhat, who came fifth in Thursday's vote, might drop out of the contest. But in a tweet he said he would stay on and put his ""vision for Britain forward to the public"". Mr Sunak got 101 votes on Thursday, with Ms Mordaunt receiving 83 and Ms Truss 64. Ms Badenoch got 49 votes and Mr Tugendhat 32. The next round of voting takes place on Monday, as MPs whittle down the field to two, who will then face a postal ballot of Tory members to decide the winner. The final result will be announced on 5 September, when Mr Johnson will leave office. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM?

"People offered food to soldiers in Colombo to celebrate Mr Rajapaksa's departure Sri Lanka is seeking a way out of political and economic chaos after its President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned and fled the country. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as temporary leader on Friday and has the ruling party's backing to take the role permanently. This makes him the favourite when a new president is chosen next week, but may prove unacceptable to protesters. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore, sparking celebrations in the street. He and his family have been blamed for a deep economic crisis, with Sri Lankans facing acute shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Businesses and shops reopened in the capital, Colombo, on Friday morning after a curfew was lifted, but soldiers could still be seen on major roads. At the same time, thousands of people were back in long queues outside petrol stations. The process of parliament electing a new president began on Saturday, with MPs expected to take a vote on 20 July. The initial formal meeting lasted just 13 minutes, with a letter being read out from Mr Rajapaska defending his record. ""It is a matter of personal satisfaction for me that I was able to protect our people from the pandemic despite the economic crisis we were already facing,"" he wrote. According to news agency AFP, more than 16,500 people died during the pandemic in Sri Lanka, while the country's official foreign exchange reserves dropped from  $7.5bn (Â£6.3bn) to just $1m during his tenure. After being sworn in as interim leader, Mr Wickremesinghe promised to act quickly to put a democratically elected president in place. ""I will take immediate steps to establish the rule of law and peace in the country. I accept 100% the right to peaceful protests. But some are trying to do acts of sabotage,"" he said. Given the governing party has a majority, MPs are thought likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe, who has close links with the Rajapaksa family. But whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter, because Mr Wickremesinghe's resignation as PM was a key demand of protesters. Earlier this week, crowds stormed the former prime minister's compound, clashing with security forces. A demonstrator, Manuri Pabasari, told the BBC at the time that a protest rally against Ranil Wickremesinghe was expected in the coming days. ""He has no people's mandate [and] is a well known Rajapaksa supporter,"" she added. ""I mean the new president and the new prime minister should be not a Rajapaksa supporter."" Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Meanwhile, Singapore says ousted president Rajapaksa did not ask for political asylum when he arrived there. The former president, who arrived with his wife and two bodyguards, no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. He is expected to stay in Singapore for some time before possibly moving to the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lankan security sources told AFP news agency. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"Covid infections in the UK jump by 29% in a week, latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows Weekly coronavirus figures show 3.5 million cases were recorded in the week to 6 July, up from 2.7 million the week before One in 18 in the UK now has the virus, up from one in 25 the week before Two sub-variants of Omicron - called BA.4 and BA.5 - are driving new infections. Jabs are still offering strong protection against severe illness But rising Covid admissions, combined with staff sickness and the heatwave, are putting increasing strain on the NHS Nearly three million adults in England have still not come forward for a Covid vaccine, ONS data reveals Meanwhile a new fast-spreading variant BA.2.75 has been detected in India, UK, US, Australia, Germany and Canada Edited by Jeremy Gahagan We're going to close this live page soon but thanks for joining us.

The live page writers were Jack Burgess, Sam Hancock and Thomas Mackinstosh. The editor was Jeremy Gahagan. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Some of you may be wondering what the difference is between a variant of Covid-19 and a sub-variant. Well, a virus must replicate to survive. As it makes copies of itself, some errors, changes or mutations can creep in because the duplication process isn't perfect. An offspring which is similar but not an exact copy of its parent is what we call a variant or a sub-variant, depending on the genetic changes it has undergone. Variants can behave slightly differently because of these mutations, which is why experts keep a close eye on them. Some new mutations can make it harder for the body's immune system to recognise the virus and fight it, for example. Omicron is actually a group of closely related variants and sub-variants that came from a common ancestor. The BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of Omicron that are spreading now can infect people even if they have had Covid in the past. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The Covid waves we've had this year have infected incredible numbers of people. Go back to January 2021 and the highest number of people infected in the ONS weekly surveys was 1.2 million. Already this year we've had a wave cap out at 4.9 million at the end of March and now one at 3.5 million and climbing. And yet we're seeing nowhere near the levels of severe illness. The number needing ventilation in intensive care went above3,700in England alone in January 2021. The equivalent figure now - in a much bigger wave - is just274. An estimated 107,600 people in Northern Ireland tested positive for Covid in the week ending 6 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The figure represents 5.86% of the population - half a percentage point higher than the previous week. The ONS said the figure was based on the percentage of people who tested positive using a recorded PCR test. Read more about Covid rates in Northern Ireland here. Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Coronavirus continues to have an impact overseas, and it's been reported that China's economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of this year as widespread lockdowns hit businesses and consumers. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.6% in the three months to the end of June from the previous quarter. Major cities across China, including the major financial and manufacturing centre Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period. This comes as the country continues to pursue its ""zero-Covid"" policy. You can read more aboutChina's shrinking economy here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News We have to get the idea that Covid is a seasonal virus out of our heads. This year we've had a wintery wave of the original Omicron, a spring wave of the Omicron sub-variant BA.2 and now a summer wave of sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. Remember there was a surge during the men's European Championship football tournament last summer too. In the long run the virus might settle down to be more like flu and strike in winter. But for now waves are being caused by fresh mutations in the virus rather than weather patterns. So will Covid be bad this autumn or winter? Well that depends on how the virus continues to evolve and whether the next round of boosters are any good at stopping it spreading. Of course the health service comes under intense strain every winter, so any additional pressure from Covid can only make that worse. This video can not be played Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos spent two months in a coma after having Covid Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos from Caister, Norfolk, spent two months in a coma after getting Covid. He was discharged from hospital in January and says he had suffered organ failures and a stroke - and was now ""fighting every day"" for his life. An intensive care doctor who looked after him has called for better support for people with long-term effects from the disease. Despite a spike in cases, the number of hospital patients in England testing positive for Covid appears to be slowing down. The rate of admissions stood at 17.9 per 100,000 people in the week ending 10 July, according to new figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This is up from 15.7 per 100,000 in the previous week - but marks the smallest rise for several weeks. ""Covid-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to rise, although the rate of increase appears to be slowing,"" Dr Mary Ramsay, UKHSA director of clinical programmes, says while urging those aged 75 and over to take up the offer of a spring booster. Covid hospital admission rates are highest in the West Midlands, according to the agency, with a rate of 24.45 per 100,000. Covid rates in Scotland have increased for the sixth week in a row, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Data for the week ending 7 July estimated that 1 in 16 people in Scotland would have tested positive for the virus. This was a slight increase from 1 in 17 the previous week, the ONS said. Cases are also continuing to increase across the UK, with 1 in 19 people in England estimated to have Covid last week, while the figure was 1 in 17 in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Read more about Covid rates in Scotland here. Top symptoms that could be Covid are a sore throat or a cough,
according to data from 17,500 people who said they had tested positive for the
virus this week. Other common ones reported were a headache and blocked nose. A high temperature or fever and loss of smell or taste - ones
which the NHS list high up as likely Covid symptoms - were far less common. A hoarse voice, sneezing, tiredness and muscle aches scored
higher. The top 10 Covid symptoms, in descending order, according to
the data from the Zoe App study are:  Read
more on the latest Covid variant symptoms here. Some comments to bring you from Sarah Crofts who is head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. She says: ""Infections are showing no signs of decreasing, with rates approaching levels last seen in March this year at the peak of the Omicron BA.2 wave. ""Rates have continued to increase across the UK and among all age groups. We will continue to closely monitor the data."" Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor I do not get any sense that governments in the UK are ready to impose new restrictions. There is a political aspect to it, and businesses need to have freedom to carry on doing things, such as the hospitality sector. But I am sure we will get more hints and stronger messages from public health authorities about mask wearing and face coverings in crowded public places on public transport. Not telling people to do it, but just advising people to be cautious if you're seeing somebody vulnerable. That seems to be the mood at the moment. Schools are going to be breaking up soon in England. They have already broken up in Scotland, and during school holidays there tends to be a bit of a fall off because it's less easy for the virus to transmit. People willremember in March - there was a lot of the virus aboutand it is spreading quite fast now. As we've seen, Covid cases have been rising rapidly in the UK in recent weeks. Despite this, nearly three million adults in England still havenât come forward
for a Covid vaccine, according to NHS England. Experts say the figure includes some people who could get
extremely sick if they were to catch the virus. Most elderly and vulnerable people have already had several
protective shots. But the parliamentary Public Accounts Committe has called for increased efforts to reduce the number of unvaccinated people. Getting fully immunised saves lives by cutting the risk of
severe Covid illness, although it cannot fully stop infections. Read more
on this story here. Around 3.5 million (3,498,700) people
in the UK had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July 2022, according to the
latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This is up
about 29% from around 2.7 million the week before. The ONS says that this is likely
caused by infections compatible with Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5. Thatâs about 5.4% of the population
(roughly one-in-18 people), up from roughly one-in-25 the week before. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It feels like an odd question to ask after another chunky rise in the number of people infected going from 2.7 million to 3.5 million. However, there are some postive signs if you read between the lines. Scotland has been ahead of the rest of the UK in this wave, however, study the charts and it looks like the number infected is slowing down and approaching the peak. Meanwhile, the number being admitted to hospital with Covid in England is also slowing down - another sign we could be approaching the peak. It's too early to know for sure, but the figures may start to look more positive in the coming weeks. Let's break down thelatest ONS coronavirus figures,externalto see how severe the situation really is. Scotland  England  Wales  Northern Ireland Some more now from the latest ONS survey. A total of 3.5 million people in private households are estimated to have had Covid last week, up 29% from 2.7 million the previous week. This is the highest estimate for total infections since mid-April, but is still below the record high of4.9 million that was reached at the end of March. We've just had the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It shows the rate of people testing positive for Covid has continued to rise across the UK. According to the fresh data, about 1 in 19 people were infected in England, while in Wales about 1 in 17 people would have had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July. Up until the same period at the start of the month in Northern Ireland the rate was about 1 in 17 and in Scotland the rate was about 1 in 16. Allow Twitter content?

The studies are carefully pieced together and today's coronavirus figures will come from a random selection of tens of thousands of people taking Covid tests, regardless of whether they had symptoms. The surveys estimate how much of the virus is around and act as a guide as to whether new regulations should be introduced. Covid vaccines modified to target new Covid variants could give better protection when used as a booster, the European Medicines Agency says. Pfizer and Moderna have already developed shots to target two types of Covid - the original one that started the pandemic, plus the Omicron variant called BA.1, which caused the massive wave of infection over the winter. Experts are looking to update the vaccine further to keep up with a virus that is changing or mutating. The US Food and Drug Administration has recommended manufacturers change the design of their booster shots to include components tailored to combat the new BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron that are behind rising infections now. The UK will announce its final plans for the autumn booster Covid vaccine programme nearer the time. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Zarli Naing was a 27-year-old nurse helping the resistance At about 13:00 on 14 June, members of the volunteer People's Defence Force arrived at a patch of ground in the fields between two villages just west of the Chindwin River, in central Myanmar. They had been alerted by a cow herder, who had spotted crows picking at what he believed was a corpse. The volunteers saw a human hand protruding from the earth. It belonged to a young fighter from their group, Wu Khong, who had been injured and gone missing during an attack by the army four days earlier. With him, in the shallow grave, were four other bodies, dismembered and burned. From the clothing, a watch and a medical bag found nearby, they also identified 27-year-old Zarli Naing, a nurse who had come to this area in the Magway Region last year to provide healthcare to insurgents and locals. They were opposingMyanmar's military which had seized power on 1 February 2021, overthrowing the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Through interviews with Zarli Naing's friends and family, those who trained her, and the villagers and fighters she lived with until her death, the BBC has pieced together the story of a bright and courageous young woman whose decision to oppose the coup ended in tragedy. This is also the story of the desperate resistance being put up against the military junta by communities across a large swathe of the dry zone, an impoverished and drought-prone region of Myanmar. Zarli Naing was working in the rural and largely poor Magway Region, where the resistance is strong Zarli Naing was the youngest of four girls from a poor farming family, which lived close to the great temple complex of Bagan. The only one of them who did well at school, she went on to qualify as a nurse and got a job at a hospital in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. She was working there when the coup happened. Like thousands of other healthcare workers across the country, Zarli Naing joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM), refusing to work with the military-controlled administration. A month after the coup, she left Nay Pyi Taw and returned to her home village. But fearing her political activism would endanger her family, she decided to move on to a safe zone in the north of Magway, which is largely controlled by opposition forces such as the People's Defence Force or PDF. There she became part of an extensive underground healthcare network run by the thousands of doctors and nurses who have left their jobs in protest against the coup. She was also trying to complete an online degree course from the prestigious University of Nursing in Mandalay. She had started the programme in early 2020, but it was disrupted by the pandemic. ""When I spoke to her a month ago she told me how happy she was to be there,"" says one of her online supervisors, a nursing instructor for the clandestine network. ""She was especially happy that she could give first aid training to the PDF fighters in her area, because there are no other healthcare staff there. She was the only one able to give that service to them."" Aung San Suu Kyi, a Burmese icon, has a big following in Magway Region... and her arrest during the 2021 coup sparked huge protests in Myanmar Zarli Naing had spent the past 14 months in a village called Dan Bin Gan. She was invited there by a friend, Khin Hnin Wai, a teacher the same age as her, who was working at a school run by a respected head teacher, Win Kyaw. Win Kyaw was a prominent local CDM leader who backed the parallel National Unity Government, which was formed last year to challenge the military junta's rule. Dan Bin Gan was, in effect, a liberated zone. It had an active PDF wing, which had established its base in the centre of the village. Most of the 2,500 inhabitants are farmers, eking out a living from cultivating beans, sesame and groundnuts, and a little corn to feed their cattle. This part of Myanmar is known for being deeply loyal to Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, which, in the last election, won every seat in Magway in both the national and local parliaments. Opposition to the coup here, and in neighbouring southern Sagaing Region, is as strong as anywhere in Myanmar, with dozens of volunteer militias taking on the army using captured and home-made guns, and improvised mines. The village also lies just 6km (nearly 4 miles) from Sin Pyu Shin bridge, one of the only road crossings of the Chindwin River, and so vital for moving troops and other reinforcements around. Zarli Naing offered the only medical treatment for communities no longer able to use the local hospital, both because it was under military control, and also because after the coup so many nurses and doctors had abandoned state-run institutions. Friends and PDF fighters who knew her say she was deeply committed to the armed struggle, and ran first aid classes for the fighters. Those who knew Zarli Naing say she was passionate about her work and hopeful for Myanmar's future ""Zarli was very strong,"" says another of her supervisors, who is based in the UK, where some medics are providing support for the underground health network in Myanmar. ""She was always very upbeat. She never spoke about her own difficulties. She just asked smart questions when she needed to fix something. The clandestine health workers can get depressed by the challenges they face. ""Sometimes their patients cannot reach them because of roadblocks or fighting, and they cannot refer patients to hospitals if they need more complex surgery. That is very hard for them - many of their patients in that situation do not survive."" But Zarli Naing ""did not express any regret for the path she had chosen"", says a friend who worked near her in northern Magway. ""There were many times she missed her family. She never told them what she was doing. Knowing she was working for the CDM would have put them in danger. ""We used to ask people we knew for donations, to pay for the medicines we needed. We often used to speak together on the phone, and talk about the medical problems we faced, or about our support for the CDM."" From her Facebook page she seems to have been a keen reader, posting colourful covers of the Burmese novels she liked. The photos of herself that she shared show her either reading, or holding up her hand in the three-fingered symbol of defiance that has become so popular in South East Asia in recent years. One post has a series of pictures of a much younger Aung San Suu Kyi with her family back in the UK. The day before Zarli Naing died - 9 June - three PDF groups together launched an attack on the military post guarding the Sin Pyu Shin bridge, killing three soldiers and taking control of it for a few hours. A military counter-attack was inevitable, and in the early hours of 10 June, about 30 soldiers in four vehicles were spotted making for Dan Bin Gan from the east. Not all the soldiers were in uniform, but those that were could be identified by their shoulder badges as coming from infantry battalions 256, 257 and 258, based at Hpu Lon, near Yesagyo town about 25km to the south. At 03:00 the residents of Dan Bin Gan started fleeing the village, heading for open country to the west. Zarli Naing was among them. To slow the army down PDF fighters laid homemade mines along the road into Dan Bin Gan. One of them, Wu Khong, injured his leg in a fall while doing this. Zarli Naing stayed with him to treat his leg. Win Kyaw, who was protective of the young nurse, stayed back too. So did Zarli Naing's friend, Khin Hnin Wai, who was pregnant, and another young female fighter, Thae Ei Ei Win. They had run to the western edge of Dan Bin Gan, according to eyewitnesses, but had stopped for Zarli Naing to deal with Wu Khong's injury, when they were intercepted by a group of soldiers. Guided by an informer, the soldiers had come around the south of the village to avoid the mines. They captured Zarli Naing and her friends, tied their hands, and together with nine other people they had detained, began marching them north for about an hour to the village of Thit Gyi Taw. Eyewitnesses heard the soldiers asking their captives if they were members of the CDM, and warning that they could be jailed or shot. They say the soldiers repeatedly struck and kicked their captives; and stole food and alcohol from the now empty homes in the villages. According to PDF sources, they also set 70 houses in Thit Gyi Taw alight, sending up a large plume of black smoke over the fields. This video can not be played Watch: The young rebels fighting for democracy Later in the afternoon the captives were moved a little way south to a temple in a village called Peik Thit Kan. Nine of them were then released, the soldiers telling them to run for their lives. One of them told us the remaining five were still alive at that point. Exactly what happened to Zarli Naing and the other four prisoners after that is unclear. At some point in the night they were moved south of Peik Thit Kan, and killed by their captors. Some villagers have reported hearing them shouting for help. But it's not clear when and why their bodies were dismembered and burned. Local PDF fighters believe the military targeted Dan Bin Gan because it was a known centre of resistance to the coup, and also because of the school established there by Win Kyaw. The school had opened only in May, but had already attracted 250 students. Its success made it something of a showcase for the parallel administration which the National Unity Government is trying to run outside military-controlled zones. The PDF believes the informer travelling with the soldiers identified Win Kyaw, Zarli Naing and Khin Hnin Wai as important figures in Dan Bin Gan. Killing them has robbed the village and surrounding communities of leaders who helped to sustain the insurgency. Locals have built a memorial for Zarli Naing and the others who were killed that night It has also robbed Myanmar of a promising young nurse, in a country which, even before the disastrous military takeover, had one of Asia's poorest healthcare systems. ""I am sure she was a wonderful nurse,"" says her online instructor. ""She always tried so hard to do a good job. ""Just imagine, she was providing healthcare to the people of the village while all that time she was also taking all our online courses, even though there was no reliable internet access where she was. And she was taking the Bachelor degree course as well. The workload was enormous. ""Even I could not do all that. She was just wonderful. One of her teachers told me that her exam results were really good."" Zarli Naing had finished her first semester exams just two days before she died. At the time of writing, the inhabitants of Dan Bin Gan are still hiding in the forested area to the west of the village. It is the first time they have been forced to evacuate, but many other villages in this region have been attacked multiple times. This has repeatedly displaced their populations, creating serious humanitarian needs which are not being met because of the conflict and lack of access given to international agencies. Thousands of houses in northern Magway and southern Sagaing have been destroyed by the army; even when they feel safe enough to return, people do not have the resources to rebuild their homes. Last year's coup has unleashed a brutal war of attrition in this Burmese heartland, with uncountable casualties. Zarli Naing's story is just one of so many. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

Lee Brooks from Welsh Ambulance Service says people shoud enjoy the hot weather ""responsibly"" ""What makes us anxious is if you look back to July last year we had a heat wave back then as well the month resulted in a 17% uplift in activity compared to the July before,"" Lee Brooks said. ""So we are expecting a busy time."" Mr Brooks said there had been a notable rise in life-threatening emergencies related to breathing problems and chest pain.

""Obviously we advise people to not spend the entire time outside in the heat but to come inside to cool down too. There'll be plenty of water here."" Great Western Railway (GWR) has issued a travel warning as heat-related speed restrictions across the region are set to affect train services. It also said trains will be busier and some journeys will be cancelled at short notice. Companies are telling passengers to bring extra water and plan their journeys Train journeys between Newport and Bristol Parkway on Sunday will be replaced by bus. GWR will therefore be allowing people with tickets for travel on its services on Monday and Tuesday to travel on Wednesday and Thursday instead. Customers who are delayed by 15 minutes may also be entitled to compensation. Meanwhile, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is releasing extra water into the River Wye to safeguard fish during the hot weather. NRW's operations manager, Ann Weedy, said long periods of dry weather could lead to low water levels in rivers, which can badly affect fish. Having less water causes overcrowding, leaving fish vulnerable to disease and predators. It also heightens the risk of algal blooms, which can lead to less oxygen in the water, killing more fish. Extra water will be released from the Caban Coch reservoir, pictured, to top up the River Wye ""The climate emergency is real, and we can expect to see more extreme events like this in the future,"" Ms Weedy said. The water release began on on Friday and will continue until Monday. The water is going from Caban Coch reservoir, in Powys, into the Afon Elan before feeding into the Wye.

"Adam Price said he wants the discussion to look ""forward"" and set a long term strategy Plaid Cymru members are being asked for ideas for the party's future. The consultation will cover a range of topics including independence, Europe, and political cooperation. Plaid came third in the 2021 Senedd election, behind Labour and the Welsh Conservatives, but gained control of three extra councils in May's local elections. Leader Adam Price said he wanted the discussion to ""look forward"" and set a long-term strategy. Plaid Cymru struck a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government on a variety of policies including expanding free school meals, a bigger Senedd and a council tax revaluation. Plaid failing to challenge Drakeford, say Tories Labour-Plaid deal 'will change thousands of lives' Plaid's Adam Price could face Senedd questions The party's key goal of Welsh independence will be part of the discussion, with members asked to contribute their thoughts on issues like time scales and effective routes to get there. With changes planned for UK and Welsh parliaments' constituencies before the next set of elections, the consultation will also ask about changes to the Plaid's organisational structure. In the introduction to the document, Mr Price wrote: ""If we are to succeed in convincing our fellow citizens to support our vision and persuade them to join us in realising it, we need that vision to be clear among ourselves, and understand the strategic choices we will have to make to most effectively achieve our goals. ""That means we need to discuss, debate and decide democratically the best way forward for our party in the years ahead."" The consultation will take place over the summer and be discussed at Plaid's autumn conference.

The live page writers were Jack Burgess, Sam Hancock and Thomas Mackinstosh. The editor was Jeremy Gahagan. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Some of you may be wondering what the difference is between a variant of Covid-19 and a sub-variant. Well, a virus must replicate to survive. As it makes copies of itself, some errors, changes or mutations can creep in because the duplication process isn't perfect. An offspring which is similar but not an exact copy of its parent is what we call a variant or a sub-variant, depending on the genetic changes it has undergone. Variants can behave slightly differently because of these mutations, which is why experts keep a close eye on them. Some new mutations can make it harder for the body's immune system to recognise the virus and fight it, for example. Omicron is actually a group of closely related variants and sub-variants that came from a common ancestor. The BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of Omicron that are spreading now can infect people even if they have had Covid in the past. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The Covid waves we've had this year have infected incredible numbers of people. Go back to January 2021 and the highest number of people infected in the ONS weekly surveys was 1.2 million. Already this year we've had a wave cap out at 4.9 million at the end of March and now one at 3.5 million and climbing. And yet we're seeing nowhere near the levels of severe illness. The number needing ventilation in intensive care went above3,700in England alone in January 2021. The equivalent figure now - in a much bigger wave - is just274. An estimated 107,600 people in Northern Ireland tested positive for Covid in the week ending 6 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The figure represents 5.86% of the population - half a percentage point higher than the previous week. The ONS said the figure was based on the percentage of people who tested positive using a recorded PCR test. Read more about Covid rates in Northern Ireland here. Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Coronavirus continues to have an impact overseas, and it's been reported that China's economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of this year as widespread lockdowns hit businesses and consumers. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.6% in the three months to the end of June from the previous quarter. Major cities across China, including the major financial and manufacturing centre Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period. This comes as the country continues to pursue its ""zero-Covid"" policy. You can read more aboutChina's shrinking economy here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News We have to get the idea that Covid is a seasonal virus out of our heads. This year we've had a wintery wave of the original Omicron, a spring wave of the Omicron sub-variant BA.2 and now a summer wave of sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. Remember there was a surge during the men's European Championship football tournament last summer too. In the long run the virus might settle down to be more like flu and strike in winter. But for now waves are being caused by fresh mutations in the virus rather than weather patterns. So will Covid be bad this autumn or winter? Well that depends on how the virus continues to evolve and whether the next round of boosters are any good at stopping it spreading. Of course the health service comes under intense strain every winter, so any additional pressure from Covid can only make that worse. This video can not be played Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos spent two months in a coma after having Covid Konstantinos Kanatsaropoulos from Caister, Norfolk, spent two months in a coma after getting Covid. He was discharged from hospital in January and says he had suffered organ failures and a stroke - and was now ""fighting every day"" for his life. An intensive care doctor who looked after him has called for better support for people with long-term effects from the disease. Despite a spike in cases, the number of hospital patients in England testing positive for Covid appears to be slowing down. The rate of admissions stood at 17.9 per 100,000 people in the week ending 10 July, according to new figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This is up from 15.7 per 100,000 in the previous week - but marks the smallest rise for several weeks. ""Covid-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to rise, although the rate of increase appears to be slowing,"" Dr Mary Ramsay, UKHSA director of clinical programmes, says while urging those aged 75 and over to take up the offer of a spring booster. Covid hospital admission rates are highest in the West Midlands, according to the agency, with a rate of 24.45 per 100,000. Covid rates in Scotland have increased for the sixth week in a row, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Data for the week ending 7 July estimated that 1 in 16 people in Scotland would have tested positive for the virus. This was a slight increase from 1 in 17 the previous week, the ONS said. Cases are also continuing to increase across the UK, with 1 in 19 people in England estimated to have Covid last week, while the figure was 1 in 17 in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Read more about Covid rates in Scotland here. Top symptoms that could be Covid are a sore throat or a cough,
according to data from 17,500 people who said they had tested positive for the
virus this week. Other common ones reported were a headache and blocked nose. A high temperature or fever and loss of smell or taste - ones
which the NHS list high up as likely Covid symptoms - were far less common. A hoarse voice, sneezing, tiredness and muscle aches scored
higher. The top 10 Covid symptoms, in descending order, according to

more on the latest Covid variant symptoms here. Some comments to bring you from Sarah Crofts who is head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. She says: ""Infections are showing no signs of decreasing, with rates approaching levels last seen in March this year at the peak of the Omicron BA.2 wave. ""Rates have continued to increase across the UK and among all age groups. We will continue to closely monitor the data."" Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor I do not get any sense that governments in the UK are ready to impose new restrictions. There is a political aspect to it, and businesses need to have freedom to carry on doing things, such as the hospitality sector. But I am sure we will get more hints and stronger messages from public health authorities about mask wearing and face coverings in crowded public places on public transport. Not telling people to do it, but just advising people to be cautious if you're seeing somebody vulnerable. That seems to be the mood at the moment. Schools are going to be breaking up soon in England. They have already broken up in Scotland, and during school holidays there tends to be a bit of a fall off because it's less easy for the virus to transmit. People willremember in March - there was a lot of the virus aboutand it is spreading quite fast now. As we've seen, Covid cases have been rising rapidly in the UK in recent weeks. Despite this, nearly three million adults in England still havenât come forward
for a Covid vaccine, according to NHS England. Experts say the figure includes some people who could get
extremely sick if they were to catch the virus. Most elderly and vulnerable people have already had several
protective shots. But the parliamentary Public Accounts Committe has called for increased efforts to reduce the number of unvaccinated people. Getting fully immunised saves lives by cutting the risk of
severe Covid illness, although it cannot fully stop infections. Read more

in the UK had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July 2022, according to the
latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This is up
about 29% from around 2.7 million the week before. The ONS says that this is likely
caused by infections compatible with Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5. Thatâs about 5.4% of the population
(roughly one-in-18 people), up from roughly one-in-25 the week before. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It feels like an odd question to ask after another chunky rise in the number of people infected going from 2.7 million to 3.5 million. However, there are some postive signs if you read between the lines. Scotland has been ahead of the rest of the UK in this wave, however, study the charts and it looks like the number infected is slowing down and approaching the peak. Meanwhile, the number being admitted to hospital with Covid in England is also slowing down - another sign we could be approaching the peak. It's too early to know for sure, but the figures may start to look more positive in the coming weeks. Let's break down thelatest ONS coronavirus figures,externalto see how severe the situation really is. Scotland  England  Wales  Northern Ireland Some more now from the latest ONS survey. A total of 3.5 million people in private households are estimated to have had Covid last week, up 29% from 2.7 million the previous week. This is the highest estimate for total infections since mid-April, but is still below the record high of4.9 million that was reached at the end of March. We've just had the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It shows the rate of people testing positive for Covid has continued to rise across the UK. According to the fresh data, about 1 in 19 people were infected in England, while in Wales about 1 in 17 people would have had coronavirus in the week ending 6 July. Up until the same period at the start of the month in Northern Ireland the rate was about 1 in 17 and in Scotland the rate was about 1 in 16. Allow Twitter content?

The surveys estimate how much of the virus is around and act as a guide as to whether new regulations should be introduced. Covid vaccines modified to target new Covid variants could give better protection when used as a booster, the European Medicines Agency says. Pfizer and Moderna have already developed shots to target two types of Covid - the original one that started the pandemic, plus the Omicron variant called BA.1, which caused the massive wave of infection over the winter. Experts are looking to update the vaccine further to keep up with a virus that is changing or mutating. The US Food and Drug Administration has recommended manufacturers change the design of their booster shots to include components tailored to combat the new BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron that are behind rising infections now. The UK will announce its final plans for the autumn booster Covid vaccine programme nearer the time. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Backers of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have attacked Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they fight to stay in the race to succeed Boris Johnson. Former Brexit Minister Lord Frost said Ms Mordaunt did not ""master detail"" and ex-party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned her level of experience. Ms Mordaunt said rivals were trying to stop her as they did ""not want to run against me"" in a vote by Tory members. She also promised she would ""not engage"" in negative campaigning. Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak came first in Thursday's second round of voting by Conservative MPs for a new party leader and prime minister, with Ms Mordaunt second and Ms Truss third. The eliminated candidate, Attorney-General Suella Braverman, has given her backing to Ms Truss. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalLord Frost urged former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth on Thursday, to quit the race and support Ms Truss ""in return for a serious job"" in government. But Ms Badenoch's campaign said she had ""no intention of stepping down"" and was ""in it to win"". Chris Mason: TV debates can catapult or crush reputations Penny Mordaunt: Brexiteer and grassroots favourite Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor leading the pack Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Channel 4 will broadcast a debate at 19:30 BST between all the candidates, the first of two such events this weekend before the next round of MPs' voting on Monday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party did not ""fear any of the candidates"", accusing them of ""squabbling like cats in a bag"". With the Conservative leadership field now narrowed to five, the comments coming from the rival camps are becoming more bitter and personal. Lord Frost attacked Ms Mordaunt, who once served under him, telling Talk TV that she ""did not master the detail that was necessary"" and had been ""absent on parade"" during Brexit negotiations with the EU. Sir Iain questioned Trade Minister and former Defence Secretary Ms Mordaunt's suitability to be prime minister, telling LBC: ""We can't just elect somebody because for a short period of time they may look better than others."" Despite the name, Lord Frost has turned up the temperature in the leadership race. Initially allies of Liz Truss, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, were gunning for Rishi Sunak, dubbing him the ""high-tax chancellor"". But with Penny Mordaunt beating Ms Truss in to third place in the MPs' ballots so far, they are now taking aim at the former defence secretary. Essentially the charge is that she's too lazy and too ""woke"". But Lord Frost has exposed in public an aspect of leadership contests usually conducted in private. He is offering fourth-placed candidate Kemi Badenoch a deal - ""a serious job"" - if she drops out and backs Ms Truss. The Truss team says she herself isn't offering posts, but you can be assured that when all candidates try to build a coalition of support, they won't simply be relying on a policy platform to get fellow MPs to rally to their banner. And the Frost intervention also reveals a cold, hard reality. It's not clear at this stage who will make the final run-off. So you can expect the battle to become more brutal in the coming days. But Ms Mordaunt dismissed the criticisms of her, telling Sky News the reason she did not ""have a profile"" was that she had ""just been getting on with the job"" of being a minister prior to the Tory leadership contest. She said: ""People are obviously trying to stop me getting into the final [vote by party members] because they don't want to run against me... ""Having seen my polling and having seen how I would fare against them in the final round of this contest, it's understandable how they're trying to stop me."" Ms Mordaunt added: ""Anyone going for this job needs to be tested and scrutinised."" But she said her campaign was ""not engaging in any"" sniping. John Lamont, who is coordinating Ms Mordaunt's campaign in Scotland, called her an ""electoral asset"" and compared her to former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron, saying he had also not been well known by the public before becoming party leader. Meanwhile, Ms Braverman has written to her supporters urging them to back Ms Truss, arguing that Ms Badenoch would ""do a fantastic job as PM one day"" but did not have the backing to make it into the final two. There had been speculation that backbench MP Tom Tugendhat, who came fifth in Thursday's vote, might drop out of the contest. But in a tweet he said he would stay on and put his ""vision for Britain forward to the public"". Mr Sunak got 101 votes on Thursday, with Ms Mordaunt receiving 83 and Ms Truss 64. Ms Badenoch got 49 votes and Mr Tugendhat 32. The next round of voting takes place on Monday, as MPs whittle down the field to two, who will then face a postal ballot of Tory members to decide the winner. The final result will be announced on 5 September, when Mr Johnson will leave office. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM?

"This video can not be played On Friday the Met Office issued a red warning for extreme heat A national emergency has been declared after a red extreme heat warning was issued for the first time, as temperatures could hit 40C (104F). The Met Office's highest warning covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It means there is a risk to life and daily routines will need to change. Speed restrictions are likely on railway lines, some schools will close early and some hospital appointments will be cancelled. On the roads, gritters are planning to spread sand to reduce melting, and the RAC has warned more drivers will need help as cars overheat. On top of the Met Office warning, the UK Health Security Agency issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". NHS leaders on Friday evening warned there would be greater demand for ambulances and patients could be at risk if left outside hospitals in emergency vehicles in hot weather. In a letter they said ambulances should not wait outside emergency departments more than 30 minutes before offloading patients. Is the UK getting hotter? Schools prepare to close early How hot is it where you are? It is the first time a red heat warning has been issued for parts of the UK, although the extreme heat warning system was only introduced in 2021. Downing Street said the alert was being treated as a national emergency. Officials met on Friday and will meet again during the weekend to discuss the response. The weather at the start of next week is forecast to be warm across the UK but temperatures will be more like 30C in Scotland and Northern Ireland, rather than the high 30s predicted in parts of England and Wales. The heatwave - originating in north Africa - is spreading across Europe and has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said it was ""potentially a very serious situation"", with a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C - likely along the A1 corridor, running from London northwards towards Yorkshire and the North East. The highest recorded temperature in the UK was 38.7C in Cambridge in 2019 and BBC Weather presenter Matt Taylor said there is now a realistic possibility of hitting 40C in the UK. ""That is exceptionally hot, the sort of temperatures that if you are on holiday you may be able to deal with but in day-to-day life it can have severe impacts on health,"" he said. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Read more from James Gallagher here. Night-time temperatures in some areas will not drop below 25C but they are likely to start cooling off from Wednesday. Met Office CEO Penny Endersby said the extreme heat forecast was ""absolutely unprecedented"" and she urged people to take the warning as seriously as a red or amber warning for snow or wind. People in the UK are used to treating hot weather as a ""chance to go and play in the sun"" but ""this is not that sort of weather"", she said.

"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

"This video can not be played On Friday the Met Office issued a red warning for extreme heat A national emergency has been declared after a red extreme heat warning was issued for the first time, as temperatures could hit 40C (104F). The Met Office's highest warning covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It means there is a risk to life and daily routines will need to change. Speed restrictions are likely on railway lines, some schools will close early and some hospital appointments will be cancelled. On the roads, gritters are planning to spread sand to reduce melting, and the RAC has warned more drivers will need help as cars overheat. On top of the Met Office warning, the UK Health Security Agency issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". NHS leaders on Friday evening warned there would be greater demand for ambulances and patients could be at risk if left outside hospitals in emergency vehicles in hot weather. In a letter they said ambulances should not wait outside emergency departments more than 30 minutes before offloading patients. Is the UK getting hotter? Schools prepare to close early How hot is it where you are? It is the first time a red heat warning has been issued for parts of the UK, although the extreme heat warning system was only introduced in 2021. Downing Street said the alert was being treated as a national emergency. Officials met on Friday and will meet again during the weekend to discuss the response. The weather at the start of next week is forecast to be warm across the UK but temperatures will be more like 30C in Scotland and Northern Ireland, rather than the high 30s predicted in parts of England and Wales.

"Protesters in Colombo celebrated at news of the resignation Sri Lanka's parliament has accepted ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, ending rule by a family that wielded power for nearly 20 years. Mr Rajapaksa quit after fleeing to Singapore amid mass protests over his mismanagement of the economy. Sri Lanka is in the grip of economic chaos as it faces an acute shortage of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Rajapaksa's resignation paves the way for the country to begin the process of electing a new president. Sri Lanka's speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said on Friday that he accepted Mr Rajapaksa's resignation, which he received late on Thursday. He has called for parliament to convene on Saturday to start the process of electing a new leader. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as acting president. Parliament has up to a month to elect a new leader, who could be Mr Wickremesinghe. Mr Rajapaksa fled to Singapore on Thursday from the Maldives, as huge protests roiled Sri Lanka. He is believed to have wanted to leave Sri Lanka before stepping down in order to avoid the possibility of arrest under a new administration. The embattled leader arrived in Singapore earlier on Thursday after first flying to the Maldives on Tuesday night. Reports say he is accompanied by his wife and two bodyguards. Singapore's foreign ministry said Mr Rajapaksa had not asked for asylum or been granted asylum. ""Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum,"" it added. In the capital Colombo on Thursday, delighted demonstrators greeted news of the president's departure with dancing. ""We are beyond happy, but also beyond relieved so we can take a break and go back to our lives,"" Viraga Perera told the BBC. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa defied calls for his resignation for months but has now fled But the crowds appeared smaller than before after Mr Wickremesinghe imposed a fresh round of curfews on Thursday to quell protests. The streets of Colombo were calmer as anti-government demonstrators began leaving some of the official buildings they had occupied. ""We are peacefully withdrawing from the presidential palace, the presidential secretariat and the prime minister's office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,"" said a spokeswoman for the protesters. One person died and 84 others were injured during Wednesday's protests, which took place at key landmarks around the capital, Colombo, including the prime minister's office. Protesters broke into the presidential palace on Saturday and set fire to the prime minister's private home. Police fired tear gas at protesters attempting to break down the gates of the prime minister's office in Colombo, before finally forcing their way in. They later headed for parliament but did not get in. Wednesday saw some of the biggest demonstrations since the protests first began in April. by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo The resignation letter Sri Lankans have been waiting for since people power toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa has finally arrived. The letter does several things. Firstly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's position as acting president is legitimised. Under Sri Lanka's constitution the prime minister becomes caretaker leader in the event of the president resigning. Secondly, it clears obstacles blocking the holding of an election in parliament for a new president. MPs had been due to meet on 15 July and start this process, with a vote promised a week later. That was delayed by the lack of a resignation letter but now it has arrived the Speaker will be able to reconvene parliament. The two main candidates so far are likely to be Mr Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. But given the governing party has a majority, its MPs are likely to back Mr Wickremesinghe - who has close links with the Rajapaksas. Whether Sri Lanka's public would accept this is another matter. The prime minister's resignation, along with that of Mr Rajapaksa, has been a key demand of protesters. Thirdly, the resignation means Gotabaya Rajapaksa no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office By Thursday, protesters had handed back the president's official residence to the authorities when the BBC visited. There were no protesters at parliament on Thursday afternoon, a BBC correspondent confirmed. ""We captured this building to show people power. We give it back the way we captured it and leave. We will come back in the next minute if needed,"" Danish Ali, a protester at the prime minister's office, told BBC Tamil.

Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"Claire has borrowed thousands of pounds, but still splashed out recently on a Fitbit, an exercise bike and a trip to Butlins. ""Things are getting more difficult every single day,"" the single mum-of-two admitted. ""And yet I'm not putting money aside, I am spending it."" New research seen by the BBC suggests 25% of people are similarly stretched, but reluctant to stop spending. The Grant Thornton and Retail Economics report surveyed 2,000 UK adults. Claire, who lives in Norfolk, earns around Â£16,000 a year through various jobs in the education sector. She has borrowed Â£6,000 to help make ends meet, and knows that she should be trying to pay that back, in addition to saving a bit every month given the rising cost of living. But she said this rarely happens, because she's prioritising spending on treats for her family after a tough few years during the pandemic. Why are prices rising so quickly? Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter Soaring costs stretching holidaymakers' budgets ""My income fluctuates, but when I have a bit more, I do spend it rather than save it,"" she said. That has included spending Â£100 on a foldable exercise bike and Â£430 on a weekend trip to Butlins holiday resort over the school holidays. Claire said she does feel ""guilty"" for spending on non-essential items, particularly given the rising cost of petrol and food. But after two years of Covid restrictions, she feels like the family deserves it. ""Although I am squeezed, I don't want to compromise on the opportunities and experiences that the kids have,"" she said. ""I feel, if I didn't keep spending on these small things, these little treats - small things for me, slightly bigger for the kids - then we'd just be really miserable."" Although paralegal Joseph Hussain is earning a good salary he said he struggles to stick to his monthly budget. Joseph Hussain, a paralegal and student from London, recently spent Â£300 on rare vinyl which, he admits, ""I didn't really need"". The 27-year-old, who earns Â£27,000, sets himself a monthly allowance but said this quickly goes on petrol, food and other essential items. So he turns to credit cards and buy-now-pay-later companies to fund purchases, which recently included a whole new wardrobe, a Lego bouquet, video games. ""I can't really describe it, I think you just get into this mindset of, well, 'I've already spent so much this month, so I have permission to spend a bit more',"" he said. Joseph admitted he does question whether he should be spending on these items, given the soaring cost of living but doesn't want to miss out on things that bring him joy. ""There's no way on earth I need these plastic Lego flowers or stuff like that, it's just that I very much enjoy them, they make me happy and therefore that's my philosophy in general,"" he said. Claire and Joseph's experiences are not unique, according to new research by Grant Thornton, an accountancy firm, and Retail Economics, an economics consultancy. The research revealed one in four adults in the UK feel they are financially stretched, but are still reluctant to let worrying about the rising cost of living impact their spending habits. These ""squeezed spenders"" recognise the need to cut back some of their spending but generally prefer to borrow, dip into savings or use buy-now-pay-later schemes, rather than allow money worries to get in the way of purchases. Any discretionary income is typically spent on non-essential items, with a lack of willpower cited as the main barrier to saving more regularly. ""This group of squeezed spenders is interesting, precisely because it's counterintuitive,"" Richard Lim, head of Retail Economics, told the BBC. ""These people realise their personal finances are under pressure, but at the same time, they really want don't want to cut back and so they carry on spending, including on things that aren't essential."" How will I get the cost-of-living payments? How high will my energy bill go? Retail sales fall at fastest rate since lockdown Mr Lim said that while some people in this category have a carefree, even frivolous attitude to their spending, others feel they have no choice but to rely on savings and dip into debt. ""It's about protecting a minimum standard of life for their children and for themselves,"" he said. ""The concern is how much is this simply deferring financial hardship into the future,"" he warned. Prices in the UK are currentlyrising at their fastest ratefor 40 years, with soaring food, petrol and energy bills putting pressure on household finances. While one in four adults were identified as ""squeezed spenders"", others are making drastic cutbacks to offset sharp rises in their everyday living costs, according to the research. The data show just over a third of UK adults are financially distressed and plan to cut back across most, if not all, of their non-essential spending. Another quarter are seen as ""comfortably cautious"" - consumers who are financially secure, but still worry about the cost-of-living crisis, choosing to cut back across some of their spending as a precaution. Only 14% of households are financially immune, with no plans to cut back their spending. Taken as a whole, households are set to cut back almost Â£25 billion worth of non-essential spending this year, the research found. Clothing and footwear are at the top of people's cut back list. But consumers are more reluctant to miss out on holidays, with the report suggesting strong pent-up demand for holidays after two years of travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. The survey, which heard from adults across the UK, was carried out at the end of May. Do you owe money but keep on spending? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Climate pledges were a prominent part of the 2019 Conservative manifesto Where do the three remaining contenders in the Conservative leadership race stand on the UK's 'net zero' target to reduce emissions by 2050? Net zero was until recently seen as settled policy, supported by all major political parties and written into law. It's a broad goal committing the UK to dramatically reducing emissions of the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. It stipulates that by 2050 the amount of climate-damaging gases we release will be balanced by gases taken out, hence the name 'net' zero. In the last few weeks the combination of a heatwave, the cost of living crisis and the need to find a new prime minister have led to further debate about the UK's commitment to reaching net zero. That's despite there being clear consensus among scientists that immediate action is needed if we are to have a chance of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C, and reduce the risk of severe consequences from climate change. What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says she's committed to the net zero goal. So what are the final three saying about net zero? Penny Mordaunt is the most enthusiastic. ""Environmentalism and conservatism go hand in hand,"" she toldthe Guardian,external. ""And [it] is a core principle of who I am, someone dedicated to the future of our world and the legacy we leave."" Ms Mordaunt has been making the case that 'net zero' should be seen as an opportunity rather than a cost, with the transition to green energy generating ""millions of jobs over the next decade"".  Expanding renewables (like wind and solar) would, she says ""rapidly enhance the UK's energy security"". As chancellor, Rishi Sunak largely avoided talking about net zero. As a candidate he's committed himself to the policy, though not without a note of caution. ""If we go too hard and too fast then we will lose people,"" he said at the ITV debate on Sunday night. ""And that's no way to get there, and I think we can get there in a way that's about growth, that's about jobs, that's about industries of the future, and that's the way to do it."" Liz Truss was environment secretary under David Cameron and has some of the most prominent net zero sceptics among her supporters. In 2014 she cut subsidies for solar farms, calling them ""a blight on the landscape"". During the leadership debates she did commit to the policy but added that we needed to ""find better ways to deliver net zero"" that won't ""harm people and businesses"". Net zero is not a single policy to agree or disagree with. It extends into many of the decisions that the new prime minister will have to make, and they will have to decide to what extent reaching 'net zero' by 2050 trumps other considerations. Should, for example, the UK be developing new sources of polluting fossil fuels, through fracking, and new gas and oil fields in the North Sea? Do we need a new coal mine in Cumbria? Should it be made easier to build onshore wind turbines (currently the cheapest form of energy generation)? Should the government be doing more to help people save energy (and money) by insulating their homes? Just a month ago the Committee on Climate Change, whose role it is to monitor and advise the government, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government had turned the UK into a ""champion in setting climate goals"" but that there were ""holes"" in the strategy to deliver them. What's being widely called the 'green levy' is in the crosshairs of several leadership contenders. The levy is part of your energy bill and is in fact a mix of social and green programmes. It funds things like the Warm Homes Discount (helping poorer households pay their bills), as well as schemes that support efficiency improvements in homes and businesses, help vulnerable people and encourage the take-up of renewable technology. Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss both say they plan to suspend or remove the 'green levy'. In the debate on Channel Four last Friday Ms Truss said the levy was ""hammering consumers"" and stressed the impact it was having on economic growth and industry. Penny Mordaunt told MPs she planned to suspend the so-called 'green levy' Rishi Sunak has not announced plans to drop it. In the cut and thrust of a debate it sounds like an attractive way to cut soaring energy bills. But the reason you are paying so much has very little to do with the 'green levy'.Energy regulator Ofgem have been clear that the rise in energy prices is almost entirely tied to the soaring wholesale price of gas.,external As bills have sky-rocketed the 'green levy' has crept up on a typical bill from Â£144 in the summer of 2019 to Â£153 now. As a proportion of the typical bill it's fallen from nearly 12% of the total in 2019 to about 8%. There's also the question of what would happen to programmes which the 'green levy' supports. Many are social by nature, aimed at the poorest and most vulnerable. It also pays for some longstanding contracts with energy companies. ""No matter how determined a prime minister is, it's going to be very difficult to just stop them because essentially that's government breaking its contracted promises,"" Daniel Newport, head of Net Zero at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told BBC News. ""What's likely to happen in reality is that the Treasury would end up paying for it rather than just stopping it,"" he said. So you and I could still end up funding the 'green levy' programmes, but through the more progressive method of general taxation, rather than a charge on bills. The pitches from the leadership contenders have been calibrated not just to appeal to fellow MPs but to the Conservative party membership, who will have to choose between the final two contenders. Do they care about net zero? A poll this week carried out byYouGov for the Times,externalsuggests not. Only 4% put net zero in their top three priorities for the new leader, with winning the next election, controlling immigration and cutting taxes among many issues coming higher. Though real enthusiasm for net zero has been in short supply in this campaign, supporters of the policy in the Conservative party now feel that the immediate threat might be over. In the first few days of the leadership campaign they'd worried that well organised net zero sceptic MPs were gaining traction. There's since been a concerted effort from the many Conservative MPs who support the policy to get contenders to address environmental issues and publically commit to continuing net zero. Chris Skidmore MP signed into law the commitment to net zero by 2050. Chris Skidmore was the minister who signed the net zero legislation into law in 2019. He told BBC News that candidates are now aware that the polling in marginal 'red wall' areas suggests that people do care about climate change. ""What we've managed to do in the last week is to say: 'Look, this is a mainstream issue. It would be electoral suicide to dump net zero. We'd be making our electoral grave.'"" Apoll carried out in Apri,externall backs up his argument. It suggests that 64% of voters support the goal of reaching net zero by 2050, and that ditching the policy would cost the Conservative party support.

"The NHS is preparing for a surge in demand from people affected by rising temperatures in England and Wales. An extreme heat weather warning applies from Sunday to Tuesday as temperatures are due to peak in excess of 35C (95F) in south, central and east England. It means there could be a danger to life or potential serious illness. Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the first line of defence was ""behavioural change"" and the key thing was to ""prepare"" government services. Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, he said it was critical that people look out for ""the most vulnerable groups"". Weather forecasts suggest mid to high-30s for the weekend but Mr Malthouse warned there was a ""smaller possibility that we could exceed that and possibly hit 40 which would be an all-time record"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The key thing we can do is prepare the government services for what may be a surge in demand - not least the health service and elsewhere"". Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Extreme weather warning extended to Tuesday Is the UK getting hotter? Temperatures in the wider area covered by the warning are more widely predicted to be as high as 35C, peaking on Tuesday, the Met Office said. Forecasters say they could be as high as 39C in parts of southern and eastern England. People are being urged to stay hydrated, look out for vulnerable people, keep curtains closed and stay out of the sun in the middle of the day. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. The Met Office said the hot weather was caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe. A heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Pressures are already high onNHS services, with patients in England waiting longer for ambulances. Figures from June show that it took an average of 51 minutes for ambulances to respond to emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes - the target is 18. Emily Shuckburgh, professor of environmental data science at the University of Cambridge, described extreme heat as a ""silent killer"". More than 2,500 heat-related deaths were recorded in the summer of 2020, with the elderly especially vulnerable, she said. People are advised to find shade and avoid exposure to the sun during the middle of the day Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said older people who already struggle with significant health issues are ""going to find the coming heatwave a challenge"". She urged people to check on elderly relatives and friends during the high heat. Rail firm Avanti West Coast has warned of disrupted journeys over the coming days because of the extreme weather and staff shortages. It tweeted that services might be cancelled at short notice at the weekend, with amended timetables and extended journey times expected on Monday and Tuesday. Network Rail said it was preparing the railway to keep passengers safe ""ahead of next week's very high temperatures"". Meanwhile, teachers' leaders fear schools may have to cancel sports days to protect students and staff during the heatwave. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said: ""It is extremely dangerous to take part in vigorous physical activity in extreme heat, with the risk of heat exhaustion and even heat stroke."" James Bowden, policy director for school leaders' union NAHT, also called on the government to ""give urgent thought"" to improving school buildings, saying poorly ventilated classrooms are ""inconducive to work"". In other developments: Runners in the Rabbit Run trail race in Bridgend county on Saturdayhave been advised to go slowlyamid concerns about extreme heat. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that the extreme heat and months of below average rainfall is causing concern. Richard Bramley from the NFU said the agriculture sector was ""way behind"" with water management and had not yet adapted to the changing climate. Hammersmith Bridge in west London, which was closed in 2020 due to a heatwave, has beenwrapped in giant pieces of foil to stop it from overheating. Plus, animals at a wildlife park in Oxfordshirehave been given frozen smoothiesmade from ingredients including pears and carrots to keep them cool.

"Zarli Naing was a 27-year-old nurse helping the resistance At about 13:00 on 14 June, members of the volunteer People's Defence Force arrived at a patch of ground in the fields between two villages just west of the Chindwin River, in central Myanmar. They had been alerted by a cow herder, who had spotted crows picking at what he believed was a corpse. The volunteers saw a human hand protruding from the earth. It belonged to a young fighter from their group, Wu Khong, who had been injured and gone missing during an attack by the army four days earlier. With him, in the shallow grave, were four other bodies, dismembered and burned. From the clothing, a watch and a medical bag found nearby, they also identified 27-year-old Zarli Naing, a nurse who had come to this area in the Magway Region last year to provide healthcare to insurgents and locals. They were opposingMyanmar's military which had seized power on 1 February 2021, overthrowing the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Through interviews with Zarli Naing's friends and family, those who trained her, and the villagers and fighters she lived with until her death, the BBC has pieced together the story of a bright and courageous young woman whose decision to oppose the coup ended in tragedy. This is also the story of the desperate resistance being put up against the military junta by communities across a large swathe of the dry zone, an impoverished and drought-prone region of Myanmar. Zarli Naing was working in the rural and largely poor Magway Region, where the resistance is strong Zarli Naing was the youngest of four girls from a poor farming family, which lived close to the great temple complex of Bagan. The only one of them who did well at school, she went on to qualify as a nurse and got a job at a hospital in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. She was working there when the coup happened. Like thousands of other healthcare workers across the country, Zarli Naing joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM), refusing to work with the military-controlled administration. A month after the coup, she left Nay Pyi Taw and returned to her home village. But fearing her political activism would endanger her family, she decided to move on to a safe zone in the north of Magway, which is largely controlled by opposition forces such as the People's Defence Force or PDF. There she became part of an extensive underground healthcare network run by the thousands of doctors and nurses who have left their jobs in protest against the coup. She was also trying to complete an online degree course from the prestigious University of Nursing in Mandalay. She had started the programme in early 2020, but it was disrupted by the pandemic. ""When I spoke to her a month ago she told me how happy she was to be there,"" says one of her online supervisors, a nursing instructor for the clandestine network. ""She was especially happy that she could give first aid training to the PDF fighters in her area, because there are no other healthcare staff there. She was the only one able to give that service to them."" Aung San Suu Kyi, a Burmese icon, has a big following in Magway Region... and her arrest during the 2021 coup sparked huge protests in Myanmar Zarli Naing had spent the past 14 months in a village called Dan Bin Gan. She was invited there by a friend, Khin Hnin Wai, a teacher the same age as her, who was working at a school run by a respected head teacher, Win Kyaw. Win Kyaw was a prominent local CDM leader who backed the parallel National Unity Government, which was formed last year to challenge the military junta's rule. Dan Bin Gan was, in effect, a liberated zone. It had an active PDF wing, which had established its base in the centre of the village. Most of the 2,500 inhabitants are farmers, eking out a living from cultivating beans, sesame and groundnuts, and a little corn to feed their cattle. This part of Myanmar is known for being deeply loyal to Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, which, in the last election, won every seat in Magway in both the national and local parliaments. Opposition to the coup here, and in neighbouring southern Sagaing Region, is as strong as anywhere in Myanmar, with dozens of volunteer militias taking on the army using captured and home-made guns, and improvised mines. The village also lies just 6km (nearly 4 miles) from Sin Pyu Shin bridge, one of the only road crossings of the Chindwin River, and so vital for moving troops and other reinforcements around. Zarli Naing offered the only medical treatment for communities no longer able to use the local hospital, both because it was under military control, and also because after the coup so many nurses and doctors had abandoned state-run institutions. Friends and PDF fighters who knew her say she was deeply committed to the armed struggle, and ran first aid classes for the fighters. Those who knew Zarli Naing say she was passionate about her work and hopeful for Myanmar's future ""Zarli was very strong,"" says another of her supervisors, who is based in the UK, where some medics are providing support for the underground health network in Myanmar. ""She was always very upbeat. She never spoke about her own difficulties. She just asked smart questions when she needed to fix something. The clandestine health workers can get depressed by the challenges they face. ""Sometimes their patients cannot reach them because of roadblocks or fighting, and they cannot refer patients to hospitals if they need more complex surgery. That is very hard for them - many of their patients in that situation do not survive."" But Zarli Naing ""did not express any regret for the path she had chosen"", says a friend who worked near her in northern Magway. ""There were many times she missed her family. She never told them what she was doing. Knowing she was working for the CDM would have put them in danger. ""We used to ask people we knew for donations, to pay for the medicines we needed. We often used to speak together on the phone, and talk about the medical problems we faced, or about our support for the CDM."" From her Facebook page she seems to have been a keen reader, posting colourful covers of the Burmese novels she liked. The photos of herself that she shared show her either reading, or holding up her hand in the three-fingered symbol of defiance that has become so popular in South East Asia in recent years. One post has a series of pictures of a much younger Aung San Suu Kyi with her family back in the UK. The day before Zarli Naing died - 9 June - three PDF groups together launched an attack on the military post guarding the Sin Pyu Shin bridge, killing three soldiers and taking control of it for a few hours. A military counter-attack was inevitable, and in the early hours of 10 June, about 30 soldiers in four vehicles were spotted making for Dan Bin Gan from the east. Not all the soldiers were in uniform, but those that were could be identified by their shoulder badges as coming from infantry battalions 256, 257 and 258, based at Hpu Lon, near Yesagyo town about 25km to the south. At 03:00 the residents of Dan Bin Gan started fleeing the village, heading for open country to the west. Zarli Naing was among them. To slow the army down PDF fighters laid homemade mines along the road into Dan Bin Gan. One of them, Wu Khong, injured his leg in a fall while doing this. Zarli Naing stayed with him to treat his leg. Win Kyaw, who was protective of the young nurse, stayed back too. So did Zarli Naing's friend, Khin Hnin Wai, who was pregnant, and another young female fighter, Thae Ei Ei Win. They had run to the western edge of Dan Bin Gan, according to eyewitnesses, but had stopped for Zarli Naing to deal with Wu Khong's injury, when they were intercepted by a group of soldiers. Guided by an informer, the soldiers had come around the south of the village to avoid the mines. They captured Zarli Naing and her friends, tied their hands, and together with nine other people they had detained, began marching them north for about an hour to the village of Thit Gyi Taw. Eyewitnesses heard the soldiers asking their captives if they were members of the CDM, and warning that they could be jailed or shot. They say the soldiers repeatedly struck and kicked their captives; and stole food and alcohol from the now empty homes in the villages. According to PDF sources, they also set 70 houses in Thit Gyi Taw alight, sending up a large plume of black smoke over the fields. This video can not be played Watch: The young rebels fighting for democracy Later in the afternoon the captives were moved a little way south to a temple in a village called Peik Thit Kan. Nine of them were then released, the soldiers telling them to run for their lives. One of them told us the remaining five were still alive at that point. Exactly what happened to Zarli Naing and the other four prisoners after that is unclear. At some point in the night they were moved south of Peik Thit Kan, and killed by their captors. Some villagers have reported hearing them shouting for help. But it's not clear when and why their bodies were dismembered and burned. Local PDF fighters believe the military targeted Dan Bin Gan because it was a known centre of resistance to the coup, and also because of the school established there by Win Kyaw. The school had opened only in May, but had already attracted 250 students. Its success made it something of a showcase for the parallel administration which the National Unity Government is trying to run outside military-controlled zones. The PDF believes the informer travelling with the soldiers identified Win Kyaw, Zarli Naing and Khin Hnin Wai as important figures in Dan Bin Gan. Killing them has robbed the village and surrounding communities of leaders who helped to sustain the insurgency. Locals have built a memorial for Zarli Naing and the others who were killed that night It has also robbed Myanmar of a promising young nurse, in a country which, even before the disastrous military takeover, had one of Asia's poorest healthcare systems. ""I am sure she was a wonderful nurse,"" says her online instructor. ""She always tried so hard to do a good job. ""Just imagine, she was providing healthcare to the people of the village while all that time she was also taking all our online courses, even though there was no reliable internet access where she was. And she was taking the Bachelor degree course as well. The workload was enormous. ""Even I could not do all that. She was just wonderful. One of her teachers told me that her exam results were really good."" Zarli Naing had finished her first semester exams just two days before she died. At the time of writing, the inhabitants of Dan Bin Gan are still hiding in the forested area to the west of the village. It is the first time they have been forced to evacuate, but many other villages in this region have been attacked multiple times. This has repeatedly displaced their populations, creating serious humanitarian needs which are not being met because of the conflict and lack of access given to international agencies. Thousands of houses in northern Magway and southern Sagaing have been destroyed by the army; even when they feel safe enough to return, people do not have the resources to rebuild their homes. Last year's coup has unleashed a brutal war of attrition in this Burmese heartland, with uncountable casualties. Zarli Naing's story is just one of so many. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks on Ballinesker beach On a warm sunny day it is hard to believe that Ballinesker beach in the south-east of Ireland, about two-and-half hours' drive from Dublin, was to all intents and purposes a Hollywood movie set. During the summer 25 years ago Hollywood stars including Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg set up camp on the County Wexford beach to film part of Saving Private Ryan. Irish Army reservists - members of the FÃ³rsa Cosanta ÃitiÃºil (FCA) - were extras in the re-enactment of the D-Day landings during World War Two. The movie by DreamWorks tells the story of the attempt to save the life of Private James Francis Ryan, whose three brothers had already died fighting in the war. Tom Hanks at the 1998 premiere of Saving Private Ryan Those FCA extras who took part in the landing scenes wore wet suits under their uniforms to stay warm and as dry as possible. A quarter of a century later, one of those extras - John Fowler - vividly remembers the many rehearsals before the final takes. Ballinesker beach in County Wexford was turned into a World War Two movie in the summer of 1997 ""They had pipes underneath the water and sand that had air blowing through simulating live fire,"" he says, ""And if you ran into them then you were dropped, gone and taken out of the film."" Ballinesker beach is a much more relaxing place for John Fowler these days Graham Cadogan, another extra, is proud that he got to share screen time with the movie's main star Tom Hanks. ""I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time to get picked by a talent scout,"" he says. ""It's the scene about 20 minutes in where Hanks is up at the command post looking for his interpreter."" Because of that scene, Graham's grandmother went to her one and only war film. Former FCA member Graham Cadogan shared the silver screen with Tom Hanks Tom Hanks, the regular guy who played baseball with the crew and extras on the beach, impressed many. Paul Bolger remembers their time lying beside each other in the ""warm tents"" for drying out wet clothes. He says that after a couple of minutes the movie star pulled up the helmet he had rested on ""turned it upside down and started reading his lines from inside his helmet"". ""Then he'd put it back under his head and he'd mumble away his lines for another while. He was just one of the lads."" Paul Bolger camped with Tom Hanks as the Hollywood star rehearsed his lines Although Saving Private Ryan won five Oscars including best director for Steven Spielberg, it lost out in the best picture category to Shakespeare in Love. Despite that, Donald Clarke, the Irish Times film correspondent says it is a very influential war film. ""We are dealing with a director who until that point, despite Schindler's List, was seen as a bit of a sentimentalist,"" he says, ""So, it was quite shocking that you had him depict the landing in the opening half hour of the film with such extreme violence."" Twenty five years later and back on the beach, there is little or no evidence that movie stars and film crews were once here. But at least the extras from the Irish Army reserve still have their fond memories.

"Adam Price said he wants the discussion to look ""forward"" and set a long term strategy Plaid Cymru members are being asked for ideas for the party's future. The consultation will cover a range of topics including independence, Europe, and political cooperation. Plaid came third in the 2021 Senedd election, behind Labour and the Welsh Conservatives, but gained control of three extra councils in May's local elections. Leader Adam Price said he wanted the discussion to ""look forward"" and set a long-term strategy. Plaid Cymru struck a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government on a variety of policies including expanding free school meals, a bigger Senedd and a council tax revaluation. Plaid failing to challenge Drakeford, say Tories Labour-Plaid deal 'will change thousands of lives' Plaid's Adam Price could face Senedd questions The party's key goal of Welsh independence will be part of the discussion, with members asked to contribute their thoughts on issues like time scales and effective routes to get there. With changes planned for UK and Welsh parliaments' constituencies before the next set of elections, the consultation will also ask about changes to the Plaid's organisational structure. In the introduction to the document, Mr Price wrote: ""If we are to succeed in convincing our fellow citizens to support our vision and persuade them to join us in realising it, we need that vision to be clear among ourselves, and understand the strategic choices we will have to make to most effectively achieve our goals. ""That means we need to discuss, debate and decide democratically the best way forward for our party in the years ahead.""

"This video can not be played Judy Baker gave birth aged 18 and was pressured into giving up her baby for adoption Hundreds of thousands of unmarried women who were forced to give up their babies for adoption should receive a government apology, a report has said. The inquiry, by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, was set up following a series of reports by BBC News. It says 185,000 women in the 1950s, 60s and 70s were ""shamed"" and ""coerced"" into giving up their babies. Judy Baker, who was 18 when she gave birth in the 1960s, said she never got to say goodbye to her baby. Many women say they were denied pain relief during birth and were abused by social workers, nurses and other staff. The committee's report says the women were subjected to ""cruelty"", ""abuse"" and ""pressure"" - all for the purpose of getting them to hand over their babies for adoption. Many women were initially sent away to mother and baby homes, often run by churches, because their parents were so embarrassed by their pregnancy. The women ""were considered to have transgressed"" and had to be punished, the report said. Evidence was taken from around 300 people, mostly birth mothers and adopted children. Forced adoptions to be investigated by Parliament Mothers urged to talk to forced adoptions inquiry ""I'll never get over being forced to give up my baby"" Most of the mothers are now in their 70s or 80s, with the adopted people in their 40s and 50s. These witnesses spoke of the ""shame"" and ""secrecy"" that surrounded their pregnancy. During early medical appointments, the report says, the women were treated in a ""dismissive"" and ""cruel"" way. One woman told the inquiry: ""My (male) GP told me I was a social menace."" Adoption agencies, too, became involved at an early stage. One witness told the inquiry she ""was belittled and bullied into thinking I had only one option"", namely, to have her baby adopted. Some of the worst experiences came in hospital, when they went to give birth. Pat Tugwell was a schoolgirl when she became pregnant in 1964. She recalls going into labour, but being roughly handled by a nurse during an intimate examination. ""It was painful, it was painful,"" she told me. ""She looked at me and she said 'oh I don't know how you can get pregnant if you can't let me do this to you'. ""It was just such an awful thing to say. She would never have said it to anybody else who was married, so why did she say that to me just because I was unmarried? She obviously thought I was one of the lowest of the low."" Another woman was told by a nurse that she ""deserved all the pain I got"" during her delivery. A doctor said to another mother that ""I should be sterilised as I must be a nymphomaniac"". Many women told the committee they were not even allowed to hold their newborn baby. One wrote that ""they pulled her out of my armsâ¦ the pain was unbearable"". Another woman said: ""I screamedâ¦ and hung onto him like a woman possessed."" Other evidence detailed the trauma of handing babies over to social workers. Judy Baker, who was 18 when she gave birth in 1967, recalled being told to put her baby down in a room, turn around and leave. ""I never got to say goodbye,"" she said. ""I was just told I would get on with my life. It was as if it never happened. I had to wait 32 years before I could say 'hello' again. ""How can you do that to a teenager and to an innocent baby? How can you part them simply because I was unmarried? It was cruel, traumatic and should never have happened."" Chair of the committee, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said the affected women had ""suffered from shame and vilification and the burden of secrecy for decades"". ""The least the government can do is recognise that this shouldn't have happened then and it would never happen now, and it's right for the government to apologise."" Hundreds of birth mothers and adoptees have long campaigned for a government apology. Veronica, who was 24 when she was forced to give up her child, told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that such an apology would mean ""recognition that what had happened was so wrong, so wrong"". ""I felt very alone"", she said. Veronica was able to trace her daughter through an intermediary contact 25 years after the forced adoption, but her daughter ""really wasn't ready at the time"". Later on, Veronica met in 2004 with her daughter who had a child of her own by then. ""It was a lovely day"", Veronica added. This video can not be played Liz Harvie was taken from her birth mother, Yvonne, as a child Liz Harvie was born in 1974 after her mother was pressured to put her up for adoption. She says she has always had problems with her identity, but an apology would help. ""Some people say an apology, you know sorry, is just a small word, but I think really what lies behind the apology is the validation of all the pain and suffering that we have actually silently experienced. ""There's lots of shame, lots of guilt, there's lots of secrecy and being part of a secret society like this involved in forced adoptions has been extremely difficult for everyone involved."" Ms Baker said an apology was ""never, ever too late"". ""Sorry is so important and all of us out there are still living with the trauma and the pain that this has caused us. ""I've spent 50-plus years of my life, marked, scarred, by the trauma."" The committee concluded there are ""some things that only a government can do, and it falls on the government to make this apology"". In its response to the committee's conclusions, the government said: ""We have the deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. ""While we cannot undo the past, we have strengthened our legislation and practice to be built on empathy, from NHS maternity services caring for vulnerable women and babies, to our work transforming the adoption process and care system to help children settle into stable homes."" The committee also urged the government to provide better counselling services for birth mothers and adopted people. And it called for improved access to birth and medical records, saying there are often huge disparities in the timeliness of the responses of local authorities.

"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

"Backers of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have attacked Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they fight to stay in the race to succeed Boris Johnson. Former Brexit Minister Lord Frost said Ms Mordaunt did not ""master detail"" and ex-party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned her level of experience. Ms Mordaunt said rivals were trying to stop her as they did ""not want to run against me"" in a vote by Tory members. She also promised she would ""not engage"" in negative campaigning. Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak came first in Thursday's second round of voting by Conservative MPs for a new party leader and prime minister, with Ms Mordaunt second and Ms Truss third. The eliminated candidate, Attorney-General Suella Braverman, has given her backing to Ms Truss. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalLord Frost urged former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth on Thursday, to quit the race and support Ms Truss ""in return for a serious job"" in government. But Ms Badenoch's campaign said she had ""no intention of stepping down"" and was ""in it to win"". Chris Mason: TV debates can catapult or crush reputations Penny Mordaunt: Brexiteer and grassroots favourite Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor leading the pack Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Channel 4 will broadcast a debate at 19:30 BST between all the candidates, the first of two such events this weekend before the next round of MPs' voting on Monday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party did not ""fear any of the candidates"", accusing them of ""squabbling like cats in a bag"". With the Conservative leadership field now narrowed to five, the comments coming from the rival camps are becoming more bitter and personal. Lord Frost attacked Ms Mordaunt, who once served under him, telling Talk TV that she ""did not master the detail that was necessary"" and had been ""absent on parade"" during Brexit negotiations with the EU. Sir Iain questioned Trade Minister and former Defence Secretary Ms Mordaunt's suitability to be prime minister, telling LBC: ""We can't just elect somebody because for a short period of time they may look better than others."" Despite the name, Lord Frost has turned up the temperature in the leadership race. Initially allies of Liz Truss, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, were gunning for Rishi Sunak, dubbing him the ""high-tax chancellor"". But with Penny Mordaunt beating Ms Truss in to third place in the MPs' ballots so far, they are now taking aim at the former defence secretary. Essentially the charge is that she's too lazy and too ""woke"". But Lord Frost has exposed in public an aspect of leadership contests usually conducted in private. He is offering fourth-placed candidate Kemi Badenoch a deal - ""a serious job"" - if she drops out and backs Ms Truss. The Truss team says she herself isn't offering posts, but you can be assured that when all candidates try to build a coalition of support, they won't simply be relying on a policy platform to get fellow MPs to rally to their banner. And the Frost intervention also reveals a cold, hard reality. It's not clear at this stage who will make the final run-off. So you can expect the battle to become more brutal in the coming days. But Ms Mordaunt dismissed the criticisms of her, telling Sky News the reason she did not ""have a profile"" was that she had ""just been getting on with the job"" of being a minister prior to the Tory leadership contest. She said: ""People are obviously trying to stop me getting into the final [vote by party members] because they don't want to run against me... ""Having seen my polling and having seen how I would fare against them in the final round of this contest, it's understandable how they're trying to stop me."" Ms Mordaunt added: ""Anyone going for this job needs to be tested and scrutinised."" But she said her campaign was ""not engaging in any"" sniping. John Lamont, who is coordinating Ms Mordaunt's campaign in Scotland, called her an ""electoral asset"" and compared her to former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron, saying he had also not been well known by the public before becoming party leader. Meanwhile, Ms Braverman has written to her supporters urging them to back Ms Truss, arguing that Ms Badenoch would ""do a fantastic job as PM one day"" but did not have the backing to make it into the final two. There had been speculation that backbench MP Tom Tugendhat, who came fifth in Thursday's vote, might drop out of the contest. But in a tweet he said he would stay on and put his ""vision for Britain forward to the public"". Mr Sunak got 101 votes on Thursday, with Ms Mordaunt receiving 83 and Ms Truss 64. Ms Badenoch got 49 votes and Mr Tugendhat 32. The next round of voting takes place on Monday, as MPs whittle down the field to two, who will then face a postal ballot of Tory members to decide the winner. The final result will be announced on 5 September, when Mr Johnson will leave office. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM?

"The government's flagship Online Safety Bill - aimed at protecting children from harmful content - has been put on hold until the autumn when a new prime minister will be in place. Opposition parties have accused ministers of ""giving up on governing"" while Conservative MPs battle it out to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Government sources have blamed the delay of the bill on Labour for using up limited Parliamentary time with a no confidence vote in the government. Labour has rejected the accusation arguing the government is in charge of the timetable. The bill is setto return to Parliament in the autumn,but a new prime minister may want to rethink the legislation or appoint a new culture secretary. One leadership contender, Kemi Badenoch, has said the bill is ""in no fit state to become law"" and that she would ensure it ""doesn't overreach"". Other big policy decisions are also in limbo, including: Tax has become a major battleground in the Tory leadership contest. Broadly speaking, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is arguing for no tax cuts until inflation is under control. The other contenders are all saying they would cut taxes if they become PM. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the foreign affairs committee - want to reverse a rise in National Insurance. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt has promised to increase income tax thresholds for basic and middle income earners in line with inflation. The thresholds - the point at which people start paying the tax or paying it at a higher rate - are currently frozen for four years from April 2022. Next year, corporation tax is due to rise from 19% to 25%. However, some leadership hopefuls, including Mrs Badenoch have said they want to see corporate tax lowered. What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Boris Johnson freely admits that the cost of living crisis is the biggest domestic challenge his government faces. Before he announced his resignation, he had been expected to hold regular press conferences to highlight what the government was doing to help. These will not now happen, Downing Street said. Labour has urged the government to cut VAT on energy bills to help ease the cost of living crisis, while some of the Conservative leadership candidates - including Suella Braverman - have proposed a VAT cut on fuel. Asked whether the government would intervene if the cost of living crisis worsened, the PM's spokesman said it would not seek to introduce fiscal measures that would have a ""significant impact"" on the next prime minister. Food prices fall but bills may still keep rising The rising price of things like food and petrol, have led to demands for wage increases. Some sectors - rail workers and barristers - have gone on strike for better pay, while unions representing teachers and nurses have suggested they could also take action. When chancellor, Mr Sunak pledged public sector workers would see ""fair and affordable pay rises"" and a public sector pay review is still going ahead, despite his resignation. In past years, many of the decisions about the annual pay settlements have been made in the final days of July. Pay rises below inflation could lead to strikes, but there are questions over whether a temporary government would have the power to offer above inflation increases. With inflation at a 40-year high and heading for double digits, any decisions on this, including whether the Treasury provides the funds for rises higher than 2-3%, will not wait for the months' long completion of a leadership contest. Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? The government has introduced a bill to scrap parts of its deal with the EU on post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland. The EU were very critical arguing the bill was illegal and would not work. Tim Durrant, of the Institute for Government think tank, says: ""There are strong feelings in the Tory party that the NI Protocol issue needs to be sorted and it will be a key topic during the leadership contest."" The government is hoping that the legislation will clear its Commons stages by the end of next week. But if a new prime minister wanted to rewrite the bill, they will have ample opportunity to do so when it goes through its Lords stages in the autumn, which may take several months, says the BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy. MPs reject changes to Northern Ireland Protocol Bill What Tory candidates think about Northern Ireland The plan to privatise Channel 4 - announced in May - delighted some Conservative MPs, but made others feel deeply uneasy. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has argued that government ownership is holding the channel back. But the move was also likely to face opposition in Parliament, particularly the House of Lords. A bill has not yet been introduced to Parliament and a new prime minister might decide to can it rather than face a potentially tricky battle. What could privatising Channel 4 mean? In office but not in power? What can and can't a ""caretaker government"" do? The basic principle is that the continuity Johnson administration can't pre-empt big decisions for their successor. So no major new policies, laws, public appointments... The trouble is - an unexpected event. Even caretaker governments still have to govern, and possibly take urgent actions - and this one has a cost of living crisis, a war in Ukraine and a continuing pandemic crowding its in-tray. And it may have to do quite big things in response. But non-urgent policy changes are now on hold. The key text on this is the Cabinet Manual (the rulebook for senior ministers) which will leave top civil servants to police the grey areas around what is urgent and what can await the new leadership. ""It becomes about responsible decision-making,"" says Dr Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government think tank. It's a situation senior civil servants have to navigate when prime ministers step down, or lose a confidence vote, or call an election.
