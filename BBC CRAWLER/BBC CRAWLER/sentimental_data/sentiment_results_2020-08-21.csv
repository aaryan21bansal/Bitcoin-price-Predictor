"One of the women found in a flat in east London was mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa A convicted sex offender who is on trial charged with murdering two women and storing their bodies in a freezer has told a jury he is a ""decent guy"". Zahid Younis, 36, is accused of killing Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa and hiding their remains, which were discovered at his flat in April 2019. Prosecutors say he subjected both women to ""very significant violence"". Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, he denied being in a relationship with Ms Szucs. The defendant said she became ""obsessed"" with him after they had sex and that, out of goodness, he would feed her when she came round. Zahid Younis is a convicted sex offender, the court has heard Jurors have heard that Mr Younis was once jailed for sexual activity with a child and for violence against a separate teenage girl. Mr Younis said that he may have done ""unnatural things"" in the past, but that the ""decency doesn't go"". Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the defendant he was a ""dishonest, fabricating, manipulative liar"". The prosecutor said Mr Younis ""went off [Ms Szucs]"" when he ""discovered a bit about her past"". Mr Younis has told the court he met her in hospital in early 2016, but that he later lost interest after she revealed her work as a prostitute. The bodies of the two women were found at a flat in Vandome Close, Canning Town The prosecution says Mr Younis murdered Ms Szucs in his flat in Vandome Close, Canning Town, east London, after she moved there thinking that he also had feelings for her. Mr Younis claimed that he came home one day in October 2016 to find Ms Szucs dead on his sofa. The defendant said he then hid her body in a newly-purchased freezer with the help of a local criminal. He told jurors that the same criminal - and an older man with a walking stick - brought the body of Ms Mustafa round in a wheelie bin in May 2018, forcing him to hide a second body in his freezer. The criminal had threatened to ""tell everyone I already had a body in my flat"", the defendant said. Mr Younis said he had only briefly met Ms Mustafa at a friend's home, denied ever contacting her by phone, and said he did not know how her fingerprint came to be in his flat. The trial continues.

"DeAngelo will spend the rest of his life behind bars after pleading guilty to 13 murders Joseph DeAngelo, the man known as the Golden State Killer, has been sentenced to life in prison. His sentencing is the culmination of a crime investigation that began in the 1970s and attracted worldwide interest. DeAngelo, 74, was arrested in 2018 after his DNA was found on a genealogy website. In June he admitted to 13 murders in a deal with US prosecutors meant to spare him the death penalty. He also admitted to numerous rapes, burglaries and other crimes at the time. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert on Friday called DeAngelo a ""sociopath in action"". After sitting silent and expressionless throughout victims' testimony this week, DeAngelo addressed those in court on Friday, removing his mask and rising from a wheelchair to speak, shortly before Judge Michael Bowman began the sentencing. ""I've listened to all of your statements. Each one of them. And I'm truly sorry to everyone I've hurt,"" said DeAngelo. The infamous killer will now likely die in prison, serving 11 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, with 15 concurrent life sentences and other time for weapons charges. ""When a person commits monstrous acts they need to be locked away where they could never harm another innocent person,"" Judge Bowman said. A Sacramento police officer wipes her eyes as she listens to the impact statements of DeAngelo's victims Prosecutors ultimately did not seek the death penalty, due partially to California's moratorium on executions. Judge Bowman said on Friday that the sentence he chose was the ""absolute maximum"" the court was able to impose under the law. ""The survivors have spoken,"" he said. ""Clearly the defendant deserves no mercy."" DeAngelo was a Californian police officer during his crimes in the 1970s and 80s and his crimes stretched across the state of California. The former police officer, Vietnam War veteran and auto mechanic was arrested in April 2018 after police tracked him down by matching his DNA with a genealogy website. Investigators designed a new method of DNA tracing, creating a family tree dating back to the 1800s in order to identify him as a suspect. Detectives followed him and collected a piece of rubbish he had thrown away, finding the same DNA recovered from several crime scenes. Prosecutors said on Friday that this method has since been used to solve nearly 100 additional crimes. The 40-year hunt for a killer How familial DNA trapped a murderer for the first time DeAngelo's murderous reign began in 1975, while he was working as a police officer in Exeter, in northern California. Sacramento district attorney Anne Marie Schubert announces the arrest of DeAngelo in 2018 Starting with lurking, stalking and theft, his crimes quickly escalated to a 12-year spree of brutal violence, rape and murder. Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Schubert described DeAngelo as ""a person who has no respect for the rights of human beings, no respect for the law, no compassion, no empathy, no remorse."" ""He is a person who lacks a conscience or a soul."" Ms Schubert then assailed DeAngelo's appearance at trial: an ostensibly fragile old man, escorted to the courtroom in a wheelchair. The prosecutor played video footage of DeAngelo in his jail cell in June and July: doing exercises, hoisting himself up on to the top of a bunk bed, and taking painstaking, careful efforts to block out the light in his cell. The videos demonstrate his ""mental acuity, his dexterity, his ability to deceive, or attempt to deceive, the entire world into believing he is a feeble old man,"" she said. Prosecutors disputed the appearance of DeAngelo as a weak elderly man Prosecutors have described the scale of violence as ""simply staggering"": spanning 87 victims and 53 crime scenes in 11 counties across California. And the sentencing occurred in a university ballroom - the space needed to hold surviving victims and their families. Answering questions on Friday, Ms Schubert said it was possible there were still unidentified victims remaining. ""I don't believe we will ever know the magnitude of what Mr DeAngelo did,"" she said. Earlier this week, some of his victims had their day in court, giving emotional personal testimonies during his sentencing hearing. Many spoke of lifelong scars and painful struggles to heal the damage left by DeAngelo. That included Kris Pedretti, who was 15 when DeAngelo raped her in December 1976. She spoke of how he threatened her life during the attack. ""At three different times that night, I thought I was going to die,"" she said. ""The next morning, December 19, I woke up knowing I would never be a child again and, although I was truly grateful to be alive, I also felt that I had died."" The court also heard from Pete Schultze, who was just 11 years old when DeAngelo broke into his home and raped his mother. He said that DeAngelo stole his mother's wedding ring, other jewellery and money as part of the 1976 attack. ""But he did not steal the happiness, dreams and spirit of our family,"" Mr Schultze said, addressing DeAngelo in court this week. ""Your suffering, sir, has just begun,"" he said. ""The boogeyman is gone."" A woman holds a photo of Cheri Domingo and her boyfriend Gregory Sanchez, who were murdered in their California home in 1981 In a one-page letter released on Thursday, DeAngelo's ex-wife Sharon Huddle also testified. ""The defendant's criminal actions have had a devastating and pervasive affect on my life and my family,"" Ms Huddle wrote. ""I will never be the same person. I now live everyday with the knowledge of how he attacked and severely damaged hundreds of innocent people's lives."" Ms Huddle wrote that she had trusted her husband, to be ""doing what he said he told me he was doing"" - working late, pheasant hunting, or taking trips hundreds of miles away. ""I have lost my ability to trust people,"" she wrote. The pair had been separated when DeAngelo was arrested in 2018 and their divorce was finalised a year later.

"This video can not be played Landslip train had reached almost 73mph The train which derailed in Aberdeenshire, leaving three men dead, had reached almost 73mph before it hit a landslip, a report has said. Driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died near Stonehaven. Six others were injured. The train derailed following heavy rain last week. An initialreport by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch,externalsaid the train was travelling within the speed limit. The RAIB said it reached 72.8 mph (117.1 km/h) and this was ""within the maximum permitted of 75 mph (120 km/h) on this stretch of line"". Minute's silence honours train crash victims Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment The report confirms that the accident took place at about 09:38, just a few minutes before the first reports reached the emergency services. Investigators said all six vehicles of the train derailed after it struck the landslip 1.4 miles north-east of Carmont in Aberdeenshire. Nine people were on board, a crew of three and six passengers. Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury died after the train left the tracks Describing conditions at the time of the crash, the RAIB said there had been thunderstorms in the area, with 52mm (2in) of rain falling within the space of four hours. This is about 70% of the total monthly rainfall which could be expected in Aberdeenshire in August. The high speed train - with two power cars and four carriages - had been operating the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow. It was initially stopped at Carmont at 06:59, after a northbound train reported a landslip further south, on the section of track between Carmont and Laurencekirk. After sitting at Carmont for more than two hours, it was decided to move the train back to Stonehaven, to allow passengers to get off. The driver was given permission to move north at 09:25, moving at 5mph initially as it crossed on to the northbound track, but then accelerating to 72.8mph. The investigators said that, after it was derailed by the landslip, the train continued for 77 yards (70 metres) before hitting the parapet of a bridge. The train came off the tracks as it attempted to return to Stonehaven The report states: ""The leading power car continued most of the way over the bridge and fell from the railway down a wooded embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, having rotated to be almost at right angles to the track. ""The second passenger carriage also overturned on to its roof and came to rest on the first carriage. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and attached to the rear power car; it also came to rest on the first carriage. All wheelsets of the rear power car derailed, but it remained upright."" The RAIB says its detailed investigation will include: The sequence of events and the actions of those involved The operating procedures applied The management of earthworks and drainage in this area, including recent inspections and risk assessments The general management of earthworks and drainage and associated procedures designed to manage the risk of extreme weather events The behaviour of the train during, and following the derailment The consequences of the derailment and a review of the damage caused to the rolling stock The investigation carried out by the RAIB is independent of parallel work being carried out by the rail industry, and of the investigation being undertaken by the police under the instruction of the Lord Advocate. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: ""My thoughts remain with the families and friends of Brett, Donald and Christopher, and everybody else affected by the tragic events of last week. Our railway family is still in shock. ""We are doing everything we can to support ongoing investigations so that we can properly establish the circumstances that led to the derailment, and to understand what can be done to prevent such a tragedy again."" A one-minute silence was held at railway stations on Wednesday across the UK to honour the three men killed. Family members of the men who lost their lives were among those who gathered at Aberdeen station. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Minute's silence honours train crash victims Derailment relatives gather for one minute silence.

"Bletchley Park was once top secret but now is a museum open to the public A museum at Bletchley Park, site of the World War Two code-breaking success, is to cut up to a third of its jobs after losing almost all of its income during lockdown. Up to 35 jobs at all levels and in each department are said to be at risk. Chief executive officer Iain Standen said the Bletchley Park Trust had ""exhausted all other avenues"". Workers at the Buckinghamshire site were responsible for decoding enemy codes during the war. Thesite became a museum in 1994,external. The Duchess of Cambridge opened the refurbished museum in 2014 - her paternal grandmother worked at Bletchley during the war The trust, which has 118 employees, expects to lose Â£2m in income this year. When the coronavirus lockdown began, it furloughed 85% of its staff and managed to secure some additional funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. It closed on 19 March and reopened on 4 July, although with reduced visitor numbers due to social distancing. Savings have been made by reducing marketing, new exhibitions, travel, IT and printing costs, but this only helps in the short term, according to the trust. Mr Standen said: ""The economic impact of the current crisis is having a profound effect on the trust's ability to survive. Bletchley Park intelligence is credited with shortening the war and saving lives. By 1945, the majority of its 9,000 staff were women ""We have exhausted all other avenues, and we need to act now to ensure he trust survives and is sustainable in the future.""

"PSG fans gathered in Paris to celebrate their Champions League semi-final win A ban on Paris Saint-Germain fans wearing their team's shirt in the city centre of fierce rivals Marseille on Sunday has been rescinded. Police had announced the ban for when the Parisians take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. Clothing even ""displaying the colours of PSG"" was off-limits. But the order was later rolled back after the decision was met with widespread criticism. Justifying its initial ban, the police said ""there is strong animosity on the part of some Marseille residents, supporters or not, toward the PSG team, in contradiction with any sporting spirit"". The order came due to disturbances in Marseille during PSG'ssemi-final win over German side Leipzig. One man was arrested for attacking a man wearing a PSG shirt. Hundreds of Marseille fans sang anti-PSG songs and detonated firecrackers. But Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne police later backtracked on the order. ""The sole purpose of this decree was to protect Parisian supporters, and in no way intended to restrict freedom of movement,"" it said on Twitter. It added that it had decided to repeal the total ban on PSG fans due to the ""incomprehension caused by this decree"". The PSG-Bayern game takes place at Benfica's stadium in Lisbon.

"The glasses had been worn by Gandhi on a trip to South Africa A pair of Mahatma Gandhi's glasses have sold for Â£260,000 after they were found sticking halfway out of an auction house's letterbox. The spectacles were bought through a phone bid from an American collector after six minutes of bidding on Friday. Auctioneer Andrew Stowe said it was a new record for East Bristol Auctions and described it as ""the star lot of the century"". The glasses had been expected to sell for about Â£15,000. Mr Stowe said the owner of the glasses was an elderly man from Mangotsfield who said he would split the money with his daughter. They had been handed down from generation to generation in the owner's family, after a relative met Gandhi on a visit to South Africa in the 1920s. The Indian civil rights leader was known for giving his possessions away, the auctioneer said ""It's a phenomenal result. These glasses represent not only an auction record for us, but a find of international historical importance,"" Mr Stowe said. The glasses had been left in a plain white envelope in a letter box at East Bristol Auctions on a Friday night and were not collected until the following Monday morning. ""They could quite easily have been stolen or fallen out or just ended up in the bin,"" Mr Stowe continued. He said the owner had no idea of their value and ""nearly had a heart attack"" when he was told they might be worth Â£15,000. ""These glasses have been lying in a drawer for the best part of fifty years. The vendor literally told me to throw them away if they were 'no good'. Now he gets a life-changing sum of money.""

"During lockdown many people have been running in parks and on beaches A number of small-scale outdoor theatre and sporting events will be trialled in Wales as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Events were cancelled when lockdown began in March, and mass gatherings were banned. Now First Minister Mark Drakeford has said three outdoor events, with up to 100 people, will be held in the hope more would be allowed. But he said the reopening of schools in September remained the ""top priority"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's press briefing, Mr Drakeford said parents could be reassured that children would be able to go back to the classroom. He said that keeping schools open would be the priority when deciding measures to combat the virus, if cases were to increase in Wales. ""We are putting the successful and safe reopening for schools right at the top of our agenda,"" he added. This video can not be played What's it like to run the whole of the Welsh coast - in just 20 days? Numerous mass-participation events, which raise millions of pounds for charities, including marathons and triathlons, were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic, while festivals and concerts were also put on hold. Mr Drakeford said three events would be trialled to see if they could be carried out in a ""safe way"" while maintaining social distancing. The trial will see outdoor performances run by Theatr Clwyd, in Flintshire, allowed from 27 August. Tamara Harvey, the artistic director of the theatre, said: ""It's brilliant, because not only does it mean that we can start bringing people back up the hill, but we can also share all that we're learning with other venues across Wales."" The Return to Racing triathlon at Pembrey Country Park, Carmarthenshire, will also go ahead, but without spectators, and a car rally at Trac Mon, on Anglesey, has also been allowed. Mr Drakeford said the hope was to support the sector and ""make the most of the remaining summer months where we can spend time outdoors"". The first minister said the government was learning from trials of reopening indoor theatre and some indoor sports in other parts of the UK, and it was possible other activities would resume later in the autumn. Indoor visits to care homes are set to be allowed from a week Saturday It was also announced that relatives would be able to visit their loved ones in care homes from 29 August, under ""strict"" rules to be set out. Mr Drakeford said this was one of the ""most serious decisions"" taken by Welsh Government. ""I know that there will be many families and many residents that this will make an enormous difference,"" he added. ""But care homes are such vulnerable places that it's right we take a different level of caution before we allow those visits to take place."" In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford warned ""it won't be like it was before"". ""People won't simply be able to turn up, they will need to make sure that they made the arrangement in advance,"" he said. ""It's likely to be a single visitor, the care home will have to carry out a risk assessment."" Casinos will also be able to reopen on 29 August, provided cases remain low Casinos will also be allowed to reopen on the same date, with both moves subject to coronavirus remaining under control. Mr Drakeford confirmedup to four households will be able to join togetherin an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" from this weekend. Currently, an extended householdcan only be made up of two households, but from Saturday that cap will double. A meal following a wedding, civil partnership or funeral will also be allowed for up to 30 people indoors, if social distancing can be maintained, from 22 August. Mr Drakeford said the next easing of lockdown measures, in three weeks' time, would include relaxing rules to allow cleaners and tutors to work in people's homes. It would also allow small groups to meet indoors for classes and clubs, such as book clubs and weight loss groups. Mr Drakeford said 500 businesses had been closed since March after breaking coronavirus regulations. He said incidents had been witnessed and reported to the police and local authorities ""which are plainly not within the rules"". Earlier he said things ""continue to improve"" in Wales, but the picture across the UK was ""challenging"". Mark Drakeford: ""We will continue to talk with event organisers about the possible resumption of some other activities later in the autumn"" Asked about the difference in infection rates between Wales and England, Mr Drakeford said population density was ""part of the explanation"" but ""it may not be the whole of the explanation"". ""I do think that some of what we are seeing is the result of the way that we have done things in Wales,"" he said. ""I'm not going to claim that it's the whole of the reason, luck comes into this as well as good planning. ""But the way we've tried to do things in Wales, step-by-step, trying not to do too many things at once, trying to make sure that you can have a sense of cause and effect in what you are doing, being willing to do it in a cautious, controlled way."" This video can not be played Nearly one-fifth of residents at the home died in the space of a month Karen Healey, general manager of Tregwilym Lodge nursing and residential home in Rogerstone, Newport, said she was ""slightly tentative"" about opening the care home to visitors, as 21 residents had died from Covid-19 up to the end of June. ""Although we will be opening our home up, we will have to do in a staged approach because, quite clearly, what we can't afford is to open up the home and to cause another pandemic,"" she said. ""We are also very mindful that there could be a second wave coming. I have a duty to protect my staff and, more importantly, my residents."" Lee Dirkzwager, 72, from Cardiff, who has been shielding, said: ""I did venture out on Sunday, very tentatively, quite nervous actually.

"US actor John David Washington plays a character known as The Protagonist Christopher Nolan is that rare beast: an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning. Ridley Scott had the same knack, as did Stanley Kubrick: the wit to combine a vivid imagination with unabashed showmanship in order to explore complex ideas such as time and space and consciousness in the context of an epic, all-action movie. To this, Nolan adds a mastery of mixing genres. Inception was a sci-fi-heist movie, The Dark Knight a comic-book thriller. He's at it again with Tenet, which is a globe-trotting sci-fi-spy drama starring John David Washington as The Protagonist, who is given the not insignificant task of saving humanity from certain radioactive Armageddon in a looming World War III. It's a big ask, but arguably not as big a challenge as the one Nolan has been set with Tenet - which is basically to save the world of cinema from the potentially terminal twin threats of streaming giants and Covid-19. It's a combination of an unseen, mutating enemy and an insurgent fifth column, which, in terms of themes, sounds like a Nolan movie. He hasn't shirked his responsibilities. Tenet is the first major film to be screened in cinemas since the coronavirus outbreak Tenet is a big movie (shot on a mixture of Imax cameras and 70mm film) with a big budget (reported at around $200m/Â£153m), which is designed to be seen on the big screen. It is a piece of what is now called ""event"" cinema, an immersive experience to stimulate all the senses, which it does, from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's throbbing Wagnerian score to visual effects company DNEG's eye-boggling CGI. In terms of spectacle, Tenet delivers. The stunts, the camera work and the scale are impressive. As is Nolan's appetite to use blockbuster entertainment as a platform to seriously consider existential threats, the unconscious mind, and cutting-edge physics. In the past, he's given us esoteric stories of implanted dreams (Inception) and alternative universes (Interstellar), both of which felt more like fiction than science. That's not the case with Tenet, in which Nolan - who is both writer and director - grapples with the concept of time in a manner that made the incredible seem credible. Frankly, there's a lot to get your head around. The clue is in the movie's title, which not only refers to the ethical codes of conduct (tenets) expected by the ultra-secret society into which Washington's Protagonist has unwittingly been inducted, but also to its palindromic form, an allusion to the way in which Nolan is asking us to think about time. That is, it goes both ways - forwards and backwards, sometimes simultaneously. The upshot of which being, events that occur in the future can be revisited in the past, an idea illustrated in the Grandfather Paradox, which posits if a person travels back in time and kills their own grandfather before his or her parents were conceived, it would prevent the time-traveller's existence. Nolan has previously directed Inception, Memento, Interstellar, Dunkirk and The Dark Knight That's at the easier end of the temporal concepts Nolan has us grapple with, which include entropy reversal, time inversion, temporal pincer movements, and reverse cryogenology (I might have misheard that one). If that all sounds a tad complicated, you should try showing it on film. There are car chases in which The Protagonist is going forwards when all else is in reverse, fist fights that take place over millennia but happen in the same time and space, and bullets that seal rather than penetrate. Critics laud Nolan's 'mind-bending wonder' Nolan is challenging our preconceptions of time and suggesting there might be an alternative way of looking at it beyond a limited notion of linear progression. It's confusing to begin with, but by about mid-way through the film starts to make narrative sense, to such an extent that plot twists at the end are rather predictable (or, maybe that's some super clever meta-narrative device that validates the film's conceptual argument). In fact, the entire plot is rather predictable, which I suppose makes room for all the thinky physics stuff. It's a Bond-like set-up. The Protagonist is the goodie: a Western agent working for a morally sound, state-backed, above-the-board secret service. The baddie is Andrei Sator, an unscrupulous Russian businessman played with great vigour but not a lot of subtlety by Kenneth Branagh. Kenneth Branagh as Andrei Sator He is married to the glamorous Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), a British art expert working for an international auction house, who foolishly gave her husband a fake Goya: a professional and personal misjudgement that has allowed the evil Andrei to blackmail her into not leaving him. Unless, that is, she agrees never to see their little son Max (Laurie Shepherd) ever again, thereby depriving her of the joy of picking him up from his posh north London prep school. Elizabeth Debicki, recently cast as Princess Diana in The Crown, plays Kat Andrei is hell-bent on putting together the wherewithal to erase the past, present and future of the world. The Protagonist is heaven-sent to stop him. Kat is the key, a love triangle plot device that might work on paper but doesn't in the film where there is little emotional spark or screen chemistry between her and either Andrei or The Protagonist - or Max for that matter. You're left wondering why the two men are willing to stake everything that has ever been or will ever be on a bit of a cold fish with whom neither appear remotely enamoured. I'm not sure why there is such an apparent lack of connection between the main players. Maybe it's the script, or possibly that the characters are too simplified, although Washington does a good job in fleshing out The Protagonist, as does Robert Pattinson in his role as an English adventurer type, Neil. Perhaps it's the high-definition filming and extreme close-ups, which show every pore in the actors' skin, that leads to some scenes having a mannered awkwardness. Robert Pattinson, best known for Twilight, and John David Washington To that extent, it's certainly not Bond, but then, it's not not Bond either. There are action sequences with Bond-like levels of spectacle, and interior scenes in which you sense The Protagonist actively putting his tanks on 007's lawn with his own bone-dry quips (asked how he would like to die, he replies: ""Old""). What differentiates Tenet are the bigger ideas in which Nolan is framing his story. It turns what could have been a sub-Bond action-packed spy movie into an inventive, bold and thought-provoking interrogation into our perception of time. It won't leave you shaken, but your mind will be stirred. And that has to be worth a trip to the cinema. Tenet is released in the UK on Wednesday, 26 August.

"Sky's call centre is based in Cardiff's new Capital Quarter in Butetown Call centre workers are self-isolating in Cardiff after testing positive for coronavirus. Sky confirmed three staff members at its contact centre had Covid-19 and the building had been closed on Friday. It comes as Public Health Wales figures confirmed 14 new cases in Cardiff, the highest figure in 11 weeks. Sky said safety was its top priority and it had a robust contact tracing programme in place. Back in March, the office onCapital Quarter on Tyndall Street was evacuated and shut for deep cleaning after concerns about a worker. ""We are closing the contact centre today and sending everyone homeâ¯as a precaution,"" a spokesman said. ""We're contacting anyone who has been in contact with our colleagues, the centre itself has recently been deep cleaned and will be deep cleaned again over the weekend."" How many people have died with coronavirus? Three staff positive for Covid-19 at Wetherspoon On Friday, Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed out of the 34 new confirmed cases, 14 - the highest number - were in Cardiff, with the next highest number being in Caerphilly, with four cases. The last time the daily number in the capital area was at that level was at the start of June. A PHW spokesperson confirmed an investigation was ""ongoing into a small number of cases at a Sky call centre in Cardiff"". ""As we move into the recovery phase of the coronavirus pandemic, we expect to see clusters in settings such as workplaces,"" the spokesperson said. ""We manage any clusters of coronavirus appropriately, including by providing advice around infection prevention and control, and by supporting contact tracing where required."" Speaking toGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales, Robin Howe from PHW urged younger people to follow the guidelines. He said: ""It's not so much a statistical blip as a number of small clusters which are being brought under control and the public can do their bit by following the guidance. ""It looks like cases at the moment are most commonly within the 20 to 29-year-olds age group, so we'd make a plea for younger people to please don't go mad and try and follow all that guidance around social distancing and handwashing etc."" Cardiff call centre worker has coronavirus Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors treating Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who fell into a coma after being taken ill on a plane, have changed their minds and agreed to let him be flown to Germany. The doctors, in the Siberian city of Omsk, had earlier insisted he was too ill to be moved. His supporters suspect he drank poisoned tea, and accuse authorities of trying to cover up a crime. A medically equipped plane is waiting to take him to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny's team said earlier it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital and his wife, Yulia, appealed in a letter to the Kremlin to give permission for him to flown abroad. Eventually, German medics were allowed to see him and said they were ""able and willing"" to fly him to Berlin. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said it was a pity doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Reports say he could leave within hours, but Mr Navalny's spokeswoman said his departure would not happen for at least seven hours - which would be early on Saturday morning in the Siberian city. Mr Navalny remains in a coma and hospital head doctor Alexander Murakhovsky warned late on Friday they did not recommend flying,""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility."" Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the CharitÃ© hospital was ready to treat him. ""They can fly him, we are willing,"" it told the BBC. ""The circumstances and equipment make it possible."" At a news conference in Berlin, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany have been allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembles the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 When Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media purported to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Further footage showed him being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway at Omsk.

Saundersfoot harbour master David Richards said such behaviour puts ""strain"" on the emergency services. On Friday hundreds of homes were left without power in south Wales, seven flood warnings were issued and there was significant disruption to travel. A campsite owner in Pembrokeshire said he had ""never seen anything like this"" in August. Gusts of up to 95mph (153km/h) forced the closure of the M48 Severn Bridge, and a 30mph speed limit was in place on the A55 Britannia Bridge.

A maple tree came down at the Apple Camping site in Tenby Demand for campsites was still high, says Toby Rhys-Davies But it has not deterred the ""sort of person who wants to batten down the hatches"", he added. ""We did have a couple just leave, but another couple just got in touch - there are those who are not put off because there are so few campsites. ""We have been turning away 30 people a day.""

"A series of massive fires in northern and central California forced more evacuations California is struggling to contain huge wildfires burning forests and homes, warned Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday as more than 12,000 fire-fighters battled blazes that have killed six people. Help was on its way from several US states as Gov Newsom put in a plea for assistance from Australia and Canada. ""These fires are stretching our resources, our personnel,"" he said. Among the 560 fires are some of the largest the state has seen. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reachedwhat could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded. By Friday, emergency officials said some of the fires had doubled in size in a day, forcing 175,000 residents to flee. Two fires are now the 7th and 10th largest in the state's history, Gov Newsom said as he urged President Donald Trump to sign a major disaster declaration. The CZU Lightning Complex fire destroyed homes in Davenport, California The worst are in the mountains to the south and east of San Francisco. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. Many blazes are burning on steep, difficult-to-access terrain and have been fuelled by strong winds. The fires are also threatening larger towns including Santa Cruz where flames reached within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus, reports Reuters news agency. More fire=fighters, engines and surveillance planes are racing in from other states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas to help. Assistance from what Gov Newsom called ""the world's best wildfire-fighters"" in Australia has been requested. ""We simply haven't seen anything like this in many, many years,"" he said, adding that an area the size of the US state of Rhode Island had already burned within California. Redwoods, the tallest trees in the world, have caught fire near their eponymous state park With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. One woman told CNN she had been forced to flee to a community centre in Vacaville but was refusing to go inside for fear of catching coronavirus. ""Not only are we dealing with Covid, but with also the heat and now the fires,"" said Cheryl Jarvis, who said she was currently sleeping in her Toyota Prius. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Wash your hands often Keep six feet of distance from anyone not among your household Wear a face covering when possible, and if possible, wash it regularly Avoid sharing food and drinks Frequently disinfect your area in the shelter (including toys and electronics) Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature. Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. In another pandemic twist, officials also advise that people remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing an electricity strain, which has caused a rolling blackout for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts. In total, more than 1,205 square miles (3,121 sq km) have burned across the state. A mother and daughter in an evacuation centre in Vacaville Satellite images show smoke blanketing nearly all of California, as well most of Nevada and southern Idaho. Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park and home to redwood trees that are 2,000 years old, sustained extensive damage to historic buildings. Firefighting teams are stretched thin across the state and have been forced to work longer shifts than usual. A volunteer firefighting corps made up of state prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, has been diminished this year due to the pandemic. Fires have burned through parts of California's wine-producing regions President Trump blamed California for the fires, and threatened to withhold federal funding ashe repeated a suggestion that was met with bemusement when he first raised it in 2018. Speaking to supporters in Pennsylvania on Thursday, he said he had told state officials: ""You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests â there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up."" ""I've been telling them this now for three years, but they don't want to listen,"" he said. ""'The environment, the environment,' but they have massive fires again.""

"People will still be able to go shopping and go to work Oldham and parts of Blackburn and Pendle are facing extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19. Residents in those areas are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household, as of midnight on Saturday. Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including restaurants and pubs, will remain open. Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions after a spike in coronavirus cases. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list, and Northampton named an""area of intervention"". People will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel But tighter rules in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale are to be dropped on 26 August. Wigan and Rossendale originally faced tighter restrictions along with the rest of Greater Manchester and east Lancashire because of the wider region's overall infection rate and concerns that the virus was being spread between households. However, both have maintained low infection rates compared with other areas. The additional measures in Oldham and parts of Pendle and Blackburn will not prevent people from shopping, going to work or attending child-care settings including schools, which open from 1 September. However, any social activities indoors and outdoors can only be shared with people you live with and are in your immediate household. Residents will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel, and the number of people who can attend weddings, civil partnerships and funerals will be limited to household members and close family, with no more than 20 people. Restaurants will also be encouraged to halt walk-ins, and only seat people who make reservations in advance. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""To prevent a second peak and keep Covid-19 under control, we need robust, targeted intervention where we see a spike in cases. ""Our approach is to make the action we take as targeted as possible, with the maximum possible local consensus."" This will allow local councils to focus resources on the wards that need more targeted intervention, he added. The new restrictions on household gatherings and socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where all restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Existing restrictions in Pendle remain but the new rules apply to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden Councillor Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, welcomed the announcement the town would not face business closures. ""Over the last few days we've made a clear argument that an economic lockdown was not the answer for Oldham,"" he said. ""Instead we put forward a strong case to [the] government for a different approach - one where we increase testing, use our powers to drive compliance and enforcement among those not currently following guidelines, and carry out intensive door-to-door engagement in areas with higher cases."" He added that he believed the tightened measures would ""help reduce the spread of the virus"". Tightened Covid-19 measures have been imposed in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn Greater Manchester Metro Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""I think we've come to a sensible agreement with the government and I'm grateful to them for listening. ""We didn't want to see a lockdown in Oldham and we are pleased the government worked with us on that one - and we are glad the restrictions have been lifted in Wigan."" Mr Burnham added that he wanted to see ""further relaxation"" in Greater Manchester next week as  ""we are also seeing cases coming down in Trafford and Stockport"". ""We are balancing protecting people against letting people live their lives - it is a really difficult question and I don't envy the government on this one,"" he said. With the exception of Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have the highest rate of new infections. They are seeing between 70 and 90 cases per 100,000 people. That is about half the rate Leicester was in when it was put into lockdown. This move is about taking pre-emptive action before infections spiral out of control. What testing shows is that in these places - and a number of other areas in the north west and West Yorkshire for that matter - there is community transmission, often focussed in specific neighbourhoods. Northampton, which has the highest rate, is quite different as the cases are largely linked to a workplace. But alongside these extra restrictions, there is also a great deal of work being done that does not get the headlines. Council staff working hand-in-hand with community groups are knocking on doors, encouraging residents to get tested and stay safe. To help with this, extra testing facilities are opening up. The targeted testing of people in high infection areas who are not ill is also beginning - one of the major difficulties in fighting this virus is that significant numbers do not show symptoms. But one issue that keeps cropping up is how to get people to isolate when they have mild symptoms and staying at home means they do not get paid. Many on the ground say this needs to be resolved urgently. The spike in Northampton was ""almost solely down to an outbreak linked to the workforce at the Greencore Factory"", a Department for Health spokesperson said. Nearly 300 workers have tested positive, and employees and their households are required to isolate at home for two weeks. The number of cases has also been ""rising quickly"" in Birmingham, where the majority of new cases have been among those aged between 18 and 34, a government spokesperson said. The city recorded about 30 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. It has been categorised as an 'area of enhanced support', which means it will get additional testing, more local contact tracing, and targeted community engagement. The mayor of the West Midlands believes ""some people have not been strict enough"" with coronavirus measures. Andy Street said the city wasin ""an extremely challenging situation"".,external Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward added that the watch list should be a ""wake-up call for everyone"".

"Dr Tedros said globalisation had allowed the virus to spread more quickly The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he hopes the coronavirus pandemic will be over in under two years. Speaking in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Spanish flu of 1918 had taken two years to overcome. But he added that current advances in technology could enable the world to halt the virus ""in a shorter time"". ""Of course with more connectiveness, the virus has a better chance of spreading,"" he said. ""But at the same time, we have also the technology to stop it, and the knowledge to stop it,"" he noted, stressing the importance of ""national unity, global solidarity"". The flu of 1918 killed at least 50 million people. Coronavirus has so far killed 800,000 people. Nearly 23 million infections have been recorded but the number of people who have actually had the virus is thought to be much higher due to inadequate testing and asymptomatic cases. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - on Saturday said that Covid-19 was ""going to be with us forever in some form or another"". ""So, a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals,"" he told the BBC. What can we learn from the Spanish Flu? How they tried to curb a pandemic in 1918 In Geneva, Dr Tedros said corruption related to supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic was ""unacceptable"", describing it as ""murder"". ""If health workers work without PPE, we're risking their lives. And that also risks the lives of the people they serve,"" he added, in response to a question. Although the question related to allegations of corruption in South Africa, a number of countries have faced similar issues. On Friday, protests were held in the Kenyan capital Nairobi over alleged corruption during the pandemic, while doctors from a number of the city's public hospitals went on strike over unpaid wages and a lack of protective equipment. A demonstration took place in Nairobi on Friday The same day, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme warned the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in Mexico was ""clearly under-recognised"". Dr Mike Ryan said the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico, compared with about 150 per 100,000 people in the US. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? In the US, Democratic nominee Joe Biden pledged to introduce a national mandate to wear masks if elected, and attacked President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic. ""Our current president's failed in his most basic duty to the nation. He's failed to protect us. He's failed to protect America,"" Mr Biden said. More than 1,000 new deaths were announced in the US on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 173,490. On Friday, a number of countries announced their highest numbers of new cases in months. South Korea recorded 324 new cases - its highest single-day total since March. As with its previous outbreak, the new infections have been linked to churches, andmuseums, nightclubs and karaoke bars have now been closed in and around the capital Seoulin response. This video can not be played Another church, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, was identified earlier this year as South Korea's biggest virus cluster A number of European countries are also seeing rises. Poland and Slovakia both announced record new daily infections on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain and France have seen dramatic increases in recent days. Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave In Lebanon, a two-week partial lockdown - including a night-time curfew - has come into effectas the country saw its highest number of cases since the pandemic began. This video can not be played Why has there been crisis after crisis in Lebanon? Infections have doubled since a devastating blast in the capital Beirut killed at least 178 people and injured thousands more on 4 August. The disaster left an estimated 300,000 people homeless and placed massive strain on medical facilities. In Africa, the average daily cases of coronavirus fell last week, in what the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr John Nkengasong, described as a ""sign of hope"". The continent-wide daily average was 10,300 last week, down from 11,000 the week before. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

"Tightened Covid-19 measures have already been imposed in Oldham A local lockdown in Oldham could prove ""catastrophic for business"", the council leader has warned. Labour councillor Sean Fielding urged the government not to impose stricter measures in the town. Oldham has one of the highest rates of new infections in England and is one of the areas currently subjected totightened coronavirus restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""There is a big challenge in Oldham, the numbers are clear about that."" Mr Fielding told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his council was ""strongly making the case"" that a local lockdown ""would not be the right solution for the wave of the pandemic that we're seeing"". He said ""household transmission"" was driving infections in the Greater Manchester town, most cases were among the working-age population, and there had been little increase in hospital admissions or deaths. ""We already have youth unemployment of 9.5% and 15% of unemployment generally so [a local lockdown] would be really, really catastrophic for businesses and for the working-age population in Oldham,"" he added. ""It's different to Leicester because Leicester never really properly reopened."" By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Oldham currently has one of the highest rates of new infections in England, although it is some way below the figures that were being recorded in Leicester when its own tightened lockdown was imposed. In the week to last Friday, 14 August, Oldham recorded 225 cases, one more than the week before and a rate of 95 per 100,000 population. The average was 28 new cases each day. Leicester's restrictionswere imposed at the end of Juneand Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at that time its seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people. Local figures for Oldham show the greatest concentration of new cases came from the Alexandra Park area, with 44 recorded in the week to 14 August based on the data released on Tuesday evening. Another 33 were recorded in Werneth. Mr Fielding warned that hundreds of businesses in Oldham had made themselves ""Covid-secure, spent money in doing so, reopened, traded for a short time"". ""The likelihood is many of those having done all of that would simply not be able to reopen once the restrictions are lifted again,"" he added. But Mr Hancock did not rule out a local lockdown, telling BBC News ""we will do what is necessary"". ""There is a big challenge in Oldham, the numbers are clear about that,"" he said. ""We see from what's happened in Leicester over the past few weeks that where we put a local lockdown in place it then has been effective."" Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said he would be writing to Mr Hancock, arguing there is ""no case"" to impose further restrictions on the town. He said enhanced Covid-19 measures in Greater Manchester were working and that the ""highly targeted, proportionate"" approach should be continued. Oldham brings in extra virus measures Residents react to new Covid-19 measures  ""So there is certainly no case today to impose further restrictions on Oldham beyond the prohibition of social gatherings in the home,"" Mr Burnham said. He is also calling for businesses such as beauty parlours and casinos to be permitted to reopen across Greater Manchester, except in Oldham, in line with an easing of cornavirus restrictions in England. Meanwhile, Labour MP Jim McMahon wrote to Mr Hancock asking for a further two weeks to see the impact of local interventions without the ""blunt tool"" of a lockdown. The letter, which the MP for Oldham West and Royton posted on Twitter,  was co-signed by fellow local MP Debbie Abrahams and Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Oldham Council has enlisted the help ofGame Of Thrones actor James Cosmo to warn residents,externalthat ""lockdown is coming"" unless they abide by coronavirus guidelines.

"This video can not be played Beirut blast: The families whose lives changed forever Lebanon will impose a two-week lockdown to contain a surge in coronavirus infections following the devastating explosion in Beirut two weeks ago. Markets, shopping centres, gyms and pools will have to close from Friday and there will be an overnight curfew. Officials reported a record 456 new cases of Covid-19 and two deaths on Monday, and 421 cases on Tuesday. Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan has warned that hospitals are rapidly running out of space for new patients. ""The situation is unbearable,"" he told a local radio station on Monday. 'This can never be allowed to happen again' The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images What we know about the blast Six major hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage as a result of the huge blast at Beirut's port, which killed at least 178 people. Those medical facilities still functioning and field hospitals are treating thousands of patients for trauma and burns, as well as those more seriously injured. An estimated 300,000 people were also left homeless by the blast. Many are now living in damaged buildings, temporary sites or shared shelters, with limited access to water and sanitation. The disaster added to an already critical situation faced by Lebanon due to a severe economic downturn that has been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that Lebanon had done a ""very impressive job"" of tackling the coronavirus, which has killed at least 107 people in the country since February. However, before the blast there had been an upward trend in the daily numbers of new cases and the government had planned a partial lockdown to help manage hospitals' caseloads. Transmission rates have since increased and are expected to further increase in the coming weeks, as many people have been unable to follow precautionary measures, such as social distancing. Six major hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage The UN is concerned about the high risk of exposure for health workers,externaldue to overcrowding in hospital emergency departments; shortages of personal protection equipment (PPE); increased population vulnerability; and reduced numbers of beds and intensive care unit capacity. It has said the procurement of tests and community-based surveillance among newly displaced people is critical, as is the distribution of PPE and disinfection and hygiene supplies to vulnerable groups. The WHO has shipped almost 25 tonnes of PPE to Beirut and the Lebanese health ministry has established clinics to conduct Covid-19 tests in two of the areas worst affected by the explosion. Overseas medical teams have also been asked by the WHO to repurpose their field hospitals to boost capacity for treating coronavirus patients.

"Spain saw one of the most draconian Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe, but two months after it was lifted, the virus is spreading faster than in any neighbouring nation. It now has Europe's fastest-rising caseload, with 142 positive cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks. By the time the state of emergency ended on 21 June, Spain was registering 100 to 150 cases per day. That number has risen to more than 3,000. But the number of deaths over the past week stood at 122 on Thursday, a far cry from the 950 registered on 2 April alone, the blackest day in Europe's deadliest per capita coronavirus epidemic. Most of the transmission is now between young people, and around three-quarters of positives are in patients who show no symptoms. Spain's government admits the numbers are ""not what we want to see"", but points to key differences compared to the spring. Only around 3% of current cases require hospital treatment, less than 0.5% need intensive care and the current death rate is as low as 0.3%. ""Mortality is very low, as is the hospitalisation rate. Something has changed big time, although the rise is still worrying,"" says Ildefonso HernÃ¡ndez, a professor in public health from Miguel HernÃ¡ndez University in Alicante. ""As long as cases are rising, we have to think that a second wave is on the way. We don't have much time to react before September's return to routines."" This video can not be played Magaluf's famous party streets are now like a ghost town Spain's tourism season has ended up as little more than a damp squib, as most countries moved to blacklist this key destination within weeks of the country opening up at the end of June. That means beach areas have so far avoided the highest rates of infection, althoughCatalonia's infection rate is slightly above the national average on 145 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Healthcare is a competence of Spain's 17 regions, and some are looking much better prepared than others. At the good end of the scale, the northern region ofAsturiashas an infection rate of 32, whileAragÃ³nin the north-east is topping 500. AragÃ³n's capital, Zaragoza, has become a hotspot for community transmission over recent weeks, but the problems began in the early summer when thousands of seasonal workers, many of them wandering migrants, began to travel to orchards in the region. Growers and packing companies have been criticised for not providing accommodation for migrant workers, leading them to travel between shelters and fields or subsist in insanitary shanties. ""Everything happening in AragÃ³n is very much connected to outbreaks among the seasonal fruit-pickers. There should have been more anticipation of the problems that could arise due to the accommodation situation of these workers,"" explains Juan GonzÃ¡lez Armengol, president of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (Semes). Worst of all, more than 55 care homes for the elderly in AragÃ³n have registered cases since the end of the state of emergency. This team disinfected a nursing home for the elderly in the city of Teruel in early August There is a risk that areas that escaped the worst ravages of the spring pandemic could be hit by a second wave as autumn nears. In June, AragÃ³n estimated around 760 deaths in residences, 10 times fewer than in Madrid. Spanish politics has lacked any consensus or spirit of collaboration in managing the coronavirus crisis. While the national government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has faced accusations from rivals of lying about death rates, the regional government in Madrid run by the conservative Popular Party has attracted equally fierce criticism. Despite a shocking collapse of Madrid's public hospital system in the spring, and with 50% more deaths than the more populous region of Catalonia, the capital is now seeing cases double week after week. Madridâs medical heroes in fight of their lives Spanish regions ban smoking over Covid-19 risk Spain's holiday islands shake off party image Waiting for tourists on Spain's Costa del Sol Madrid had fewer than 200 contact tracers by the end of July. Double that number had been promised, and even that was half the figure recommended by the medical community. This video can not be played Watch as anti-mask protesters take to the streets of Madrid ""Among the factors for the high infection numbers we are seeing, the quality of Spain's democracy is playing a part. Were accountability stricter, it would not be acceptable that some regions - and not just Madrid - are taking so long to put measures in place,"" says Prof HernÃ¡ndez. Officially, 28,813 have died from Covid-19 - Spain's health ministry counts only those who tested positive for the virus According to excess death statistics, close to 44,596 are believed to have died from the illness The Spanish government says more than 19,000 elderly people have died in care homes, although only around half have been included in the official death toll As infections surged, hospitals in many areas stopped sending ambulances to care homes, so residents died undiagnosed and often with very little treatment ""Never again can we leave our old people to die alone and afraid,"" said Ximena Di Lollo of Doctors Without Borders, which has criticised a lack of preparation and poor staffing levels. Inside story of Spain's care home tragedy For three months, Spaniards were under lockdown. That meant many young people were stuck in their family homes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, street parties and night life are now being signalled as the biggest catalysts of new outbreaks along with family gatherings. Town and city festivals have all been cancelled. That did not stop crowds gathering inNavarre's capital of Pamplona for the 7 July start date of the world-famous San FermÃ­n bull-running fiesta. The traditional running of the bulls was cancelled but these traditional singers turned up for the first day Last Friday 400 young revellers paraded the streets of nearby Tafalla, marking the town's ""non-festival"". In the neighbouringBasque Country, which is just ahead of Navarre as Spain's third worst-affected region this month, youthful gatherings have also been linked to outbreaks. Of the 350 people called to turn up for testing after a busy night at Bilbao's Back&Stage nightclub last month, at least 34 proved positive, the kind of result that has prompted an agreement between Spain's authorities to close down all nightlife after 01:00. ""It was like any other night at the club and many people were not wearing a face mask even when dancing. I was among the first to take mine off,"" 18-year-old Arkaitz Serrano told newspaper El PaÃ­s. In Madrid as well as the Basque Country alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings have deepened the problem ""Spaniards were extremely fastidious about following the rules during the lockdown, but there has been a massive relaxation now we have returned to a kind of normality,"" notes Prof HernÃ¡ndez. Under new emergency powers, the Basque government this week banned so-called botellÃ³n parties, alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings of young people. But the botellÃ³n is a national problem. In Madrid the regional government has asked for police reinforcements to seek out and break up such parties, whose numbers are rising as restrictions on nightclubs and bars take effect.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors treating Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who fell into a coma after being taken ill on a plane, have changed their minds and agreed to let him be flown to Germany. The doctors, in the Siberian city of Omsk, had earlier insisted he was too ill to be moved. His supporters suspect he drank poisoned tea, and accuse authorities of trying to cover up a crime. A medically equipped plane is waiting to take him to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny's team said earlier it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital and his wife, Yulia, appealed in a letter to the Kremlin to give permission for him to flown abroad. Eventually, German medics were allowed to see him and said they were ""able and willing"" to fly him to Berlin. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said it was a pity doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Reports say he could leave within hours, but Mr Navalny's spokeswoman said his departure would not happen for at least seven hours - which would be early on Saturday morning in the Siberian city. Mr Navalny remains in a coma and hospital head doctor Alexander Murakhovsky warned late on Friday they did not recommend flying,""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility."" Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the CharitÃ© hospital was ready to treat him. ""They can fly him, we are willing,"" it told the BBC. ""The circumstances and equipment make it possible."" At a news conference in Berlin, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany have been allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembles the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 When Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media purported to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Further footage showed him being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway at Omsk.

"Bruno Tonioli will not be behind the Strictly Come Dancing judges' desk for some of this year's series, while he takes part in the US version. The impassioned Italian usually appears on both Dancing With The Stars and the BBC show, flying back and forth. But that's not possible this year. He won't be replaced on the UK panel. The BBC said Tonioli would still ""be involved remotely"" in the Sunday results shows and then return full time ""towards the end of the series"". This year's series will be will be ""slightly"" shorter than usual due to the coronavirus pandemic, the broadcaster has said. It normally begins in September and ends in mid-December. Its run largely overlaps with Dancing With The Stars, which normally ends in late November. Tonioli with Carrie Ann Inaba and former Strictly judge Len Goodman on Dancing With The Stars The BBC hasn't said how long this series will be, or how long Tonioli will be away. The timing of his return is likely to depend on the transmission dates of Dancing With The Stars and any quarantine requirements. Previously, Tonioli has commuted between the shows every week. However, the current rules say anyone flying from the US to the UK and vice versa must self-isolate for two weeks. The BBC also didn't give any details of how he would take part in the results shows remotely. In a statement, Tonioli said: ""I absolutely adore being part of Strictly and can't wait to see what incredible dancing this year has in store. ""Lockdown has resulted in me being in LA for the foreseeable, but I'm excited to be involved as much as I possibly can."" Executive producer Sarah James said: ""I'm overjoyed that we've found a way for Bruno to be part of this year's Strictly. ""His passion and enthusiasm are such a big part of the show, I'm thrilled we can continue to deliver that to audiences this year."" In the past, the choreographer has usually missed one week of Strictly every series, to give him a mid-season break from travelling. In recent years, he has been replaced on the judging panel during his week off by The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro.

"The glasses had been worn by Gandhi on a trip to South Africa A pair of Mahatma Gandhi's glasses have sold for Â£260,000 after they were found sticking halfway out of an auction house's letterbox. The spectacles were bought through a phone bid from an American collector after six minutes of bidding on Friday. Auctioneer Andrew Stowe said it was a new record for East Bristol Auctions and described it as ""the star lot of the century"". The glasses had been expected to sell for about Â£15,000. Mr Stowe said the owner of the glasses was an elderly man from Mangotsfield who said he would split the money with his daughter. They had been handed down from generation to generation in the owner's family, after a relative met Gandhi on a visit to South Africa in the 1920s. The Indian civil rights leader was known for giving his possessions away, the auctioneer said ""It's a phenomenal result. These glasses represent not only an auction record for us, but a find of international historical importance,"" Mr Stowe said. The glasses had been left in a plain white envelope in a letter box at East Bristol Auctions on a Friday night and were not collected until the following Monday morning. ""They could quite easily have been stolen or fallen out or just ended up in the bin,"" Mr Stowe continued. He said the owner had no idea of their value and ""nearly had a heart attack"" when he was told they might be worth Â£15,000. ""These glasses have been lying in a drawer for the best part of fifty years. The vendor literally told me to throw them away if they were 'no good'. Now he gets a life-changing sum of money.""

"This video can not be played Highlights: Crawley & Buttler combine to put England in control Third Test, Ageas Bowl (day one of five) England 332-4 (90 overs):Crawley 171*, Buttler 87*, Yasir 2-107 Pakistan:Yet to bat Scorecard Zak Crawley's sparkling maiden Test century put England in command of the third and final Test against Pakistan on day one at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton. The 22-year-old, playing in his eighth Test, oozed elegance for his 171 not out. He shared an unbroken partnership of 205 with Jos Buttler, who continued his resurgence with the bat by making an unbeaten 87. That guided England from the difficulty of 127-4 to 332-4, a position from which they are primed to win the series. On a blustery day, Pakistan had to battle a fiercely strong wind that whistled down the ground throughout. At the end of it, they were left facing a huge battle to avoid their first series defeat by England since 2010. Watch highlights on Today at the Test Kent, India, Perth and... Cruyff - Crawley's route to 'dazzling' maiden Test century Zak Crawley's knock is his highest first-class score After the second Test on this ground was ruined by bad weather, there was a sense of foreboding when rain arrived just as the captains walked out to toss up. When the shower passed, England skipper Joe Root took the opportunity to bat on the slow, dry pitch while at the same time sending Pakistan out to field in the miserable conditions. With the sun making only fleeting appearances and the wind swirling around the empty stadium, it was Crawley who illuminated proceedings in an innings that gradually sucked the enthusiasm from the tourists. There were periods either side of lunch when the contest between bat and ball was even, not least when Root and Ollie Pope fell in the space of four overs. Buttler, though, arrived first to support, then came to life in an evening session where England rattled along at almost five an over. The second new ball was also dispatched as Pakistan gradually lost their way. By the close, England had already piled on enough to be able to take advantage of a pitch that could deteriorate, perhaps with some uneven bounce for the extra pace of Jofra Archer, restored to the side in place of Sam Curran. The Hundred can launch without crowds, says outgoing ECB chief Graves This video can not be played Watch the best of Crawley's double hundred against Pakistan Crawley was left out when England rebalanced their team because of an injury that prevented Ben Stokes from bowling. He returned with a half-century in the second Test, then produced this performance to cement his place. He announced his arrival by clipping his first ball for four, and proceeded to play all around the ground with a level of strokeplay none of his team-mates came close to matching. Dripping in class, Crawley played drives of all kinds, guides to third man, glances off the pads, took on the fast bowlers when they dropped short and swept the spinners. The Kent right-hander was able to move up and down the gears depending on the control exerted by the Pakistan bowlers, scoring 45 from his first 46 deliveries, then settling into a more even tempo. Crawley pushed Mohammad Abbas into the covers to reach three figures, celebrating with a modest raise of the bat and a kiss of the badge on his helmet. By that time Buttler has eased into the slipstream, going on to loft the leg-spin of Yasir Shah for two magnificent straight sixes. Crawley offered a half chance back to bowler Fawad Alam on 159, but remains with the opportunity for a double century, and Buttler is closing in on his second Test ton. This video can not be played England lose Burns for six to brilliant Masood catch Pakistan were on course to win the first Test before the heroics of Buttler and Chris Woakes, and the tourists had managed a competitive total in the truncated second Test. Here, they were rarely in the contest, and it would take a monumental turnaround for the tourists to preserve their strong recent record against England. Though Rory Burns edged Shaheen Afridi to fourth slip and Yasir, employed early to bowl into the wind, had an advancing Dom Sibley lbw, Pakistan had little control with the new ball. They did not manage a maiden until almost two hours into the day. They improved after lunch and were given an opening by wholehearted 17-year-old Naseem Shah. The pace bowler nipped one away to take Root's edge, with Yasir following up by scurrying through the bamboozled Pope. From there, though, they had little threat, scant discipline and decreasing energy. The Fawad drop saw shoulders slump further, and even though the new ball caused England the occasional uncomfortable moment, Pakistan were flattened by the time a rare full day of play was completed. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""The run chase at Old Trafford was dramatic, but this has been England's best day of the summer. ""It was the manner of which the partnership developed from the get-go: just playing good Test cricket. And Zak Crawley, you just can't see a better century."" Test Match Special's Aatif Nawaz:""It wasn't as much case of poor bowling from Pakistan as it was an exceptional batting performance from England. ""Jos Buttler and Zak Crawley put on a jarring display of concentration and dominance the likes of which we haven't seen too often this summer."" England batsman Zak Crawley:""It's the best feeling I've had in cricket, for sure. Hopefully I can get a few more. It's definitely one of the feelings you want again.""

"US actor John David Washington plays a character known as The Protagonist Christopher Nolan is that rare beast: an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning. Ridley Scott had the same knack, as did Stanley Kubrick: the wit to combine a vivid imagination with unabashed showmanship in order to explore complex ideas such as time and space and consciousness in the context of an epic, all-action movie. To this, Nolan adds a mastery of mixing genres. Inception was a sci-fi-heist movie, The Dark Knight a comic-book thriller. He's at it again with Tenet, which is a globe-trotting sci-fi-spy drama starring John David Washington as The Protagonist, who is given the not insignificant task of saving humanity from certain radioactive Armageddon in a looming World War III. It's a big ask, but arguably not as big a challenge as the one Nolan has been set with Tenet - which is basically to save the world of cinema from the potentially terminal twin threats of streaming giants and Covid-19. It's a combination of an unseen, mutating enemy and an insurgent fifth column, which, in terms of themes, sounds like a Nolan movie. He hasn't shirked his responsibilities. Tenet is the first major film to be screened in cinemas since the coronavirus outbreak Tenet is a big movie (shot on a mixture of Imax cameras and 70mm film) with a big budget (reported at around $200m/Â£153m), which is designed to be seen on the big screen. It is a piece of what is now called ""event"" cinema, an immersive experience to stimulate all the senses, which it does, from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's throbbing Wagnerian score to visual effects company DNEG's eye-boggling CGI. In terms of spectacle, Tenet delivers. The stunts, the camera work and the scale are impressive. As is Nolan's appetite to use blockbuster entertainment as a platform to seriously consider existential threats, the unconscious mind, and cutting-edge physics. In the past, he's given us esoteric stories of implanted dreams (Inception) and alternative universes (Interstellar), both of which felt more like fiction than science. That's not the case with Tenet, in which Nolan - who is both writer and director - grapples with the concept of time in a manner that made the incredible seem credible. Frankly, there's a lot to get your head around. The clue is in the movie's title, which not only refers to the ethical codes of conduct (tenets) expected by the ultra-secret society into which Washington's Protagonist has unwittingly been inducted, but also to its palindromic form, an allusion to the way in which Nolan is asking us to think about time. That is, it goes both ways - forwards and backwards, sometimes simultaneously. The upshot of which being, events that occur in the future can be revisited in the past, an idea illustrated in the Grandfather Paradox, which posits if a person travels back in time and kills their own grandfather before his or her parents were conceived, it would prevent the time-traveller's existence. Nolan has previously directed Inception, Memento, Interstellar, Dunkirk and The Dark Knight That's at the easier end of the temporal concepts Nolan has us grapple with, which include entropy reversal, time inversion, temporal pincer movements, and reverse cryogenology (I might have misheard that one). If that all sounds a tad complicated, you should try showing it on film. There are car chases in which The Protagonist is going forwards when all else is in reverse, fist fights that take place over millennia but happen in the same time and space, and bullets that seal rather than penetrate. Critics laud Nolan's 'mind-bending wonder' Nolan is challenging our preconceptions of time and suggesting there might be an alternative way of looking at it beyond a limited notion of linear progression. It's confusing to begin with, but by about mid-way through the film starts to make narrative sense, to such an extent that plot twists at the end are rather predictable (or, maybe that's some super clever meta-narrative device that validates the film's conceptual argument). In fact, the entire plot is rather predictable, which I suppose makes room for all the thinky physics stuff. It's a Bond-like set-up. The Protagonist is the goodie: a Western agent working for a morally sound, state-backed, above-the-board secret service. The baddie is Andrei Sator, an unscrupulous Russian businessman played with great vigour but not a lot of subtlety by Kenneth Branagh. Kenneth Branagh as Andrei Sator He is married to the glamorous Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), a British art expert working for an international auction house, who foolishly gave her husband a fake Goya: a professional and personal misjudgement that has allowed the evil Andrei to blackmail her into not leaving him. Unless, that is, she agrees never to see their little son Max (Laurie Shepherd) ever again, thereby depriving her of the joy of picking him up from his posh north London prep school. Elizabeth Debicki, recently cast as Princess Diana in The Crown, plays Kat Andrei is hell-bent on putting together the wherewithal to erase the past, present and future of the world. The Protagonist is heaven-sent to stop him. Kat is the key, a love triangle plot device that might work on paper but doesn't in the film where there is little emotional spark or screen chemistry between her and either Andrei or The Protagonist - or Max for that matter. You're left wondering why the two men are willing to stake everything that has ever been or will ever be on a bit of a cold fish with whom neither appear remotely enamoured. I'm not sure why there is such an apparent lack of connection between the main players. Maybe it's the script, or possibly that the characters are too simplified, although Washington does a good job in fleshing out The Protagonist, as does Robert Pattinson in his role as an English adventurer type, Neil. Perhaps it's the high-definition filming and extreme close-ups, which show every pore in the actors' skin, that leads to some scenes having a mannered awkwardness. Robert Pattinson, best known for Twilight, and John David Washington To that extent, it's certainly not Bond, but then, it's not not Bond either. There are action sequences with Bond-like levels of spectacle, and interior scenes in which you sense The Protagonist actively putting his tanks on 007's lawn with his own bone-dry quips (asked how he would like to die, he replies: ""Old""). What differentiates Tenet are the bigger ideas in which Nolan is framing his story. It turns what could have been a sub-Bond action-packed spy movie into an inventive, bold and thought-provoking interrogation into our perception of time. It won't leave you shaken, but your mind will be stirred. And that has to be worth a trip to the cinema. Tenet is released in the UK on Wednesday, 26 August.

"Mr DeJoy testified to Congress about delays in delivery The head of the US Postal Service has said the agency is ""fully capable and committed"" to handling the nation's mail-in votes for November's election. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told lawmakers that postal votes would continue to be prioritised and that recent policy changes were not made in attempt to influence the 2020 election. Democrats say new delivery policies could lead to issues with postal votes. The row quickly became a top campaign issue in the past two weeks. Mr DeJoy, a top Republican donor and former logistics executive appointed to lead the agency in May, told a senate panel on Friday that the delivery changes  - which have drastically slowed deliveries - were based on a ""data-driven"" review of mail volume. He addressed the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee amid a public furore to the changes, and amid concerns that they were made to help re-elect US President Donald Trump. During the hearing, Mr DeJoy fended off criticism from lawmakers who said they were concerned that the removal of mail sorting machines and post boxes would lead to millions of ballots being delivered too late to be counted on election day. Mr DeJoy told lawmakers that he is ""extremely highly confident"" that ballots sent back to state election officials seven days before election day on 3 November will still be delivered on time. It comes after the US Postal Service (USPS) sent letters to states warning that mail delays may mean that millions of ballots are unable to be returned by the deadline. ""There have been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,"" he told lawmakers, adding: ""The postal service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation's election mail fully and on time."" Slower mail delivery times in the US have raised concerns about how one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the US can handle an unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots in November's election. This year fewer people are expected to vote in-person amid the coronavirus pandemic, in which the US has seen the highest number of deaths and infections in the world. That drop-off is expected to lead to an unprecedented influx of voters submitting their ballot by mail. What is US row over postal service about? The measures, which included cuts to overtime and delivery trips as well as to equipment, were brought in as a cost saving initiative, the USPS said. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is defending the USPS ability to deliver US election mail But on Tuesday, as the backlash grew, Mr DeJoy announced that he was suspending the changes to ""avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail"". The USPS, the only government agency tasked with funding itself, faces a budget shortfall that has risen to $160bn (Â£122bn) amid a decade-long decline in mail volume which has coincided with the rise in computer-based messaging. During the hearing, Mr DeJoy denied he had spoken to Mr Trump about the changes, said that he himself has voted by mail ""for a number of years"" and called any alleged attempts to interfere in the election ""outrageous"". He also said that there are 140,000 collection boxes in the US, but over the last 10 years, about 35,000 have been removed. He added that the recent removal of mail sorting equipment and boxes predates his tenure. ""I repeat, both the collection boxes and this machine closedown I was â I was made aware when everybody else was made aware,"" Mr DeJoy said. During the hearing, which was conducted over video-link, one Democratic senator told Mr DeJoy that he owed the American public an ""apology for the harm you have caused"". Michigan Senator Gary Peters said medications have arrived weeks late forcing people to skip doses, and businesses that relay on mail have been forced to layoff customers ""all because of changes you directed"". Delaware Democrat Tom Carper suffered an apparent hot mic moment, when lawmakers heard him uttering profanity to an aide as he tried to connect his video feed. A spokesman for Mr Carper said the senator ""got frustrated with technical difficulties this morning, but that pales in comparison to his frustration with a Postmaster General who's actively undermining the US Postal Service during a national crisis"". Democrats in the House of Representatives plan to hold a rare Saturday session to pass $25bn (Â£19bn) in spending to help mail in voting operations. Twenty states have sued the USPS to reverse the changes that have already been made. The mail slowdown has been felt across the US. In California and Maine, farmers who raise chickens have reported receiving orders of dead baby chicks. The chicks are sent live through the mail, and typically only a few die in transit, farmers say. California mail sorting centres have suffered insect outbreaks as food rots inside packages, according to the LA Times.

"A series of massive fires in northern and central California forced more evacuations California is struggling to contain huge wildfires burning forests and homes, warned Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday as more than 12,000 fire-fighters battled blazes that have killed six people. Help was on its way from several US states as Gov Newsom put in a plea for assistance from Australia and Canada. ""These fires are stretching our resources, our personnel,"" he said. Among the 560 fires are some of the largest the state has seen. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reachedwhat could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded. By Friday, emergency officials said some of the fires had doubled in size in a day, forcing 175,000 residents to flee. Two fires are now the 7th and 10th largest in the state's history, Gov Newsom said as he urged President Donald Trump to sign a major disaster declaration. The CZU Lightning Complex fire destroyed homes in Davenport, California The worst are in the mountains to the south and east of San Francisco. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. Many blazes are burning on steep, difficult-to-access terrain and have been fuelled by strong winds. The fires are also threatening larger towns including Santa Cruz where flames reached within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus, reports Reuters news agency. More fire=fighters, engines and surveillance planes are racing in from other states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas to help. Assistance from what Gov Newsom called ""the world's best wildfire-fighters"" in Australia has been requested. ""We simply haven't seen anything like this in many, many years,"" he said, adding that an area the size of the US state of Rhode Island had already burned within California. Redwoods, the tallest trees in the world, have caught fire near their eponymous state park With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. One woman told CNN she had been forced to flee to a community centre in Vacaville but was refusing to go inside for fear of catching coronavirus. ""Not only are we dealing with Covid, but with also the heat and now the fires,"" said Cheryl Jarvis, who said she was currently sleeping in her Toyota Prius. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Wash your hands often Keep six feet of distance from anyone not among your household Wear a face covering when possible, and if possible, wash it regularly Avoid sharing food and drinks Frequently disinfect your area in the shelter (including toys and electronics) Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature. Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. In another pandemic twist, officials also advise that people remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing an electricity strain, which has caused a rolling blackout for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts. In total, more than 1,205 square miles (3,121 sq km) have burned across the state. A mother and daughter in an evacuation centre in Vacaville Satellite images show smoke blanketing nearly all of California, as well most of Nevada and southern Idaho. Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park and home to redwood trees that are 2,000 years old, sustained extensive damage to historic buildings. Firefighting teams are stretched thin across the state and have been forced to work longer shifts than usual. A volunteer firefighting corps made up of state prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, has been diminished this year due to the pandemic. Fires have burned through parts of California's wine-producing regions President Trump blamed California for the fires, and threatened to withhold federal funding ashe repeated a suggestion that was met with bemusement when he first raised it in 2018. Speaking to supporters in Pennsylvania on Thursday, he said he had told state officials: ""You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests â there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up."" ""I've been telling them this now for three years, but they don't want to listen,"" he said. ""'The environment, the environment,' but they have massive fires again.""

"STA Travel has become the latest travel firm to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, which grew out of a student travel business and specialised in trips for young people, including gap years and volunteer projects, has ceased trading. STA Travel has more than 50 shops in the UK. The firm said customers with bookings would ""receive further communication in the coming days"". ""We are sorry for the inconvenience and the limited information available to you at this time,"" a statement onits website said.,external About 500 UK jobs are thought to be at risk as a result of the firm's failure. The firm's parent company, based in Switzerland, said the pandemic had ""brought the travel industry to a standstill"". Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? What are the UK's travel rules? Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said the news would ""send a shockwave through the industry, bringing to life the very real pressures that travel is under at the moment"". ""STA Travel will be a name that is familiar to most people who will have used them to travel or been aware of their name on the High Street, and this distressing news will sadly affect the livelihoods of hundreds of employees,"" the spokesperson said. ABTA says the majority of flights and holidays sold by STA would be protected by the Atol scheme, an insurance scheme which protects holiday bookings. It directed customers toits website,externalfor further advice. Amelia should have taken her month-long holiday to Bali and Borneo back in April but, when the pandemic arrived, it was postponed until September. STA Travel told her and her boyfriend last week their trip would no longer go ahead at all. Now the 22-year-old from Walsall just wants to get her money back as quickly as possible. ""The STA agent said they would offer us credit notes but they would be split up between the different companies that STA booked all our travel and accommodation through. ""There is no way we would be able to spend all of the credit notes on the same trip if we did it ourselves. ""It's really, really disappointing - we just hope we can get our money back quickly but I'm not sure we will."" The Civil Aviation Authority said it was aware of ""a number of consumers whose bookings have been cancelled by STA Travel Ltd as a result of government advice or flight cancellations"". Customers whose bookings were protected by Atol would be able to submit a claim through their online portal, the CAA said. STA Travel, which originally stood for Student Travel Australia, but was later rebranded Student Travel Association, was founded in 1971, and specialises in long-haul, adventure and gap year travel. The firm said: ""Over recent months, the company took decisive measures to secure the business beyond Covid-19. ""However, sales have not picked up as anticipated, due to consumer uncertainties, further restrictions and renewed lock-down measures, which are expected to largely continue into 2021."" Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, said coronavirus had particularly hit long-haul specialists like STA, which arranged tailor-made trips. He said a combination of High Street rents, a lack of income and demands for refunds was made worse when Australian airline Qantas announced it would not be running intercontinental flights in or out of Australia until the second half of 2021. ""Clearly the parent companyâ¦ had to look at the future and just decided that there was no chance of business coming back at anything like the necessary amount before next year,"" Mr Calder said. He added that ""other casualties"" were inevitable - particularly with countries being suddenly added to the UK's quarantine list. ""That's generated so much uncertainty that people simply aren't flying,"" he said. Have you got a trip booked with STA Travel?

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more

It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more

"Mr DeJoy testified to Congress about delays in delivery The head of the US Postal Service has said the agency is ""fully capable and committed"" to handling the nation's mail-in votes for November's election. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told lawmakers that postal votes would continue to be prioritised and that recent policy changes were not made in attempt to influence the 2020 election. Democrats say new delivery policies could lead to issues with postal votes. The row quickly became a top campaign issue in the past two weeks. Mr DeJoy, a top Republican donor and former logistics executive appointed to lead the agency in May, told a senate panel on Friday that the delivery changes  - which have drastically slowed deliveries - were based on a ""data-driven"" review of mail volume. He addressed the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee amid a public furore to the changes, and amid concerns that they were made to help re-elect US President Donald Trump. During the hearing, Mr DeJoy fended off criticism from lawmakers who said they were concerned that the removal of mail sorting machines and post boxes would lead to millions of ballots being delivered too late to be counted on election day. Mr DeJoy told lawmakers that he is ""extremely highly confident"" that ballots sent back to state election officials seven days before election day on 3 November will still be delivered on time. It comes after the US Postal Service (USPS) sent letters to states warning that mail delays may mean that millions of ballots are unable to be returned by the deadline. ""There have been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,"" he told lawmakers, adding: ""The postal service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation's election mail fully and on time."" Slower mail delivery times in the US have raised concerns about how one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the US can handle an unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots in November's election. This year fewer people are expected to vote in-person amid the coronavirus pandemic, in which the US has seen the highest number of deaths and infections in the world. That drop-off is expected to lead to an unprecedented influx of voters submitting their ballot by mail. What is US row over postal service about? The measures, which included cuts to overtime and delivery trips as well as to equipment, were brought in as a cost saving initiative, the USPS said. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is defending the USPS ability to deliver US election mail But on Tuesday, as the backlash grew, Mr DeJoy announced that he was suspending the changes to ""avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail"". The USPS, the only government agency tasked with funding itself, faces a budget shortfall that has risen to $160bn (Â£122bn) amid a decade-long decline in mail volume which has coincided with the rise in computer-based messaging. During the hearing, Mr DeJoy denied he had spoken to Mr Trump about the changes, said that he himself has voted by mail ""for a number of years"" and called any alleged attempts to interfere in the election ""outrageous"". He also said that there are 140,000 collection boxes in the US, but over the last 10 years, about 35,000 have been removed. He added that the recent removal of mail sorting equipment and boxes predates his tenure. ""I repeat, both the collection boxes and this machine closedown I was â I was made aware when everybody else was made aware,"" Mr DeJoy said. During the hearing, which was conducted over video-link, one Democratic senator told Mr DeJoy that he owed the American public an ""apology for the harm you have caused"". Michigan Senator Gary Peters said medications have arrived weeks late forcing people to skip doses, and businesses that relay on mail have been forced to layoff customers ""all because of changes you directed"". Delaware Democrat Tom Carper suffered an apparent hot mic moment, when lawmakers heard him uttering profanity to an aide as he tried to connect his video feed. A spokesman for Mr Carper said the senator ""got frustrated with technical difficulties this morning, but that pales in comparison to his frustration with a Postmaster General who's actively undermining the US Postal Service during a national crisis"". Democrats in the House of Representatives plan to hold a rare Saturday session to pass $25bn (Â£19bn) in spending to help mail in voting operations. Twenty states have sued the USPS to reverse the changes that have already been made. The mail slowdown has been felt across the US. In California and Maine, farmers who raise chickens have reported receiving orders of dead baby chicks. The chicks are sent live through the mail, and typically only a few die in transit, farmers say. California mail sorting centres have suffered insect outbreaks as food rots inside packages, according to the LA Times.

here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said.

"PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks before he was killed The killers of PC Andrew Harper have had their sentences referred to the Court of Appeal after the attorney general considered them to be ""unduly lenient"". Suella Braverman QC said attacks against emergency workers should be ""punished with the greatest severity"". PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car in Berkshire last August. Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were convicted of manslaughter. The driver, Long, 19, wasjailed for 16 years while his passengers Bowers and Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. All three were cleared of murder charges following a trial at the Old Bailey in London. At the time of the offence, Bowers and Cole were both 17. Only Long, aged 18, was an adult. During sentencing Mr Justice Edis said the age of the defendants at the time of the offence was a mitigating factor in determining the length of their jail terms. Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) The Attorney General Suella Braverman said PC Harper's killing was a ""horrific crime which resulted in the death of a much-respected police officer while he was on-duty, protecting his community"". She said she had referred the sentences after ""having personally considered the details of this shocking case"". ""Offenders should be punished with the greatest severity for such heinous crimes,"" she added. The unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme allows people to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are too low. It only requires one complaint for the attorney general's office to consider whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. The killing that sparked an outpouring of love 'No real justice' for PC Harper, widow says People often complain about sentences in criminal cases - but relatively few of the tens of thousands imposed every year are lengthened or made tougher. Last year, the Attorney General's Office considered 577 cases which met the criteria for review. Just 93 were referred to the Court of Appeal, 63 of which resulted in offenders receiving longer jail terms or being sent to prison where they had originally avoided it. It's a high bar: the attorney will only send cases for appeal where a judge is believed to have made a ""gross error"" or handed down a sentence ""outside the range"" of those available. A sentence that is a bit short, soft or low won't be changed by the Court - it must be ""unduly lenient"", in other words, very low. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their crimes"", Mrs Harper said The referral comes after PC Harper's widow Lissie and his mother Deborah Adlam launched campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Lissie Harper said the attorney general's decision was ""great news"" and thanked the public for their ""continued and unstinting support"" for her campaign. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their heinous crime,"" she said. ""It was not justice and it needs to be addressed. Police officers need to be properly protected by the judicial system."" Also reacting to the decision, Mrs Adlam said: ""My family and I know that the whole nation stands with us in outrage at the sentences handed down to my son's killers. ""We can only hope that a fairer outcome is reached by the Court of Appeal."" The maximum sentence a judge can impose for manslaughter is life imprisonment but they must specify a minimum term to be served. The scheme allows victims of crime, their families, prosecutors and the public to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are unfair. The attorney general can only ask the Court of Appeal to review a sentence under the ULS scheme if they consider that sentence to be ""unduly lenient"". It means, for example, that a sentencing judge made a gross error or imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences available. The scheme only applies to sentences given in crown courts in England and Wales. The attorney general acts independently of government when deciding on unduly lenient sentences. Source: Attorney general's office. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died Mr Justice Edis, the sentencing judge in the case, told the Old Bailey each of the jail terms for PC Harper's killers had to reflect ""the seriousness of this case"". Sentencing Long, he told the leader of the group ""although this is an extremely serious offence""  he had decided not impose a life sentence because of his age. ""A man only a few years older than you would have received a life sentence,"" the judge said. Long's custodial term had a starting point of 24 years, but was reduced to 16 years due to his age and his guilty plea of manslaughter. He will serve 10 years and eight months before he is considered for parole. The judge said a starting point of 20 years for Cole and Bowers was reduced  to 13 years each due to their ages and ""immaturity"". A date for the hearing at the Court of Appeal has yet to be set. On Wednesday, Bowers and Colelodged applications with the Court of Appeal seeking permission to challenge their manslaughter convictions and sentences.

"PSG fans gathered in Paris to celebrate their Champions League semi-final win A ban on Paris Saint-Germain fans wearing their team's shirt in the city centre of fierce rivals Marseille on Sunday has been rescinded. Police had announced the ban for when the Parisians take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. Clothing even ""displaying the colours of PSG"" was off-limits. But the order was later rolled back after the decision was met with widespread criticism. Justifying its initial ban, the police said ""there is strong animosity on the part of some Marseille residents, supporters or not, toward the PSG team, in contradiction with any sporting spirit"". The order came due to disturbances in Marseille during PSG'ssemi-final win over German side Leipzig. One man was arrested for attacking a man wearing a PSG shirt. Hundreds of Marseille fans sang anti-PSG songs and detonated firecrackers. But Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne police later backtracked on the order. ""The sole purpose of this decree was to protect Parisian supporters, and in no way intended to restrict freedom of movement,"" it said on Twitter. It added that it had decided to repeal the total ban on PSG fans due to the ""incomprehension caused by this decree"". The PSG-Bayern game takes place at Benfica's stadium in Lisbon.

"Robyn Goldie was neglected during the last year of her life with mother Sharon A mother who left her dying daughter at home while she went to a pub has pleaded guilty to neglect. Sharon Goldie, 45, claimed her child, Robyn, was ""attention seeking"" despite the 13-year-old begging for help. When she returned home in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, Robyn was slumped on the sofa, having died from the effects of a perforated stomach ulcer. The court heard the child had endured a year of neglect, including having to ask someone for Â£1 to buy food. The High Court in Glasgow was told Robyn had lived with Goldie until she was four before moving in with her grandmother where she enjoyed a ""stable life"". But she had returned to live with her mother in 2017, a year before her death. Social workers, who were monitoring the pair, said there was often friction between them, and Robyn was unhappy with her mother's drinking. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said Goldie appeared to be a regular at the Melody Bar in Wishaw. Miss Edwards said: ""Robyn was often seen attending there looking for Goldie and asking for money to buy food. ""She also often approached a neighbour asking for Â£1 to get food."" Robyn once said she had only had a yoghurt that day. The child was described as ""thin, dirty and unkempt"". The child told friends how when drunk, Goldie would offer her cannabis and alcohol while ""constantly"" insisting she did not want her in the house. On one occasion Robyn called a gas company, complaining she was cold at the house, which smelled badly of cat urine, the court heard. A few months before her death Robyn was found to have a rash caused by fleas. The week before she died Robyn had complained of a sore stomach and legs, and was given painkillers. On 21 July, Goldie told staff at the Melody Bar she had ""locked"" her daughter in the house ""so she could not get out"". The next day, Robyn complained to a friend she had been ill and not eaten for days. On 24 July, Robyn texted her grandmother claiming she felt ""a lot better"" but a friend of Goldie saw the ""drained"" child that day and told her: ""She's just not well"". That night, Robyn told Goldie to get help as she had ""pain all over"" but the mother refused to contact the ambulance service. A friend of Goldie offered to take the girl to hospital in a taxi, but she stopped him, claiming the girl was ""attention seeking"". The next day, Robyn begged a neighbour to get her an ambulance as she could not breathe, but the mother yelled at her to ""get in"". Sharon Goldie appeared at the High Court at Glasgow On 26 July - the day Robyn died - a social worker turned up in the morning to take Robyn to a catering class. Ms Edwards explained: ""Goldie spoke...through the letterbox explaining that Robyn was not well and had been unwell since the previous Thursday."" Despite her daughter being ill, Goldie then went to the pub, returning home later with a friend to find Robyn slumped on the sofa and unresponsive. Ms Edwards said: ""Goldie and the man got another drink from the fridge and went outside 'because the weather was nice'."" The friend later checked on Robyn again and discovered she was dead. When an ambulance was called, Goldie told paramedics: ""She's at it."" On being told the child had died, she wailed and said: ""No, she cannot be."" Goldie later told police she thought Robyn had a bug, but was getting better and she thought her daughter was ""trying to wind her up"". Miss Edwards: ""She said she had told Robyn that ambulances are for people with heart attacks."" Robyn was found to have died from peritonitis as a result of a perforated ulcer. A senior medic concluded that had the teenager been treated during her illness, she would have been ""expected to survive"". Goldie pled guilty to a charge under the Children and Young Persons Act of wilfully ill-treating and neglecting Robyn. Prosecutors accepted her not guilty plea to the charge of culpable homicide. The court heard Goldie had suffered a brain injury following a car accident when she was a child. In 2003, she was an in-patient for mental health issues, but stopped taking her medication. The judge Lord Beckett said it was a serious case, but asked for more information before passing sentence.

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long.""

here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks before he was killed The killers of PC Andrew Harper have had their sentences referred to the Court of Appeal after the attorney general considered them to be ""unduly lenient"". Suella Braverman QC said attacks against emergency workers should be ""punished with the greatest severity"". PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car in Berkshire last August. Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were convicted of manslaughter. The driver, Long, 19, wasjailed for 16 years while his passengers Bowers and Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. All three were cleared of murder charges following a trial at the Old Bailey in London. At the time of the offence, Bowers and Cole were both 17. Only Long, aged 18, was an adult. During sentencing Mr Justice Edis said the age of the defendants at the time of the offence was a mitigating factor in determining the length of their jail terms. Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) The Attorney General Suella Braverman said PC Harper's killing was a ""horrific crime which resulted in the death of a much-respected police officer while he was on-duty, protecting his community"". She said she had referred the sentences after ""having personally considered the details of this shocking case"". ""Offenders should be punished with the greatest severity for such heinous crimes,"" she added. The unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme allows people to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are too low. It only requires one complaint for the attorney general's office to consider whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. The killing that sparked an outpouring of love 'No real justice' for PC Harper, widow says People often complain about sentences in criminal cases - but relatively few of the tens of thousands imposed every year are lengthened or made tougher. Last year, the Attorney General's Office considered 577 cases which met the criteria for review. Just 93 were referred to the Court of Appeal, 63 of which resulted in offenders receiving longer jail terms or being sent to prison where they had originally avoided it. It's a high bar: the attorney will only send cases for appeal where a judge is believed to have made a ""gross error"" or handed down a sentence ""outside the range"" of those available. A sentence that is a bit short, soft or low won't be changed by the Court - it must be ""unduly lenient"", in other words, very low. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their crimes"", Mrs Harper said The referral comes after PC Harper's widow Lissie and his mother Deborah Adlam launched campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Lissie Harper said the attorney general's decision was ""great news"" and thanked the public for their ""continued and unstinting support"" for her campaign. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their heinous crime,"" she said. ""It was not justice and it needs to be addressed. Police officers need to be properly protected by the judicial system."" Also reacting to the decision, Mrs Adlam said: ""My family and I know that the whole nation stands with us in outrage at the sentences handed down to my son's killers. ""We can only hope that a fairer outcome is reached by the Court of Appeal."" The maximum sentence a judge can impose for manslaughter is life imprisonment but they must specify a minimum term to be served. The scheme allows victims of crime, their families, prosecutors and the public to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are unfair. The attorney general can only ask the Court of Appeal to review a sentence under the ULS scheme if they consider that sentence to be ""unduly lenient"". It means, for example, that a sentencing judge made a gross error or imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences available. The scheme only applies to sentences given in crown courts in England and Wales. The attorney general acts independently of government when deciding on unduly lenient sentences. Source: Attorney general's office. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died Mr Justice Edis, the sentencing judge in the case, told the Old Bailey each of the jail terms for PC Harper's killers had to reflect ""the seriousness of this case"". Sentencing Long, he told the leader of the group ""although this is an extremely serious offence""  he had decided not impose a life sentence because of his age. ""A man only a few years older than you would have received a life sentence,"" the judge said. Long's custodial term had a starting point of 24 years, but was reduced to 16 years due to his age and his guilty plea of manslaughter. He will serve 10 years and eight months before he is considered for parole. The judge said a starting point of 20 years for Cole and Bowers was reduced  to 13 years each due to their ages and ""immaturity"". A date for the hearing at the Court of Appeal has yet to be set. On Wednesday, Bowers and Colelodged applications with the Court of Appeal seeking permission to challenge their manslaughter convictions and sentences.

"This video can not be played Landslip train had reached almost 73mph The train which derailed in Aberdeenshire, leaving three men dead, had reached almost 73mph before it hit a landslip, a report has said. Driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died near Stonehaven. Six others were injured. The train derailed following heavy rain last week. An initialreport by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch,externalsaid the train was travelling within the speed limit. The RAIB said it reached 72.8 mph (117.1 km/h) and this was ""within the maximum permitted of 75 mph (120 km/h) on this stretch of line"". Minute's silence honours train crash victims Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment The report confirms that the accident took place at about 09:38, just a few minutes before the first reports reached the emergency services. Investigators said all six vehicles of the train derailed after it struck the landslip 1.4 miles north-east of Carmont in Aberdeenshire. Nine people were on board, a crew of three and six passengers. Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury died after the train left the tracks Describing conditions at the time of the crash, the RAIB said there had been thunderstorms in the area, with 52mm (2in) of rain falling within the space of four hours. This is about 70% of the total monthly rainfall which could be expected in Aberdeenshire in August. The high speed train - with two power cars and four carriages - had been operating the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow. It was initially stopped at Carmont at 06:59, after a northbound train reported a landslip further south, on the section of track between Carmont and Laurencekirk. After sitting at Carmont for more than two hours, it was decided to move the train back to Stonehaven, to allow passengers to get off. The driver was given permission to move north at 09:25, moving at 5mph initially as it crossed on to the northbound track, but then accelerating to 72.8mph. The investigators said that, after it was derailed by the landslip, the train continued for 77 yards (70 metres) before hitting the parapet of a bridge. The train came off the tracks as it attempted to return to Stonehaven The report states: ""The leading power car continued most of the way over the bridge and fell from the railway down a wooded embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, having rotated to be almost at right angles to the track. ""The second passenger carriage also overturned on to its roof and came to rest on the first carriage. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and attached to the rear power car; it also came to rest on the first carriage. All wheelsets of the rear power car derailed, but it remained upright."" The RAIB says its detailed investigation will include: The sequence of events and the actions of those involved The operating procedures applied The management of earthworks and drainage in this area, including recent inspections and risk assessments The general management of earthworks and drainage and associated procedures designed to manage the risk of extreme weather events The behaviour of the train during, and following the derailment The consequences of the derailment and a review of the damage caused to the rolling stock The investigation carried out by the RAIB is independent of parallel work being carried out by the rail industry, and of the investigation being undertaken by the police under the instruction of the Lord Advocate. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: ""My thoughts remain with the families and friends of Brett, Donald and Christopher, and everybody else affected by the tragic events of last week. Our railway family is still in shock. ""We are doing everything we can to support ongoing investigations so that we can properly establish the circumstances that led to the derailment, and to understand what can be done to prevent such a tragedy again."" A one-minute silence was held at railway stations on Wednesday across the UK to honour the three men killed. Family members of the men who lost their lives were among those who gathered at Aberdeen station. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Minute's silence honours train crash victims Derailment relatives gather for one minute silence.

"This video can not be played The chances of an EU-UK postâBrexit trade deal âseems unlikelyâ says the EUâs chief negotiator. A post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU ""seems unlikely"" at this stage, the bloc's negotiator has said. Speaking after the latest round of talks, Michel Barnier said he was ""disappointed"" and ""concerned"". His UK counterpart David Frost spoke of ""little progress"", amid differences on fisheries policy and state aid rules. The EU has said it would like to agree a deal by October so it can be approved by the European Parliament before the post-Brexit transition period expires. The transition periodends on 31 December and, if a deal has not been secured by then, the UK would have to trade with the EU on WTO (World Trade Organization) terms. This means most UK goods would be subject to tariffs until a free trade deal was ready to be brought in. The UK has said it will not extend talks if an agreement cannot be reached by the December deadline. UK-EU trade deal some way off, both sides say What are the sticking points in the trade talks? The EU and UK are locked in last-minute power play In a statement released after the seventh round of talks, Mr Frost said the EU had made it ""unnecessarily difficult"" to make progress by insisting that differences over state aid and fisheries have to be resolved before ""substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts"". In a bid to break the deadlock, the UK has presented the EU with a draft legal text for a free-trade agreement. Mr Frost, who reports directly to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said the UK was seeking a deal which ""ensures we regain sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters"". By Nick Beake, Brussels correspondent We were never expecting a big breakthrough this week. But the frustration and exasperation expressed publicly on both sides underlines how tough reaching a meaningful deal will be over the next six weeks. For the UK, it's a frustration that the EU is not willing to commit to paper areas of agreement until the big stumbling blocks - fishing and state aid - are overcome. For the EU, it's a frustration that the British continue to want the benefits of the single market - for UK hauliers, for example - without paying the membership fee or signing up to its rules. Amid the talk of disappointment, time-wasting and a lack of compromise, both sides insist they do want a deal. I'm told the latest round of discussions were courteous and friendly, with a warmth between the two chief negotiators facing each other - even if each is delivering an uncomfortable message. They've been sitting in the other's gaze, but hardly seeing eye-to-eye. ""When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress,"" he said. A senior UK negotiating official added that a deal was ""still possible but not that easy to get there"". They also said it was ""frustrating"" that the EU ""says Brexit means Brexit... yet they want us to continue with arrangements as though we were still [an EU] member"". ""Frustrating that they want us to move towards their position on fishing and state aid before doing anything else."" Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Barnier accused the UK side of ""wasting valuable time"", suggesting the draft text was ""useful"" but downplaying its significance in reaching any agreement. ""Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,"" he said. Fishing rights is one of the areas where significant differences remain ""Given the short time left, what I said in London in July remains true, today at this stage, an agreement between the UK and EU seems unlikely."" While there had been progress on energy co-operation, participation in union programmes and anti-money laundering, on the subject of access to UK and EU fishing waters, there had been ""no progress whatsoever"". He also said the EU's demand for a level-playing field - one of the other sticking points in negotiations - was ""a non-negotiable pre-condition to grant access to our market of 450 million citizens"". Brexit: What is a level playing field? Who really owns UK fishing rights? A level-playing field is a trade policy term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals and gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. The EU has been insistent there should be level-playing field for workers' rights, environmental protection, taxation and state aid. The next round of talks is due to begin on 7 September in London.

"US actor John David Washington plays a character known as The Protagonist Christopher Nolan is that rare beast: an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning. Ridley Scott had the same knack, as did Stanley Kubrick: the wit to combine a vivid imagination with unabashed showmanship in order to explore complex ideas such as time and space and consciousness in the context of an epic, all-action movie. To this, Nolan adds a mastery of mixing genres. Inception was a sci-fi-heist movie, The Dark Knight a comic-book thriller. He's at it again with Tenet, which is a globe-trotting sci-fi-spy drama starring John David Washington as The Protagonist, who is given the not insignificant task of saving humanity from certain radioactive Armageddon in a looming World War III. It's a big ask, but arguably not as big a challenge as the one Nolan has been set with Tenet - which is basically to save the world of cinema from the potentially terminal twin threats of streaming giants and Covid-19. It's a combination of an unseen, mutating enemy and an insurgent fifth column, which, in terms of themes, sounds like a Nolan movie. He hasn't shirked his responsibilities. Tenet is the first major film to be screened in cinemas since the coronavirus outbreak Tenet is a big movie (shot on a mixture of Imax cameras and 70mm film) with a big budget (reported at around $200m/Â£153m), which is designed to be seen on the big screen. It is a piece of what is now called ""event"" cinema, an immersive experience to stimulate all the senses, which it does, from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's throbbing Wagnerian score to visual effects company DNEG's eye-boggling CGI. In terms of spectacle, Tenet delivers. The stunts, the camera work and the scale are impressive. As is Nolan's appetite to use blockbuster entertainment as a platform to seriously consider existential threats, the unconscious mind, and cutting-edge physics. In the past, he's given us esoteric stories of implanted dreams (Inception) and alternative universes (Interstellar), both of which felt more like fiction than science. That's not the case with Tenet, in which Nolan - who is both writer and director - grapples with the concept of time in a manner that made the incredible seem credible. Frankly, there's a lot to get your head around. The clue is in the movie's title, which not only refers to the ethical codes of conduct (tenets) expected by the ultra-secret society into which Washington's Protagonist has unwittingly been inducted, but also to its palindromic form, an allusion to the way in which Nolan is asking us to think about time. That is, it goes both ways - forwards and backwards, sometimes simultaneously. The upshot of which being, events that occur in the future can be revisited in the past, an idea illustrated in the Grandfather Paradox, which posits if a person travels back in time and kills their own grandfather before his or her parents were conceived, it would prevent the time-traveller's existence. Nolan has previously directed Inception, Memento, Interstellar, Dunkirk and The Dark Knight That's at the easier end of the temporal concepts Nolan has us grapple with, which include entropy reversal, time inversion, temporal pincer movements, and reverse cryogenology (I might have misheard that one). If that all sounds a tad complicated, you should try showing it on film. There are car chases in which The Protagonist is going forwards when all else is in reverse, fist fights that take place over millennia but happen in the same time and space, and bullets that seal rather than penetrate. Critics laud Nolan's 'mind-bending wonder' Nolan is challenging our preconceptions of time and suggesting there might be an alternative way of looking at it beyond a limited notion of linear progression. It's confusing to begin with, but by about mid-way through the film starts to make narrative sense, to such an extent that plot twists at the end are rather predictable (or, maybe that's some super clever meta-narrative device that validates the film's conceptual argument). In fact, the entire plot is rather predictable, which I suppose makes room for all the thinky physics stuff. It's a Bond-like set-up. The Protagonist is the goodie: a Western agent working for a morally sound, state-backed, above-the-board secret service. The baddie is Andrei Sator, an unscrupulous Russian businessman played with great vigour but not a lot of subtlety by Kenneth Branagh. Kenneth Branagh as Andrei Sator He is married to the glamorous Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), a British art expert working for an international auction house, who foolishly gave her husband a fake Goya: a professional and personal misjudgement that has allowed the evil Andrei to blackmail her into not leaving him. Unless, that is, she agrees never to see their little son Max (Laurie Shepherd) ever again, thereby depriving her of the joy of picking him up from his posh north London prep school. Elizabeth Debicki, recently cast as Princess Diana in The Crown, plays Kat Andrei is hell-bent on putting together the wherewithal to erase the past, present and future of the world. The Protagonist is heaven-sent to stop him. Kat is the key, a love triangle plot device that might work on paper but doesn't in the film where there is little emotional spark or screen chemistry between her and either Andrei or The Protagonist - or Max for that matter. You're left wondering why the two men are willing to stake everything that has ever been or will ever be on a bit of a cold fish with whom neither appear remotely enamoured. I'm not sure why there is such an apparent lack of connection between the main players. Maybe it's the script, or possibly that the characters are too simplified, although Washington does a good job in fleshing out The Protagonist, as does Robert Pattinson in his role as an English adventurer type, Neil. Perhaps it's the high-definition filming and extreme close-ups, which show every pore in the actors' skin, that leads to some scenes having a mannered awkwardness. Robert Pattinson, best known for Twilight, and John David Washington To that extent, it's certainly not Bond, but then, it's not not Bond either. There are action sequences with Bond-like levels of spectacle, and interior scenes in which you sense The Protagonist actively putting his tanks on 007's lawn with his own bone-dry quips (asked how he would like to die, he replies: ""Old""). What differentiates Tenet are the bigger ideas in which Nolan is framing his story. It turns what could have been a sub-Bond action-packed spy movie into an inventive, bold and thought-provoking interrogation into our perception of time. It won't leave you shaken, but your mind will be stirred. And that has to be worth a trip to the cinema. Tenet is released in the UK on Wednesday, 26 August.

"Jeremy Clarkson has hosted the quiz show since 2018 The next series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? will see a UK contestant win the jackpot for the first time in 14 years. The currently unnamed contestant answered all 15 questions correctly to become the show's sixth champion. Host Jeremy Clarkson said he was ""in awe"" and believed them to be the best entrant in the programme's history. This series wasfilmed without a studio audience, meaning the Ask The Audience lifeline has disappeared. Instead, contestants have been able to use the Phone A Friend option twice. The new series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire will begin on ITV next month. Clarkson said: ""Well, I'm absolutely thrilled and delighted that we've found someone who seems to know just about everything. ""I can't wait for the viewers to see it and I want to watch it back too."" He continued: ""I was just in awe of this contestant and think they are probably the best the show has ever had in its 22-year history. ""It was a joy to sit and watch it unfold."" Clarkson, who alsohosts The Grand Tour, said the contestant ""whizzed through the 15 questions and all of a sudden confetti was falling from the ceiling and I was saying, 'You've just won Â£1m'. ""I wasn't sure I'd ever get to utter those immortal six words and I'm not embarrassed to say, it was a little emotional but boy did it feel good."" The show's coughing scandal was the subject of ITV's recent drama Quiz But some were puzzled by the decision to announce the winner before the episode's broadcast, suggesting knowing in advance was a spoiler. ""I don't understand why ITV have told everyone that this has happened?""said TV critic Scott Bryan.,external One fan replied: ""Speaking as a regular viewer, this kind of ruins it for me. Part of the fun is the anticipation, and when you know it's going to happen, it's ruined."" But the Daily Mirror's showbiz editor Mark Jeffriestweeted:,external""My guess is 1) I think they thought it might leak 2) They are hoping it boosts ratings and people tune in every night for the whole run to make sure they see the winner."" In May, retired doctor Andrew Townsley, from Glasgow, came close to the jackpot but walked away with Â£500,000. Ingram Wilcox was the most recent winner of the top prize, taking home Â£1m in 2006. In all, five contestants have previously won the Â£1m prize on the UK version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? That does not include Major Charles Ingram, who appeared to hit the jackpot but was lateraccused of cheating in the infamous coughing scandal.His story was recently depicted in the ITV drama Quiz. The show's first millionaire was Judith Keppel in November 2000. The other champions were David Edwards (2001), Robert Brydges (2001), Pat Gibson (2004) and Wilcox (2006).

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors treating Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who fell into a coma after being taken ill on a plane, have changed their minds and agreed to let him be flown to Germany. The doctors, in the Siberian city of Omsk, had earlier insisted he was too ill to be moved. His supporters suspect he drank poisoned tea, and accuse authorities of trying to cover up a crime. A medically equipped plane is waiting to take him to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny's team said earlier it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital and his wife, Yulia, appealed in a letter to the Kremlin to give permission for him to flown abroad. Eventually, German medics were allowed to see him and said they were ""able and willing"" to fly him to Berlin. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said it was a pity doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Reports say he could leave within hours, but Mr Navalny's spokeswoman said his departure would not happen for at least seven hours - which would be early on Saturday morning in the Siberian city. Mr Navalny remains in a coma and hospital head doctor Alexander Murakhovsky warned late on Friday they did not recommend flying,""but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic"". ""The patient's condition is stable,"" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility."" Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency thatthe chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity,external, but its concentration was impossible to establish. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidateJoe Biden has described the incident as ""unacceptable"",externaland vowed that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the CharitÃ© hospital was ready to treat him. ""They can fly him, we are willing,"" it told the BBC. ""The circumstances and equipment make it possible."" At a news conference in Berlin, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but abruptly stopped doing so. Medical experts from Germany have been allowed to see Mr Navalny ""[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,"" he said. ""The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves."" The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembles the ""poisoning"" of her ex-husband. ""What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,"" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: ""I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 When Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media purported to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Further footage showed him being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway at Omsk.

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors say leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny - who supporters believe was poisoned - remains too ill to be moved to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny has been in a coma since Thursday when he fell ill on a flight. His supporters called the doctors' decision ""a direct threat to his life"". The doctors say no poison was found in his body. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. German doctors have now been given access to him in hospital, one of his aides told reporters. At a news conference in Berlin, Leonid Volkov said a medically equipped plane sent from Germany was still waiting for him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he is in hospital. In a preliminary diagnosis on Friday, doctors said his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. The head doctor at the hospital treating Mr Navalny in Omsk in Siberia said the patient was too unstable to be transferred and that legal questions would need to be resolved before any move. Mr Navalny's team said it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital. ""The ban on the transportation of Navalny is an attempt on his life,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the Charite hospital was ready to treat him. It said the aircraft had medical equipment and a team specialised in treating coma patients on board. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. The air ambulance for Mr Navalny arrived in Omsk on Friday morning. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia has written to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday, he said transporting him by air ""may pose a threat to his health"". The hospital said it would not hand Mr Navalny over. Yulia Navalnaya told reporters she believed the doctors were seeking to cover up her husband's poisoning. ""We certainly believe that it is done to make sure that a chemical substance which is in Alexei's body will dissolve,"" she said. ""We certainly cannot trust this hospital"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 The German government said it was in touch with officials in Moscow to find a solution to the ""humanitarian emergency"". The EU called for Mr Navalny to be ""safely and speedily transferred abroad"" and urged a ""swift, independent, transparent investigation"" into the suspected poisoning. The US Embassy in Russia said that, ""if true"", the suspected poisoning of Mr Navalny ""represents a grave moment for Russia"". Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. ""Alexei has toxic poisoning,"" Ms Yarmysh tweeted. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media showed Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Another photograph on social media purported to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Siberian hospital, said a preliminary diagnosis of a ""metabolic disorder"" had been given. ""This could have been caused by a sharp fall in blood sugar levels, which caused a loss of consciousness,"" he said. The hospital says its tests have found no traces of poison in Mr Navalny's blood so far. Mr Murakhovsky said traces of a common industrial chemical used in plastic cups had been found on Mr Navalny's clothes and fingers. He earlier said there were five possible diagnoses. Deputy head doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said ""poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner"" but that doctors did not believe poisoning was responsible. Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Mr Navalny, said on Friday he had been told by a transport police official that a ""deadly"" substance had been used, which posed a threat not only to the opposition figure's life, but also those around him, meaning that protective suits should be worn. State news agency Tass cited a police officer saying: ""We can't rule out that he drank or took something himself"". Ms Yarmysh dismissed this as ""complete rubbish"".

Today, it's been edited by Helier Cheung and Lauren Turner, and written by Penny Spiller, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset and Jo Couzens.  Soon we will be pausing our live coverage for
today but, before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico.

"People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday British holidaymakers who wish to avoid 14 days' quarantine face a race to get back to the UK before new coronavirus travel rules kick in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday that those arriving in the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago will need to self-isolate. There are currently 17,000 British tourists in Croatia, according to the country's national tourist board. The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. But UK tourists returning from Portugal will no longer need to self-isolate after the country was added to theUK's list of travel corridors.,external The Portuguese government welcomed the changes and said the move ""allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Speaking about the latest additions to the quarantine list, Mr Shapps said he understood the ""inconvenience"" involved, but said it was ""just a fact of this summer"". The transport secretary also said testing for coronavirus at airports to help reduce quarantine time was ""under active review"". But he told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't want to offer false hope by saying 'it's just as simple as a test at the airport'... because it won't tell you what you need to know."" Airport tests on arrival would only pick up ""a very small proportion"" of people who had the virus without symptoms, he said, and a follow-up test would be needed around a week later. In the meantime, people would still have to quarantine. There were also issues around ensuring the second test was actually taken by the quarantining person, Mr Shapps said. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Liam and Jodie, a couple from Keighley, West Yorkshire, paid about Â£800 to travel home from northern Croatia via Munich before the quarantine deadline, after finding it impossible to book a direct flight in time. ""There wasn't an alternative. There are no flights from Pula to the UK on Fridays, only a flight from Zagreb to London runs but obviously that was fully booked,"" Liam, a mechanical engineer, said. He added that the only other flights available had stops in Spain, which is already subject to the UK's quarantine rules. Liam, pictured with Jodie, said he needed to get back for work as he had started a new job recently The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before the measures came into force. The country is continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of new virus cases, withmore than 4,700 reported on Thursday- the highest level in three months. Over a two-week period, the UK recorded 20.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people,according to,externalthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 41.7 cases per 100,000, Austria had 30.8 and Portugal 27.8. BBC News Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said British tourists are mainly staying in the coastal regions in the south of Croatia near Split and Dubrovnik, as well as the western coast, around Istria. Igor Pokaz, the Croatian ambassador to the UK, told the Today programme he has urged the UK government to take a ""more nuanced approach"" to travel quarantines. He said the virus spikes in Croatia were concentrated in certain regions such as the capital Zagreb, but there were ""very, very few cases"" in other destinations popular with holidaying Britons, such as Dubrovnik and its nearby islands. Mr Shapps said ""there is a case for regionalisation"" and the government was looking at how to do it effectively, including by having different rules for a country's islands. But the transport secretary said there were concerns about how detailed the regional data was on other countries' individual islands. He also said a regional approach would be harder to implement on the mainland where people could potentially travel between areas with differing quarantine rules. The consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was ""likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies"" and called for support for the travel industry. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the changes to the travel corridor list made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. He added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". ""Many airlines continue to operate flights and refuse customers the option of a refund, then charge eye-watering fees to those who try to rebook,"" he said. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? But Charis Hipkiss, 20, from Stourbridge near Birmingham, told the BBC she and her family have ""no choice"" but to remain on holiday in Split, Croatia, until next Thursday - meaning they will have to quarantine. ""The holiday was going well until yesterday. We're all going to be missing out on different things now,"" she said, adding that she and her parents want to get back to work. ""We've got no choice, they say it's like a race to get home, but there's no race, there's very few flights - they want to charge us nearly Â£200 each on top of what we've already paid and they're 30 hour flights."" Charis Hipkiss is on holiday with her family in Split Croatia Ms Hipkiss, who works as a carer to fund her university studies, added that they had already faced a ""difficult decision"" about whether or not to come on the holiday, which they booked before the pandemic took hold in the UK. ""We decided to go because it came down to the fact the airline was offering a maximum of Â£5 as a refund,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

BBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's.

"This video can not be played The chances of an EU-UK postâBrexit trade deal âseems unlikelyâ says the EUâs chief negotiator. A post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU ""seems unlikely"" at this stage, the bloc's negotiator has said. Speaking after the latest round of talks, Michel Barnier said he was ""disappointed"" and ""concerned"". His UK counterpart David Frost spoke of ""little progress"", amid differences on fisheries policy and state aid rules. The EU has said it would like to agree a deal by October so it can be approved by the European Parliament before the post-Brexit transition period expires. The transition periodends on 31 December and, if a deal has not been secured by then, the UK would have to trade with the EU on WTO (World Trade Organization) terms. This means most UK goods would be subject to tariffs until a free trade deal was ready to be brought in. The UK has said it will not extend talks if an agreement cannot be reached by the December deadline. UK-EU trade deal some way off, both sides say What are the sticking points in the trade talks? The EU and UK are locked in last-minute power play In a statement released after the seventh round of talks, Mr Frost said the EU had made it ""unnecessarily difficult"" to make progress by insisting that differences over state aid and fisheries have to be resolved before ""substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts"". In a bid to break the deadlock, the UK has presented the EU with a draft legal text for a free-trade agreement. Mr Frost, who reports directly to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said the UK was seeking a deal which ""ensures we regain sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters"". By Nick Beake, Brussels correspondent We were never expecting a big breakthrough this week. But the frustration and exasperation expressed publicly on both sides underlines how tough reaching a meaningful deal will be over the next six weeks. For the UK, it's a frustration that the EU is not willing to commit to paper areas of agreement until the big stumbling blocks - fishing and state aid - are overcome. For the EU, it's a frustration that the British continue to want the benefits of the single market - for UK hauliers, for example - without paying the membership fee or signing up to its rules. Amid the talk of disappointment, time-wasting and a lack of compromise, both sides insist they do want a deal. I'm told the latest round of discussions were courteous and friendly, with a warmth between the two chief negotiators facing each other - even if each is delivering an uncomfortable message. They've been sitting in the other's gaze, but hardly seeing eye-to-eye. ""When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress,"" he said. A senior UK negotiating official added that a deal was ""still possible but not that easy to get there"". They also said it was ""frustrating"" that the EU ""says Brexit means Brexit... yet they want us to continue with arrangements as though we were still [an EU] member"". ""Frustrating that they want us to move towards their position on fishing and state aid before doing anything else."" Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Barnier accused the UK side of ""wasting valuable time"", suggesting the draft text was ""useful"" but downplaying its significance in reaching any agreement. ""Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,"" he said. Fishing rights is one of the areas where significant differences remain ""Given the short time left, what I said in London in July remains true, today at this stage, an agreement between the UK and EU seems unlikely."" While there had been progress on energy co-operation, participation in union programmes and anti-money laundering, on the subject of access to UK and EU fishing waters, there had been ""no progress whatsoever"". He also said the EU's demand for a level-playing field - one of the other sticking points in negotiations - was ""a non-negotiable pre-condition to grant access to our market of 450 million citizens"". Brexit: What is a level playing field? Who really owns UK fishing rights? A level-playing field is a trade policy term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals and gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. The EU has been insistent there should be level-playing field for workers' rights, environmental protection, taxation and state aid. The next round of talks is due to begin on 7 September in London.

"Taylor Swift has sold more than 50 million albums and 150 million singles worldwide A student who received a Â£23,000 gift from pop superstar Taylor Swift said she was ""over the moon"" about the donation. Vitoria Mario, 18, set up an online fundraiser after finding she could not afford to take up a maths course at the University of Warwick. Ms Mario moved to the UK from Portugal four years ago, so is not eligible for maintenance loans or grants. She promised to graduate with top grades ""to make Taylor proud"". Speaking to BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz, Ms Mario said:  ""I didn't know what to do. Even the message was really nice. ""I don't know how [Swift] saw it. If it was someone from the UK I would be less surprised."" This video can not be played Vitoria Mario says she ""wants to hug"" Taylor Swift Ms Mario said she was already a Taylor Swift fan but was now a fan ""for the rest of my life"". The American singer, whose 16 top 10 British chart hits include the aptly titled Wildest Dreams, wrote a message on Ms Mario's fundraising page as she confirmed her donation. At that stage, Ms Mario had reached nearly half her Â£40,000 target. Swift wrote: ""Vitoria, I came across your story online and am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality. ""I want to gift you the rest of your goal amount. Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor."" Vitoria Mario said she was unable to speak English when she first arrived in the UK Ms Mario said: ""I want to thank her with all my heart."" The teenager, whose mother still lives in Portugal, said her family could not afford to support her and she needed the funds to help pay for accommodation, a laptop, textbooks and general living costs. She said that despite being unable to speak English when she moved to the UK in 2016, she left school with two A*s  in maths and an A in physics in her A-levels.

"Tightened Covid-19 measures have already been imposed in Oldham A local lockdown in Oldham could prove ""catastrophic for business"", the council leader has warned. Labour councillor Sean Fielding urged the government not to impose stricter measures in the town. Oldham has one of the highest rates of new infections in England and is one of the areas currently subjected totightened coronavirus restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""There is a big challenge in Oldham, the numbers are clear about that."" Mr Fielding told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his council was ""strongly making the case"" that a local lockdown ""would not be the right solution for the wave of the pandemic that we're seeing"". He said ""household transmission"" was driving infections in the Greater Manchester town, most cases were among the working-age population, and there had been little increase in hospital admissions or deaths. ""We already have youth unemployment of 9.5% and 15% of unemployment generally so [a local lockdown] would be really, really catastrophic for businesses and for the working-age population in Oldham,"" he added. ""It's different to Leicester because Leicester never really properly reopened."" By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Oldham currently has one of the highest rates of new infections in England, although it is some way below the figures that were being recorded in Leicester when its own tightened lockdown was imposed. In the week to last Friday, 14 August, Oldham recorded 225 cases, one more than the week before and a rate of 95 per 100,000 population. The average was 28 new cases each day. Leicester's restrictionswere imposed at the end of Juneand Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at that time its seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people. Local figures for Oldham show the greatest concentration of new cases came from the Alexandra Park area, with 44 recorded in the week to 14 August based on the data released on Tuesday evening. Another 33 were recorded in Werneth. Mr Fielding warned that hundreds of businesses in Oldham had made themselves ""Covid-secure, spent money in doing so, reopened, traded for a short time"". ""The likelihood is many of those having done all of that would simply not be able to reopen once the restrictions are lifted again,"" he added. But Mr Hancock did not rule out a local lockdown, telling BBC News ""we will do what is necessary"". ""There is a big challenge in Oldham, the numbers are clear about that,"" he said. ""We see from what's happened in Leicester over the past few weeks that where we put a local lockdown in place it then has been effective."" Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said he would be writing to Mr Hancock, arguing there is ""no case"" to impose further restrictions on the town. He said enhanced Covid-19 measures in Greater Manchester were working and that the ""highly targeted, proportionate"" approach should be continued. Oldham brings in extra virus measures Residents react to new Covid-19 measures  ""So there is certainly no case today to impose further restrictions on Oldham beyond the prohibition of social gatherings in the home,"" Mr Burnham said. He is also calling for businesses such as beauty parlours and casinos to be permitted to reopen across Greater Manchester, except in Oldham, in line with an easing of cornavirus restrictions in England. Meanwhile, Labour MP Jim McMahon wrote to Mr Hancock asking for a further two weeks to see the impact of local interventions without the ""blunt tool"" of a lockdown. The letter, which the MP for Oldham West and Royton posted on Twitter,  was co-signed by fellow local MP Debbie Abrahams and Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner.

"This year's results have been mired in controversy Teachers, parents and pupils are calling for a major re-think of next summer's exams, following the chaos which has dogged the UK exams system. Tens of thousands have signed a petition saying: ""This must never happen again,"" organised by the National Education Union. The petition backs earlier calls from head teachers for an urgent independent review into what went wrong. It comes after pupils got record grades in a switch to school assessments. A faulty algorithm had deliberately marked young people down, but in ways that were described as ""unfair and unfathomable"" by head teachers. The petition calls for plans for next year's GCSE and A-Level exams to take account the fact that candidates will have missed months of schooling. GCSE and A-level students not happy with the calculated grades awarded this summer can resit in the autumn It said: ""The exams they sit in the summer of 2021 must reflect this lost learning time and include more question choices and a slimmed down syllabus."" Schools minister was warned about exam algorithm GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid' Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress It also called for a system of teacher moderated grades in case there is further disruption to exams next summer due to a second wave of Coronavirus and further lockdowns. The NEU wants to see a thorough review of the methods used to assess pupils at GCSE and A-levels, including the possibility of more coursework. Joint General Secretary Mary Bousted said ministers showed a complete lack of trust in schools in adopting the Ofqual algorithm. She said: ""Grades were initially awarded, for the vast majority of students, with no reference to, or evidence of their individual achievements."" The leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, has made a similar call. ""It simply isn't going to be possible for all students to cover all the content in GCSEs and A-levels to the depth required. ""Most worrying of all, is the complete absence of a contingency plan in the event that large numbers of students are unable to take exams next summer."" ASCL also called on England's exams regulator, Ofqual, to consider: introducing more choice in questions so those who have missed out on parts of the syllabus face less disadvantage, the possibility of open book exams in English or formula sheets in maths and science, in recognition of the reduced time pupils have had to learn a parallel system of grading by the school, similar to that being used this year, which could help inform the grades of students who may have to miss exams Ofqual has already consulted on the issue and decided to: introduce a choice of topics for history, geography and English literature modify how oral skills are are assessed in languages collaborate with vocational qualification providers on reforms However, Ofqual has yet to decide whether the start of next year's summer exam season will be delayed for a few weeks.

"Jeremy Clarkson has hosted the quiz show since 2018 The next series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? will see a UK contestant win the jackpot for the first time in 14 years. The currently unnamed contestant answered all 15 questions correctly to become the show's sixth champion. Host Jeremy Clarkson said he was ""in awe"" and believed them to be the best entrant in the programme's history. This series wasfilmed without a studio audience, meaning the Ask The Audience lifeline has disappeared. Instead, contestants have been able to use the Phone A Friend option twice. The new series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire will begin on ITV next month. Clarkson said: ""Well, I'm absolutely thrilled and delighted that we've found someone who seems to know just about everything. ""I can't wait for the viewers to see it and I want to watch it back too."" He continued: ""I was just in awe of this contestant and think they are probably the best the show has ever had in its 22-year history. ""It was a joy to sit and watch it unfold."" Clarkson, who alsohosts The Grand Tour, said the contestant ""whizzed through the 15 questions and all of a sudden confetti was falling from the ceiling and I was saying, 'You've just won Â£1m'. ""I wasn't sure I'd ever get to utter those immortal six words and I'm not embarrassed to say, it was a little emotional but boy did it feel good."" The show's coughing scandal was the subject of ITV's recent drama Quiz But some were puzzled by the decision to announce the winner before the episode's broadcast, suggesting knowing in advance was a spoiler. ""I don't understand why ITV have told everyone that this has happened?""said TV critic Scott Bryan.,external One fan replied: ""Speaking as a regular viewer, this kind of ruins it for me. Part of the fun is the anticipation, and when you know it's going to happen, it's ruined."" But the Daily Mirror's showbiz editor Mark Jeffriestweeted:,external""My guess is 1) I think they thought it might leak 2) They are hoping it boosts ratings and people tune in every night for the whole run to make sure they see the winner."" In May, retired doctor Andrew Townsley, from Glasgow, came close to the jackpot but walked away with Â£500,000. Ingram Wilcox was the most recent winner of the top prize, taking home Â£1m in 2006. In all, five contestants have previously won the Â£1m prize on the UK version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? That does not include Major Charles Ingram, who appeared to hit the jackpot but was lateraccused of cheating in the infamous coughing scandal.His story was recently depicted in the ITV drama Quiz.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"The railway, from Berkshire to Essex via central London, was due to open fully in December 2018, but repeated delays have pushed it back. London's Crossrail project has been hit with fresh delays and might need an extra Â£450m, its board has said. The route - known as the Elizabeth Line - was initially due to open in December 2018 but has faced numerous delays. Crossrail has now said the line's central section, from Paddington to Abbey Wood, would be ready to open ""in the first half of 2022"". The Mayor of London is said to be ""deeply disappointed"" with the latest delay. Transport for London's new commissioner, Andy Byford, has been asked by City Hall to review Crossrail's latest update including any extra money the project may need. Mr Byford also said the delay was ""disappointing"" and said the Department for Transport (DfT) would also look at Crossrail's plans. The government has also launched a new ""acceleration unit"" designed to speed up road and rail infrastructure upgrades. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed that a team of specialists will join the DfT to tackle delays to infrastructure projects caused by the pandemic. Crossrail's new date comes after the team behind the project said last month that the routewould not meet its then-summer 2021 target opening. TfL's commissioner Andy Byford has been asked to review the latest Crossrail delays Currently the trains run between Liverpool Street and Shenfield, Essex as well as between Paddington and Reading, Berkshire. There is also a line from Paddington to Heathrow operating. But the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is one of the reasons behind the new delay to completing the central section of the line, which will run mostly through tunnels. The team said social distancing meant that a maximum of 2,000 people were now allowed on Crossrail sites - less than 50% of the staffing levels before the pandemic. Crossrail's original budget was set at Â£15.9bn in 2007 but cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 The project's boss said their ""focus remains on opening the Elizabeth Line as soon as possible"" and that they have a ""comprehensive plan"". Crossrail's CEO Mark Wild said the project is in its ""complex final stages"". ""It is being completed at a time of great uncertainty due to the risks and potential impacts of further Covid outbreaks,"" he added. ""We are working tirelessly to complete the remaining infrastructure works so that we can fully test the railway and successfully transition the project as an operational railway to Transport for London."" By BBC London's Transport correspondent Tom Edwards The crucial point to remember with these ""opening dates"" is no one actually knows when Crossrail will start operating. These dates are now an educated estimate but so many dates have come and gone that no one will trust the latest one. Crossrail already had problems and due to Covid-19, inevitably construction slowed down and the complex testing of the hi-tech signalling systems will now only start in October. Train testing then starts but more problems will probably crop up. There could also be more delays due to more Covid outbreaks. Don't forget this further delay has a big knock-on on TfL's finances which are already in a dire state. It will also affect all those businesses and tenants up and down the line who have been paying increased rent on the promise of Crossrail. Until it opens - Crossrail is shut.

"People will still be able to go shopping and go to work Oldham and parts of Blackburn and Pendle are facing extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19. Residents in those areas are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household, as of midnight on Saturday. Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including restaurants and pubs, will remain open. Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions after a spike in coronavirus cases. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list, and Northampton named an""area of intervention"". People will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel But tighter rules in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale are to be dropped on 26 August. Wigan and Rossendale originally faced tighter restrictions along with the rest of Greater Manchester and east Lancashire because of the wider region's overall infection rate and concerns that the virus was being spread between households. However, both have maintained low infection rates compared with other areas. The additional measures in Oldham and parts of Pendle and Blackburn will not prevent people from shopping, going to work or attending child-care settings including schools, which open from 1 September. However, any social activities indoors and outdoors can only be shared with people you live with and are in your immediate household. Residents will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel, and the number of people who can attend weddings, civil partnerships and funerals will be limited to household members and close family, with no more than 20 people. Restaurants will also be encouraged to halt walk-ins, and only seat people who make reservations in advance. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""To prevent a second peak and keep Covid-19 under control, we need robust, targeted intervention where we see a spike in cases. ""Our approach is to make the action we take as targeted as possible, with the maximum possible local consensus."" This will allow local councils to focus resources on the wards that need more targeted intervention, he added. The new restrictions on household gatherings and socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where all restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Existing restrictions in Pendle remain but the new rules apply to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden Councillor Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, welcomed the announcement the town would not face business closures. ""Over the last few days we've made a clear argument that an economic lockdown was not the answer for Oldham,"" he said. ""Instead we put forward a strong case to [the] government for a different approach - one where we increase testing, use our powers to drive compliance and enforcement among those not currently following guidelines, and carry out intensive door-to-door engagement in areas with higher cases."" He added that he believed the tightened measures would ""help reduce the spread of the virus"". Tightened Covid-19 measures have been imposed in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn Greater Manchester Metro Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""I think we've come to a sensible agreement with the government and I'm grateful to them for listening. ""We didn't want to see a lockdown in Oldham and we are pleased the government worked with us on that one - and we are glad the restrictions have been lifted in Wigan."" Mr Burnham added that he wanted to see ""further relaxation"" in Greater Manchester next week as  ""we are also seeing cases coming down in Trafford and Stockport"". ""We are balancing protecting people against letting people live their lives - it is a really difficult question and I don't envy the government on this one,"" he said. With the exception of Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have the highest rate of new infections. They are seeing between 70 and 90 cases per 100,000 people. That is about half the rate Leicester was in when it was put into lockdown. This move is about taking pre-emptive action before infections spiral out of control. What testing shows is that in these places - and a number of other areas in the north west and West Yorkshire for that matter - there is community transmission, often focussed in specific neighbourhoods. Northampton, which has the highest rate, is quite different as the cases are largely linked to a workplace. But alongside these extra restrictions, there is also a great deal of work being done that does not get the headlines. Council staff working hand-in-hand with community groups are knocking on doors, encouraging residents to get tested and stay safe. To help with this, extra testing facilities are opening up. The targeted testing of people in high infection areas who are not ill is also beginning - one of the major difficulties in fighting this virus is that significant numbers do not show symptoms. But one issue that keeps cropping up is how to get people to isolate when they have mild symptoms and staying at home means they do not get paid. Many on the ground say this needs to be resolved urgently. The spike in Northampton was ""almost solely down to an outbreak linked to the workforce at the Greencore Factory"", a Department for Health spokesperson said. Nearly 300 workers have tested positive, and employees and their households are required to isolate at home for two weeks. The number of cases has also been ""rising quickly"" in Birmingham, where the majority of new cases have been among those aged between 18 and 34, a government spokesperson said. The city recorded about 30 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. It has been categorised as an 'area of enhanced support', which means it will get additional testing, more local contact tracing, and targeted community engagement. The mayor of the West Midlands believes ""some people have not been strict enough"" with coronavirus measures. Andy Street said the city wasin ""an extremely challenging situation"".,external Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward added that the watch list should be a ""wake-up call for everyone"".

"People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday British holidaymakers who wish to avoid 14 days' quarantine face a race to get back to the UK before new coronavirus travel rules kick in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday that those arriving in the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago will need to self-isolate. There are currently 17,000 British tourists in Croatia, according to the country's national tourist board. The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. But UK tourists returning from Portugal will no longer need to self-isolate after the country was added to theUK's list of travel corridors.,external The Portuguese government welcomed the changes and said the move ""allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Speaking about the latest additions to the quarantine list, Mr Shapps said he understood the ""inconvenience"" involved, but said it was ""just a fact of this summer"". The transport secretary also said testing for coronavirus at airports to help reduce quarantine time was ""under active review"". But he told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't want to offer false hope by saying 'it's just as simple as a test at the airport'... because it won't tell you what you need to know."" Airport tests on arrival would only pick up ""a very small proportion"" of people who had the virus without symptoms, he said, and a follow-up test would be needed around a week later. In the meantime, people would still have to quarantine. There were also issues around ensuring the second test was actually taken by the quarantining person, Mr Shapps said. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Liam and Jodie, a couple from Keighley, West Yorkshire, paid about Â£800 to travel home from northern Croatia via Munich before the quarantine deadline, after finding it impossible to book a direct flight in time. ""There wasn't an alternative. There are no flights from Pula to the UK on Fridays, only a flight from Zagreb to London runs but obviously that was fully booked,"" Liam, a mechanical engineer, said. He added that the only other flights available had stops in Spain, which is already subject to the UK's quarantine rules. Liam, pictured with Jodie, said he needed to get back for work as he had started a new job recently The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before the measures came into force. The country is continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of new virus cases, withmore than 4,700 reported on Thursday- the highest level in three months. Over a two-week period, the UK recorded 20.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people,according to,externalthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 41.7 cases per 100,000, Austria had 30.8 and Portugal 27.8. BBC News Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said British tourists are mainly staying in the coastal regions in the south of Croatia near Split and Dubrovnik, as well as the western coast, around Istria. Igor Pokaz, the Croatian ambassador to the UK, told the Today programme he has urged the UK government to take a ""more nuanced approach"" to travel quarantines. He said the virus spikes in Croatia were concentrated in certain regions such as the capital Zagreb, but there were ""very, very few cases"" in other destinations popular with holidaying Britons, such as Dubrovnik and its nearby islands. Mr Shapps said ""there is a case for regionalisation"" and the government was looking at how to do it effectively, including by having different rules for a country's islands. But the transport secretary said there were concerns about how detailed the regional data was on other countries' individual islands. He also said a regional approach would be harder to implement on the mainland where people could potentially travel between areas with differing quarantine rules. The consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was ""likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies"" and called for support for the travel industry. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the changes to the travel corridor list made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. He added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". ""Many airlines continue to operate flights and refuse customers the option of a refund, then charge eye-watering fees to those who try to rebook,"" he said. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? But Charis Hipkiss, 20, from Stourbridge near Birmingham, told the BBC she and her family have ""no choice"" but to remain on holiday in Split, Croatia, until next Thursday - meaning they will have to quarantine. ""The holiday was going well until yesterday. We're all going to be missing out on different things now,"" she said, adding that she and her parents want to get back to work. ""We've got no choice, they say it's like a race to get home, but there's no race, there's very few flights - they want to charge us nearly Â£200 each on top of what we've already paid and they're 30 hour flights."" Charis Hipkiss is on holiday with her family in Split Croatia Ms Hipkiss, who works as a carer to fund her university studies, added that they had already faced a ""difficult decision"" about whether or not to come on the holiday, which they booked before the pandemic took hold in the UK. ""We decided to go because it came down to the fact the airline was offering a maximum of Â£5 as a refund,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June.

"UK government debt has risen above Â£2 trillion for the first time amid heavy spending to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Spending on measures such as the furlough scheme means the debt figure now equals the value of everything the UK produces in a year. Total debt hit Â£2.004tn in July, Â£227.6bn more than last year,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Economists warned the situation would worsen before improving. Where do governments borrow money? It is the first time debt has been above 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) since the 1960-61 financial year, the ONS said. The July borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£26.7bn, down from a revised Â£29.5bn in June. It was the fourth highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993. The three higher figures were the previous three months. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said July's borrowing figure was ""another huge sum and pushes borrowing in the year to date to Â£150.5bn"". ""That is close to the deficit for the whole of 2009-10 of Â£158.3bn, which was previously the largest cash deficit in history, reflecting the extraordinary fiscal support the government has put in place to see the economy through the crisis."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""This crisis has put the public finances under significant strain as we have seen a hit to our economy and taken action to support millions of jobs, businesses and livelihoods. ""Without that support, things would have been far worse. ""Today's figures are a stark reminder that we must return our public finances to a sustainable footing over time, which will require taking difficult decisions."" Â£2 trillion is, obviously, a large amount of money. But in the circumstances, it was inevitable that government debt would cross that threshold. Tax revenue has been hit hard by the pandemic as people and businesses earn and spend less. Government spending on programmes such as the furlough scheme has headed upwards. So the total amount owed has also increased, rapidly. But the government's borrowing costs - the interest rates it has to pay - are low. And some of the extra borrowing in effect ends up with the Bank of England, which has been buying government debt (known as gilts) in the financial markets under its quantitative easing (QE) programme. QE is not specifically intended to ease the government's financial strains - it's meant to stimulate the economy - but it does have that effect. In relation to annual national income, debt has crossed the 100% level. There's no doubt the government would rather that had not happened. But by that measure, government debt is still far short of the highs it reached in the aftermath of wars - the two world wars and the Napoleonic wars more than 200 years ago. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""not really a surprise"" that the government was borrowing a lot of money, given the size of its efforts to support people hit by the pandemic. However, he added that interest rates were so low that the government was actually spending less on servicing its debts than had been forecast before the coronavirus crisis. The ONS cautioned that borrowing estimates were subject to ""greater than usual uncertainty"". It said the June figure had been revised down by Â£6bn, largely because of stronger than previously estimated tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. Analysts reckon there is worse to come, but that things will get better after that. However, the sheer size of the debt means that the Treasury will be wary of doing anything that might make it any worse - and that means there may be less economic support for ordinary people in future. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that borrowing remained on course this year to hit its highest share of GDP since World War Two. ""Looking ahead, borrowing looks set to jump temporarily in August, as the government makes the second and last Self-Employment Income Support Scheme payment and funds the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" he said. ""Thereafter, it will decline, as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which cost Â£6.9bn to operate in July, is wound down ahead of its closure at the end of October, and firms make a huge VAT payment in March, for sales generated in Q2, as well as in that month."" However, he added that with borrowing for this financial year expected to be about 17% of GDP, the chancellor was likely to be ""relatively cautious"" in his autumn Budget.

"People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday British holidaymakers who wish to avoid 14 days' quarantine face a race to get back to the UK before new coronavirus travel rules kick in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday that those arriving in the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago will need to self-isolate. There are currently 17,000 British tourists in Croatia, according to the country's national tourist board. The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. But UK tourists returning from Portugal will no longer need to self-isolate after the country was added to theUK's list of travel corridors.,external The Portuguese government welcomed the changes and said the move ""allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Speaking about the latest additions to the quarantine list, Mr Shapps said he understood the ""inconvenience"" involved, but said it was ""just a fact of this summer"". The transport secretary also said testing for coronavirus at airports to help reduce quarantine time was ""under active review"". But he told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't want to offer false hope by saying 'it's just as simple as a test at the airport'... because it won't tell you what you need to know."" Airport tests on arrival would only pick up ""a very small proportion"" of people who had the virus without symptoms, he said, and a follow-up test would be needed around a week later. In the meantime, people would still have to quarantine. There were also issues around ensuring the second test was actually taken by the quarantining person, Mr Shapps said. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Liam and Jodie, a couple from Keighley, West Yorkshire, paid about Â£800 to travel home from northern Croatia via Munich before the quarantine deadline, after finding it impossible to book a direct flight in time. ""There wasn't an alternative. There are no flights from Pula to the UK on Fridays, only a flight from Zagreb to London runs but obviously that was fully booked,"" Liam, a mechanical engineer, said. He added that the only other flights available had stops in Spain, which is already subject to the UK's quarantine rules. Liam, pictured with Jodie, said he needed to get back for work as he had started a new job recently The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before the measures came into force. The country is continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of new virus cases, withmore than 4,700 reported on Thursday- the highest level in three months. Over a two-week period, the UK recorded 20.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people,according to,externalthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 41.7 cases per 100,000, Austria had 30.8 and Portugal 27.8. BBC News Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said British tourists are mainly staying in the coastal regions in the south of Croatia near Split and Dubrovnik, as well as the western coast, around Istria. Igor Pokaz, the Croatian ambassador to the UK, told the Today programme he has urged the UK government to take a ""more nuanced approach"" to travel quarantines. He said the virus spikes in Croatia were concentrated in certain regions such as the capital Zagreb, but there were ""very, very few cases"" in other destinations popular with holidaying Britons, such as Dubrovnik and its nearby islands. Mr Shapps said ""there is a case for regionalisation"" and the government was looking at how to do it effectively, including by having different rules for a country's islands. But the transport secretary said there were concerns about how detailed the regional data was on other countries' individual islands. He also said a regional approach would be harder to implement on the mainland where people could potentially travel between areas with differing quarantine rules. The consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was ""likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies"" and called for support for the travel industry. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the changes to the travel corridor list made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. He added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". ""Many airlines continue to operate flights and refuse customers the option of a refund, then charge eye-watering fees to those who try to rebook,"" he said. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? But Charis Hipkiss, 20, from Stourbridge near Birmingham, told the BBC she and her family have ""no choice"" but to remain on holiday in Split, Croatia, until next Thursday - meaning they will have to quarantine. ""The holiday was going well until yesterday. We're all going to be missing out on different things now,"" she said, adding that she and her parents want to get back to work. ""We've got no choice, they say it's like a race to get home, but there's no race, there's very few flights - they want to charge us nearly Â£200 each on top of what we've already paid and they're 30 hour flights."" Charis Hipkiss is on holiday with her family in Split Croatia Ms Hipkiss, who works as a carer to fund her university studies, added that they had already faced a ""difficult decision"" about whether or not to come on the holiday, which they booked before the pandemic took hold in the UK. ""We decided to go because it came down to the fact the airline was offering a maximum of Â£5 as a refund,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

BBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule.

"This video can not be played Biden takes a swipe at Trump: 'Character and decency are on the ballot' Newly minted Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden said US President Donald Trump has ""cloaked America in darkness for much too long"". The former US vice-president said his rival has unleashed ""too much anger, too much fear, too much division"". His impassioned speech was the capstone of a political career spanning nearly half a century. Mr Biden, 77, heads into the general election campaign with a clear lead in opinion polls over Mr Trump, 74. But with 75 days to go until the election the Republican president has plenty of time to narrow the gap. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do Trump's shortcomings make a weak opponent look strong Mr Biden's live speech marked the grand finale of the four-night Democratic party conference. But there was no balloon drop, cheering throngs, or any of the other fanfare and razzamatazz of the typical American party conference, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers opted instead for a virtual set piece of mostly pre-recorded speeches crunched into two hours of highly produced programming each evening. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career In his address from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Mr Biden said: ""Here and now, I give you my word, if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. ""I'll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. ""It's time for us, for we the people, to come together. And make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. ""We'll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege."" Mr Biden said ""character is on the ballot"" this November. This video can not be played How did voters react to Joe Biden's speech? ""We can choose a path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion,"" he said. ""Or, or, we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite. A path of hope and light. ""This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time."" Mr Biden vowed to heal a country crippled by a deadly pandemic and economic catastrophe and riven by a reckoning on race. He continued: ""What we know about this president is that if he's given four more years, he'll be what he's been for the last four years. ""A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cosies up to dictators and fan the flames of hate and division. Mr Biden was joined on stage after the speech by his wife, Jill, and Kamala Harris - who is running for vice-president - and her husband, Doug Emhoff ""He'll wake up every day believing the job is all about him, never about you. ""Is that the America you want for you, your family and your children?"" Joe Biden's convention speech fact-checked Joe Biden and the boy with the stutter Referring to America's coronavirus death toll, Mr Biden said: ""Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation: he has failed to protect us."" Paraphrasing the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, he concluded: ""This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme."" Call it Joe Biden's ""return to normalcy"" speech. That was Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World War One. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Mr Biden bills his campaign as a ""battle for the soul of this nation"", but his message on Thursday night - the message of many of the Democratic speakers this week - was not so different from Harding's. There was a lot of pressure on Mr Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or ""diminished"". At least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing stemwinders in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and reassuring when needed to be. Mr Biden gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it won't be because of anything that happened on Thursday night or at the convention this entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls wants. Did Joe Biden succeed in making his case? This video can not be played Watch Veep star Julia Louis Dreyfus take aim at President Trump Thursday night's climax was hosted by actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of US political satire Veep and a vocal critic of Mr Trump. Throughout the evening, Democrats who had challenged Mr Biden for the nomination praised his leadership in a taped messages. Some of those former rivals - US Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker; former congressman Beto O'Rourke, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang - could be in line for jobs in a Biden administration. This video can not be played Brayden Harrington: 'Joe Biden made me more confident about my stutter' Speakers at the convention over the past three nights have depicted Mr Trump as incompetent, selfish and a danger to democracy, imploring Americans to vote him out of office - a tone that Mr Biden echoed. What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' On Wednesday his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, became the first black woman to accept a major party's vice-presidential nomination. The daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants assailed Mr Trump's ""failure of leadership"" and amplified the cries for racial justice that have convulsed the nation. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,"" the 55-year-old said, adding: ""None of us are free until all of us are free."" Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump - who has nicknamed his challenger ""slow Joe"" and ""sleepy Joe"" - visited Mr Biden's birthplace of Scranton in the presidential swing-voting state of Pennsylvania. ""Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania,"" Mr Trump said, accusing his opponent of destroying American jobs through global trade deals, the Paris climate accord and clean energy plans. This video can not be played President Trump praises a bizarre internet conspiracy theory on Wednesday He said: ""If you want a vision of your life under a Biden presidency, think of the smouldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the blood-stained sidewalks of Chicago and imagine the mayhem coming to our town and every single town in America."" As the Democratic nominee was still speaking on Thursday, the Trump 2020 campaign issued a statement, dismissing Mr Biden as ""a pawn of the radical leftists"". Spokesman Tim Murtaugh said: ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" Next week, Mr Trump is expected to accept his nomination as the Republican candidate from the White House lawn during his party's convention, which has been drastically scaled down because of the pandemic. Mr Biden became a US senator from Delaware in 1973, working his way up to the chairmanship of the chamber's judiciary and foreign relations committees. After two unsuccessful White House campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, he became vice-president to Barack Obama, the nation's first black president, serving as his deputy from 2009-17. This video can not be played On Wednesday night at the Democratic convention, Barack Obama excoriated Mr Trump Only in February this year, Mr Biden's third run to become the Democratic White House nominee seemed on the verge of collapse. Then black voters in South Carolina's primary rewarded him with a victory that made his candidacy seem all but inevitable virtually overnight. Mr Biden has faced questions about his age - he would be the oldest president ever elected. And his lengthy centrist record has come under heavy scrutiny in a party that has been gravitating leftwards. But he was able to rally the unruly progressive and moderate wings of his party to his banner by persuading Democratic voters that he has the best chance of defeating Mr Trump.

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"Taylor Swift has sold more than 50 million albums and 150 million singles worldwide A student who received a Â£23,000 gift from pop superstar Taylor Swift said she was ""over the moon"" about the donation. Vitoria Mario, 18, set up an online fundraiser after finding she could not afford to take up a maths course at the University of Warwick.

At that stage, Ms Mario had reached nearly half her Â£40,000 target. Swift wrote: ""Vitoria, I came across your story online and am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality. ""I want to gift you the rest of your goal amount. Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor."" Vitoria Mario said she was unable to speak English when she first arrived in the UK Ms Mario said: ""I want to thank her with all my heart."" The teenager, whose mother still lives in Portugal, said her family could not afford to support her and she needed the funds to help pay for accommodation, a laptop, textbooks and general living costs. She said that despite being unable to speak English when she moved to the UK in 2016, she left school with two A*s  in maths and an A in physics in her A-levels.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

Today, it's been edited by Helier Cheung and Lauren Turner, and written by Penny Spiller, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset and Jo Couzens.  Soon we will be pausing our live coverage for
today but, before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"During lockdown many people have been running in parks and on beaches A number of small-scale outdoor theatre and sporting events will be trialled in Wales as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Events were cancelled when lockdown began in March, and mass gatherings were banned. Now First Minister Mark Drakeford has said three outdoor events, with up to 100 people, will be held in the hope more would be allowed. But he said the reopening of schools in September remained the ""top priority"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's press briefing, Mr Drakeford said parents could be reassured that children would be able to go back to the classroom. He said that keeping schools open would be the priority when deciding measures to combat the virus, if cases were to increase in Wales. ""We are putting the successful and safe reopening for schools right at the top of our agenda,"" he added. This video can not be played What's it like to run the whole of the Welsh coast - in just 20 days? Numerous mass-participation events, which raise millions of pounds for charities, including marathons and triathlons, were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic, while festivals and concerts were also put on hold. Mr Drakeford said three events would be trialled to see if they could be carried out in a ""safe way"" while maintaining social distancing. The trial will see outdoor performances run by Theatr Clwyd, in Flintshire, allowed from 27 August. Tamara Harvey, the artistic director of the theatre, said: ""It's brilliant, because not only does it mean that we can start bringing people back up the hill, but we can also share all that we're learning with other venues across Wales."" The Return to Racing triathlon at Pembrey Country Park, Carmarthenshire, will also go ahead, but without spectators, and a car rally at Trac Mon, on Anglesey, has also been allowed. Mr Drakeford said the hope was to support the sector and ""make the most of the remaining summer months where we can spend time outdoors"". The first minister said the government was learning from trials of reopening indoor theatre and some indoor sports in other parts of the UK, and it was possible other activities would resume later in the autumn. Indoor visits to care homes are set to be allowed from a week Saturday It was also announced that relatives would be able to visit their loved ones in care homes from 29 August, under ""strict"" rules to be set out. Mr Drakeford said this was one of the ""most serious decisions"" taken by Welsh Government. ""I know that there will be many families and many residents that this will make an enormous difference,"" he added. ""But care homes are such vulnerable places that it's right we take a different level of caution before we allow those visits to take place."" In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford warned ""it won't be like it was before"". ""People won't simply be able to turn up, they will need to make sure that they made the arrangement in advance,"" he said. ""It's likely to be a single visitor, the care home will have to carry out a risk assessment."" Casinos will also be able to reopen on 29 August, provided cases remain low Casinos will also be allowed to reopen on the same date, with both moves subject to coronavirus remaining under control. Mr Drakeford confirmedup to four households will be able to join togetherin an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" from this weekend. Currently, an extended householdcan only be made up of two households, but from Saturday that cap will double. A meal following a wedding, civil partnership or funeral will also be allowed for up to 30 people indoors, if social distancing can be maintained, from 22 August. Mr Drakeford said the next easing of lockdown measures, in three weeks' time, would include relaxing rules to allow cleaners and tutors to work in people's homes. It would also allow small groups to meet indoors for classes and clubs, such as book clubs and weight loss groups. Mr Drakeford said 500 businesses had been closed since March after breaking coronavirus regulations. He said incidents had been witnessed and reported to the police and local authorities ""which are plainly not within the rules"". Earlier he said things ""continue to improve"" in Wales, but the picture across the UK was ""challenging"". Mark Drakeford: ""We will continue to talk with event organisers about the possible resumption of some other activities later in the autumn"" Asked about the difference in infection rates between Wales and England, Mr Drakeford said population density was ""part of the explanation"" but ""it may not be the whole of the explanation"". ""I do think that some of what we are seeing is the result of the way that we have done things in Wales,"" he said. ""I'm not going to claim that it's the whole of the reason, luck comes into this as well as good planning. ""But the way we've tried to do things in Wales, step-by-step, trying not to do too many things at once, trying to make sure that you can have a sense of cause and effect in what you are doing, being willing to do it in a cautious, controlled way."" This video can not be played Nearly one-fifth of residents at the home died in the space of a month Karen Healey, general manager of Tregwilym Lodge nursing and residential home in Rogerstone, Newport, said she was ""slightly tentative"" about opening the care home to visitors, as 21 residents had died from Covid-19 up to the end of June. ""Although we will be opening our home up, we will have to do in a staged approach because, quite clearly, what we can't afford is to open up the home and to cause another pandemic,"" she said. ""We are also very mindful that there could be a second wave coming. I have a duty to protect my staff and, more importantly, my residents."" Lee Dirkzwager, 72, from Cardiff, who has been shielding, said: ""I did venture out on Sunday, very tentatively, quite nervous actually. ""I didn't enjoy it and came back to what I now call the norm, which is isolation. I think it's going to take a long time to adjust. ""I'm nervous to meet even family...

"People will still be able to go shopping and go to work Oldham and parts of Blackburn and Pendle are facing extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19. Residents in those areas are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household, as of midnight on Saturday. Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including restaurants and pubs, will remain open. Since July, the government has been introducing extra restrictions after a spike in coronavirus cases. Elsewhere,Birmingham has been added to the government's watch list, and Northampton named an""area of intervention"". People will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel But tighter rules in Wigan, Darwen and Rossendale are to be dropped on 26 August. Wigan and Rossendale originally faced tighter restrictions along with the rest of Greater Manchester and east Lancashire because of the wider region's overall infection rate and concerns that the virus was being spread between households. However, both have maintained low infection rates compared with other areas. The additional measures in Oldham and parts of Pendle and Blackburn will not prevent people from shopping, going to work or attending child-care settings including schools, which open from 1 September. However, any social activities indoors and outdoors can only be shared with people you live with and are in your immediate household. Residents will be advised to avoid using public transport except for essential travel, and the number of people who can attend weddings, civil partnerships and funerals will be limited to household members and close family, with no more than 20 people. Restaurants will also be encouraged to halt walk-ins, and only seat people who make reservations in advance. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""To prevent a second peak and keep Covid-19 under control, we need robust, targeted intervention where we see a spike in cases. ""Our approach is to make the action we take as targeted as possible, with the maximum possible local consensus."" This will allow local councils to focus resources on the wards that need more targeted intervention, he added. The new restrictions on household gatherings and socialising will apply to the following areas of Blackburn with Darwen: Audley & Queen's Park, Bastwell & Daisyfield, Billinge & Beardwood, Blackburn Central, Little Harwood & Whitebirk, Roe Lee, Shear Brow & Corporation Park, Wensley Fold. Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where all restrictions have been lifted are: Blackburn South & Lower Darwen, Blackburn South East, Darwen East, Darwen South, Darwen West, Ewood, Livesey with Pleasington, Mill Hill & Moorgate, West Pennine Existing restrictions in Pendle remain but the new rules apply to the following areas: Whitefield, Walverden, Southfield, Bradley, Clover Hill, Brierfield, Marsden Councillor Sean Fielding, leader of Oldham Council, welcomed the announcement the town would not face business closures. ""Over the last few days we've made a clear argument that an economic lockdown was not the answer for Oldham,"" he said. ""Instead we put forward a strong case to [the] government for a different approach - one where we increase testing, use our powers to drive compliance and enforcement among those not currently following guidelines, and carry out intensive door-to-door engagement in areas with higher cases."" He added that he believed the tightened measures would ""help reduce the spread of the virus"". Tightened Covid-19 measures have been imposed in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn Greater Manchester Metro Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""I think we've come to a sensible agreement with the government and I'm grateful to them for listening. ""We didn't want to see a lockdown in Oldham and we are pleased the government worked with us on that one - and we are glad the restrictions have been lifted in Wigan."" Mr Burnham added that he wanted to see ""further relaxation"" in Greater Manchester next week as  ""we are also seeing cases coming down in Trafford and Stockport"". ""We are balancing protecting people against letting people live their lives - it is a really difficult question and I don't envy the government on this one,"" he said. With the exception of Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have the highest rate of new infections. They are seeing between 70 and 90 cases per 100,000 people. That is about half the rate Leicester was in when it was put into lockdown. This move is about taking pre-emptive action before infections spiral out of control. What testing shows is that in these places - and a number of other areas in the north west and West Yorkshire for that matter - there is community transmission, often focussed in specific neighbourhoods. Northampton, which has the highest rate, is quite different as the cases are largely linked to a workplace. But alongside these extra restrictions, there is also a great deal of work being done that does not get the headlines. Council staff working hand-in-hand with community groups are knocking on doors, encouraging residents to get tested and stay safe. To help with this, extra testing facilities are opening up. The targeted testing of people in high infection areas who are not ill is also beginning - one of the major difficulties in fighting this virus is that significant numbers do not show symptoms. But one issue that keeps cropping up is how to get people to isolate when they have mild symptoms and staying at home means they do not get paid. Many on the ground say this needs to be resolved urgently. The spike in Northampton was ""almost solely down to an outbreak linked to the workforce at the Greencore Factory"", a Department for Health spokesperson said. Nearly 300 workers have tested positive, and employees and their households are required to isolate at home for two weeks. The number of cases has also been ""rising quickly"" in Birmingham, where the majority of new cases have been among those aged between 18 and 34, a government spokesperson said. The city recorded about 30 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. It has been categorised as an 'area of enhanced support', which means it will get additional testing, more local contact tracing, and targeted community engagement. The mayor of the West Midlands believes ""some people have not been strict enough"" with coronavirus measures. Andy Street said the city wasin ""an extremely challenging situation"".,external Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward added that the watch list should be a ""wake-up call for everyone"".

"UK government debt has risen above Â£2 trillion for the first time amid heavy spending to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Spending on measures such as the furlough scheme means the debt figure now equals the value of everything the UK produces in a year. Total debt hit Â£2.004tn in July, Â£227.6bn more than last year,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Economists warned the situation would worsen before improving. Where do governments borrow money? It is the first time debt has been above 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) since the 1960-61 financial year, the ONS said. The July borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£26.7bn, down from a revised Â£29.5bn in June. It was the fourth highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993. The three higher figures were the previous three months. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said July's borrowing figure was ""another huge sum and pushes borrowing in the year to date to Â£150.5bn"". ""That is close to the deficit for the whole of 2009-10 of Â£158.3bn, which was previously the largest cash deficit in history, reflecting the extraordinary fiscal support the government has put in place to see the economy through the crisis."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""This crisis has put the public finances under significant strain as we have seen a hit to our economy and taken action to support millions of jobs, businesses and livelihoods. ""Without that support, things would have been far worse. ""Today's figures are a stark reminder that we must return our public finances to a sustainable footing over time, which will require taking difficult decisions."" Â£2 trillion is, obviously, a large amount of money. But in the circumstances, it was inevitable that government debt would cross that threshold. Tax revenue has been hit hard by the pandemic as people and businesses earn and spend less. Government spending on programmes such as the furlough scheme has headed upwards. So the total amount owed has also increased, rapidly. But the government's borrowing costs - the interest rates it has to pay - are low. And some of the extra borrowing in effect ends up with the Bank of England, which has been buying government debt (known as gilts) in the financial markets under its quantitative easing (QE) programme. QE is not specifically intended to ease the government's financial strains - it's meant to stimulate the economy - but it does have that effect. In relation to annual national income, debt has crossed the 100% level. There's no doubt the government would rather that had not happened. But by that measure, government debt is still far short of the highs it reached in the aftermath of wars - the two world wars and the Napoleonic wars more than 200 years ago. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""not really a surprise"" that the government was borrowing a lot of money, given the size of its efforts to support people hit by the pandemic. However, he added that interest rates were so low that the government was actually spending less on servicing its debts than had been forecast before the coronavirus crisis. The ONS cautioned that borrowing estimates were subject to ""greater than usual uncertainty"". It said the June figure had been revised down by Â£6bn, largely because of stronger than previously estimated tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. Analysts reckon there is worse to come, but that things will get better after that. However, the sheer size of the debt means that the Treasury will be wary of doing anything that might make it any worse - and that means there may be less economic support for ordinary people in future. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that borrowing remained on course this year to hit its highest share of GDP since World War Two. ""Looking ahead, borrowing looks set to jump temporarily in August, as the government makes the second and last Self-Employment Income Support Scheme payment and funds the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" he said. ""Thereafter, it will decline, as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which cost Â£6.9bn to operate in July, is wound down ahead of its closure at the end of October, and firms make a huge VAT payment in March, for sales generated in Q2, as well as in that month."" However, he added that with borrowing for this financial year expected to be about 17% of GDP, the chancellor was likely to be ""relatively cautious"" in his autumn Budget.

"PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks before he was killed The killers of PC Andrew Harper have had their sentences referred to the Court of Appeal after the attorney general considered them to be ""unduly lenient"". Suella Braverman QC said attacks against emergency workers should be ""punished with the greatest severity"". PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car in Berkshire last August. Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were convicted of manslaughter. The driver, Long, 19, wasjailed for 16 years while his passengers Bowers and Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. All three were cleared of murder charges following a trial at the Old Bailey in London. At the time of the offence, Bowers and Cole were both 17. Only Long, aged 18, was an adult. During sentencing Mr Justice Edis said the age of the defendants at the time of the offence was a mitigating factor in determining the length of their jail terms. Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) The Attorney General Suella Braverman said PC Harper's killing was a ""horrific crime which resulted in the death of a much-respected police officer while he was on-duty, protecting his community"". She said she had referred the sentences after ""having personally considered the details of this shocking case"". ""Offenders should be punished with the greatest severity for such heinous crimes,"" she added. The unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme allows people to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are too low. It only requires one complaint for the attorney general's office to consider whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. The killing that sparked an outpouring of love 'No real justice' for PC Harper, widow says People often complain about sentences in criminal cases - but relatively few of the tens of thousands imposed every year are lengthened or made tougher. Last year, the Attorney General's Office considered 577 cases which met the criteria for review. Just 93 were referred to the Court of Appeal, 63 of which resulted in offenders receiving longer jail terms or being sent to prison where they had originally avoided it. It's a high bar: the attorney will only send cases for appeal where a judge is believed to have made a ""gross error"" or handed down a sentence ""outside the range"" of those available. A sentence that is a bit short, soft or low won't be changed by the Court - it must be ""unduly lenient"", in other words, very low. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their crimes"", Mrs Harper said The referral comes after PC Harper's widow Lissie and his mother Deborah Adlam launched campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Lissie Harper said the attorney general's decision was ""great news"" and thanked the public for their ""continued and unstinting support"" for her campaign. ""The sentences for Andrew's killers did not match their heinous crime,"" she said. ""It was not justice and it needs to be addressed. Police officers need to be properly protected by the judicial system."" Also reacting to the decision, Mrs Adlam said: ""My family and I know that the whole nation stands with us in outrage at the sentences handed down to my son's killers. ""We can only hope that a fairer outcome is reached by the Court of Appeal."" The maximum sentence a judge can impose for manslaughter is life imprisonment but they must specify a minimum term to be served. The scheme allows victims of crime, their families, prosecutors and the public to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are unfair. The attorney general can only ask the Court of Appeal to review a sentence under the ULS scheme if they consider that sentence to be ""unduly lenient"". It means, for example, that a sentencing judge made a gross error or imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences available. The scheme only applies to sentences given in crown courts in England and Wales. The attorney general acts independently of government when deciding on unduly lenient sentences. Source: Attorney general's office. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died Mr Justice Edis, the sentencing judge in the case, told the Old Bailey each of the jail terms for PC Harper's killers had to reflect ""the seriousness of this case"". Sentencing Long, he told the leader of the group ""although this is an extremely serious offence""  he had decided not impose a life sentence because of his age. ""A man only a few years older than you would have received a life sentence,"" the judge said. Long's custodial term had a starting point of 24 years, but was reduced to 16 years due to his age and his guilty plea of manslaughter. He will serve 10 years and eight months before he is considered for parole. The judge said a starting point of 20 years for Cole and Bowers was reduced  to 13 years each due to their ages and ""immaturity"". A date for the hearing at the Court of Appeal has yet to be set. On Wednesday, Bowers and Colelodged applications with the Court of Appeal seeking permission to challenge their manslaughter convictions and sentences.

"The family's car crashed down an embankment and into Lough Foyle A father and two children have died after their car skidded off a road in County Donegal and plunged into Lough Foyle late on Thursday night. They have been named locally as 49-year-old John Mullan from Moville, his six-year-old daughter Amelia and 14-year-old stepson Tomas. The children's mother, Geraldine, managed to get out of the black SUV and call for help after the crash at Three Trees, Quigley's Point. She was taken to hospital. A priest who went to comfort the mother after the crash described it as a ""traumatic"" scene. This video can not be played 'Sobs of the mum could be heard above the silence' ""It's a terribly tragic incident, it's just beyond words,"" said Fr John Farren, parish priest of Iskaheen in County Donegal. GardaÃ­ set up a cordon about 1km from the crash site in County Donegal He said he prayed with the mother at the scene of the crash for a short time and that she was ""hysterical from grief"". ""She was completely shocked... totally distressed, and I was with her when we prayed with the three deceased,"" Fr Farren said. ""Seeing two children lying dead beside their father, that was the traumatic part of last night's tragedy."" The priest said the father worked in a garden centre in their hometown of Moville while the mother is a nurse at Letterkenny hospital. She was taken to the same hospital on Thursday night, and is being treated for non-life threatening injuries. The priest said the couple were on a week's holiday from work and had been taking day trips with their children before the new school term started. The crash happened at Quigleys Point, on a road which runs along the bank of Lough Foyle They were returning home from a trip to a bowling alley when the car, driven by Mr Mullan, crashed into Lough Foyle. It happened at about 22:20 local time on Thursday. In a statement, GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said the car had been travelling from the village of Muff in Donegal towards Quigley's Point before the crash. They said the driver ""lost control and the vehicle skidded across the road and down the embankment and plunged into the water"". The mother was sitting in the front passenger seat and both children were in the rear seat of the car. After she got out of the vehicle and called for help, GardaÃ­ and emergency services arrived at the scene and brought her to hospital. ""It was a completely distressing scene for everybody, including all the ambulance and fire people and the GardaÃ­, the council workers and the undertakers,"" Fr Farren said. He added that the ""sobs of the mum could be heard over the silence"" as the emergency services worked to recover the bodies. Fr Farren said that despite the mother's grief, she expressed her gratitude to all the people who came to help her family. ""At the end, before she was moved to hospital, she was going round thanking everybody for what they had done, which was an amazing thing in itself that she was thinking of other people."" The deaths have left a sombre atmosphere in Moville town. Eamon McLaughlin, who lives in the area, described the family as ""popular, good-living people"". He told BBC Radio Foyle that everyone is praying for them. Another woman said a local resident was part of the rescue team and he did not realise the bodies he helped pull out of the water were his neighbours. The bodies were taken to the hospital's mortuary where post mortems will take place. There was heavy rain in the area at the time of the crash.

"UK government debt has risen above Â£2 trillion for the first time amid heavy spending to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Spending on measures such as the furlough scheme means the debt figure now equals the value of everything the UK produces in a year. Total debt hit Â£2.004tn in July, Â£227.6bn more than last year,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Economists warned the situation would worsen before improving. Where do governments borrow money? It is the first time debt has been above 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) since the 1960-61 financial year, the ONS said. The July borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£26.7bn, down from a revised Â£29.5bn in June. It was the fourth highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993. The three higher figures were the previous three months. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said July's borrowing figure was ""another huge sum and pushes borrowing in the year to date to Â£150.5bn"". ""That is close to the deficit for the whole of 2009-10 of Â£158.3bn, which was previously the largest cash deficit in history, reflecting the extraordinary fiscal support the government has put in place to see the economy through the crisis."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""This crisis has put the public finances under significant strain as we have seen a hit to our economy and taken action to support millions of jobs, businesses and livelihoods. ""Without that support, things would have been far worse. ""Today's figures are a stark reminder that we must return our public finances to a sustainable footing over time, which will require taking difficult decisions."" Â£2 trillion is, obviously, a large amount of money. But in the circumstances, it was inevitable that government debt would cross that threshold. Tax revenue has been hit hard by the pandemic as people and businesses earn and spend less. Government spending on programmes such as the furlough scheme has headed upwards. So the total amount owed has also increased, rapidly. But the government's borrowing costs - the interest rates it has to pay - are low. And some of the extra borrowing in effect ends up with the Bank of England, which has been buying government debt (known as gilts) in the financial markets under its quantitative easing (QE) programme. QE is not specifically intended to ease the government's financial strains - it's meant to stimulate the economy - but it does have that effect. In relation to annual national income, debt has crossed the 100% level. There's no doubt the government would rather that had not happened. But by that measure, government debt is still far short of the highs it reached in the aftermath of wars - the two world wars and the Napoleonic wars more than 200 years ago. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""not really a surprise"" that the government was borrowing a lot of money, given the size of its efforts to support people hit by the pandemic. However, he added that interest rates were so low that the government was actually spending less on servicing its debts than had been forecast before the coronavirus crisis. The ONS cautioned that borrowing estimates were subject to ""greater than usual uncertainty"". It said the June figure had been revised down by Â£6bn, largely because of stronger than previously estimated tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. Analysts reckon there is worse to come, but that things will get better after that. However, the sheer size of the debt means that the Treasury will be wary of doing anything that might make it any worse - and that means there may be less economic support for ordinary people in future. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that borrowing remained on course this year to hit its highest share of GDP since World War Two. ""Looking ahead, borrowing looks set to jump temporarily in August, as the government makes the second and last Self-Employment Income Support Scheme payment and funds the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" he said. ""Thereafter, it will decline, as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which cost Â£6.9bn to operate in July, is wound down ahead of its closure at the end of October, and firms make a huge VAT payment in March, for sales generated in Q2, as well as in that month."" However, he added that with borrowing for this financial year expected to be about 17% of GDP, the chancellor was likely to be ""relatively cautious"" in his autumn Budget.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"This video can not be played Biden takes a swipe at Trump: 'Character and decency are on the ballot' Newly minted Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden said US President Donald Trump has ""cloaked America in darkness for much too long"". The former US vice-president said his rival has unleashed ""too much anger, too much fear, too much division"". His impassioned speech was the capstone of a political career spanning nearly half a century. Mr Biden, 77, heads into the general election campaign with a clear lead in opinion polls over Mr Trump, 74. But with 75 days to go until the election the Republican president has plenty of time to narrow the gap. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do Trump's shortcomings make a weak opponent look strong Mr Biden's live speech marked the grand finale of the four-night Democratic party conference. But there was no balloon drop, cheering throngs, or any of the other fanfare and razzamatazz of the typical American party conference, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers opted instead for a virtual set piece of mostly pre-recorded speeches crunched into two hours of highly produced programming each evening. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career In his address from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Mr Biden said: ""Here and now, I give you my word, if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. ""I'll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. ""It's time for us, for we the people, to come together. And make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. ""We'll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege."" Mr Biden said ""character is on the ballot"" this November. This video can not be played How did voters react to Joe Biden's speech? ""We can choose a path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion,"" he said. ""Or, or, we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite. A path of hope and light. ""This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time."" Mr Biden vowed to heal a country crippled by a deadly pandemic and economic catastrophe and riven by a reckoning on race. He continued: ""What we know about this president is that if he's given four more years, he'll be what he's been for the last four years. ""A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cosies up to dictators and fan the flames of hate and division. Mr Biden was joined on stage after the speech by his wife, Jill, and Kamala Harris - who is running for vice-president - and her husband, Doug Emhoff ""He'll wake up every day believing the job is all about him, never about you. ""Is that the America you want for you, your family and your children?"" Joe Biden's convention speech fact-checked Joe Biden and the boy with the stutter Referring to America's coronavirus death toll, Mr Biden said: ""Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation: he has failed to protect us."" Paraphrasing the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, he concluded: ""This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme."" Call it Joe Biden's ""return to normalcy"" speech. That was Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World War One. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Mr Biden bills his campaign as a ""battle for the soul of this nation"", but his message on Thursday night - the message of many of the Democratic speakers this week - was not so different from Harding's. There was a lot of pressure on Mr Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or ""diminished"". At least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing stemwinders in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and reassuring when needed to be. Mr Biden gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it won't be because of anything that happened on Thursday night or at the convention this entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls wants. Did Joe Biden succeed in making his case? This video can not be played Watch Veep star Julia Louis Dreyfus take aim at President Trump Thursday night's climax was hosted by actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of US political satire Veep and a vocal critic of Mr Trump. Throughout the evening, Democrats who had challenged Mr Biden for the nomination praised his leadership in a taped messages. Some of those former rivals - US Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker; former congressman Beto O'Rourke, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang - could be in line for jobs in a Biden administration. This video can not be played Brayden Harrington: 'Joe Biden made me more confident about my stutter' Speakers at the convention over the past three nights have depicted Mr Trump as incompetent, selfish and a danger to democracy, imploring Americans to vote him out of office - a tone that Mr Biden echoed. What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' On Wednesday his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, became the first black woman to accept a major party's vice-presidential nomination. The daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants assailed Mr Trump's ""failure of leadership"" and amplified the cries for racial justice that have convulsed the nation. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,"" the 55-year-old said, adding: ""None of us are free until all of us are free."" Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump - who has nicknamed his challenger ""slow Joe"" and ""sleepy Joe"" - visited Mr Biden's birthplace of Scranton in the presidential swing-voting state of Pennsylvania. ""Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania,"" Mr Trump said, accusing his opponent of destroying American jobs through global trade deals, the Paris climate accord and clean energy plans. This video can not be played President Trump praises a bizarre internet conspiracy theory on Wednesday He said: ""If you want a vision of your life under a Biden presidency, think of the smouldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the blood-stained sidewalks of Chicago and imagine the mayhem coming to our town and every single town in America."" As the Democratic nominee was still speaking on Thursday, the Trump 2020 campaign issued a statement, dismissing Mr Biden as ""a pawn of the radical leftists"". Spokesman Tim Murtaugh said: ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" Next week, Mr Trump is expected to accept his nomination as the Republican candidate from the White House lawn during his party's convention, which has been drastically scaled down because of the pandemic. Mr Biden became a US senator from Delaware in 1973, working his way up to the chairmanship of the chamber's judiciary and foreign relations committees. After two unsuccessful White House campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, he became vice-president to Barack Obama, the nation's first black president, serving as his deputy from 2009-17. This video can not be played On Wednesday night at the Democratic convention, Barack Obama excoriated Mr Trump Only in February this year, Mr Biden's third run to become the Democratic White House nominee seemed on the verge of collapse. Then black voters in South Carolina's primary rewarded him with a victory that made his candidacy seem all but inevitable virtually overnight. Mr Biden has faced questions about his age - he would be the oldest president ever elected. And his lengthy centrist record has come under heavy scrutiny in a party that has been gravitating leftwards. But he was able to rally the unruly progressive and moderate wings of his party to his banner by persuading Democratic voters that he has the best chance of defeating Mr Trump.

"The family's car crashed down an embankment and into Lough Foyle A father and two children have died after their car skidded off a road in County Donegal and plunged into Lough Foyle late on Thursday night. They have been named locally as 49-year-old John Mullan from Moville, his six-year-old daughter Amelia and 14-year-old stepson Tomas. The children's mother, Geraldine, managed to get out of the black SUV and call for help after the crash at Three Trees, Quigley's Point. She was taken to hospital. A priest who went to comfort the mother after the crash described it as a ""traumatic"" scene. This video can not be played 'Sobs of the mum could be heard above the silence' ""It's a terribly tragic incident, it's just beyond words,"" said Fr John Farren, parish priest of Iskaheen in County Donegal. GardaÃ­ set up a cordon about 1km from the crash site in County Donegal He said he prayed with the mother at the scene of the crash for a short time and that she was ""hysterical from grief"". ""She was completely shocked... totally distressed, and I was with her when we prayed with the three deceased,"" Fr Farren said. ""Seeing two children lying dead beside their father, that was the traumatic part of last night's tragedy."" The priest said the father worked in a garden centre in their hometown of Moville while the mother is a nurse at Letterkenny hospital. She was taken to the same hospital on Thursday night, and is being treated for non-life threatening injuries. The priest said the couple were on a week's holiday from work and had been taking day trips with their children before the new school term started. The crash happened at Quigleys Point, on a road which runs along the bank of Lough Foyle They were returning home from a trip to a bowling alley when the car, driven by Mr Mullan, crashed into Lough Foyle. It happened at about 22:20 local time on Thursday. In a statement, GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said the car had been travelling from the village of Muff in Donegal towards Quigley's Point before the crash. They said the driver ""lost control and the vehicle skidded across the road and down the embankment and plunged into the water"". The mother was sitting in the front passenger seat and both children were in the rear seat of the car. After she got out of the vehicle and called for help, GardaÃ­ and emergency services arrived at the scene and brought her to hospital. ""It was a completely distressing scene for everybody, including all the ambulance and fire people and the GardaÃ­, the council workers and the undertakers,"" Fr Farren said. He added that the ""sobs of the mum could be heard over the silence"" as the emergency services worked to recover the bodies. Fr Farren said that despite the mother's grief, she expressed her gratitude to all the people who came to help her family. ""At the end, before she was moved to hospital, she was going round thanking everybody for what they had done, which was an amazing thing in itself that she was thinking of other people."" The deaths have left a sombre atmosphere in Moville town. Eamon McLaughlin, who lives in the area, described the family as ""popular, good-living people"". He told BBC Radio Foyle that everyone is praying for them. Another woman said a local resident was part of the rescue team and he did not realise the bodies he helped pull out of the water were his neighbours. The bodies were taken to the hospital's mortuary where post mortems will take place. There was heavy rain in the area at the time of the crash. GardaÃ­ have appealed to anyone who saw a Black Mitsubishi ASX in the area after 22:00 local time on Thursday, or who has dash cam footage of the road at the time, to contact them. The vehicle's registration number is 11 DL 1566. 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Taylor Swift has sold more than 50 million albums and 150 million singles worldwide A student who received a Â£23,000 gift from pop superstar Taylor Swift said she was ""over the moon"" about the donation. Vitoria Mario, 18, set up an online fundraiser after finding she could not afford to take up a maths course at the University of Warwick. Ms Mario moved to the UK from Portugal four years ago, so is not eligible for maintenance loans or grants. She promised to graduate with top grades ""to make Taylor proud"". Speaking to BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz, Ms Mario said:  ""I didn't know what to do. Even the message was really nice. ""I don't know how [Swift] saw it. If it was someone from the UK I would be less surprised."" This video can not be played Vitoria Mario says she ""wants to hug"" Taylor Swift Ms Mario said she was already a Taylor Swift fan but was now a fan ""for the rest of my life"". The American singer, whose 16 top 10 British chart hits include the aptly titled Wildest Dreams, wrote a message on Ms Mario's fundraising page as she confirmed her donation. At that stage, Ms Mario had reached nearly half her Â£40,000 target. Swift wrote: ""Vitoria, I came across your story online and am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality. ""I want to gift you the rest of your goal amount.

"Coronavirus cases have more than doubled in Birmingham, leading to concerns it may be heading for lockdown Birmingham has been added to a watchlist as an ""area of enhanced support"", amid growing concerns about a rise in coronavirus cases in the city. Birmingham will see more testing and the health secretary is meeting city leaders to discuss further steps. Cases of Covid-19 are rising quickly, with 31 cases per 100,000 last week. More than half of these cases were people aged 18 to 34. Birmingham council leader Ian Ward said it was a ""wake-up call for everyone"". Birmingham City Council is also calling for more drive-in and walk-in testing sites The Labour leader said the council would announce ""as soon as possible"" what this meant for people in the city. ""If our previous warnings to keep doing the basics haven't been enough, this has to be the wake-up call for everyone,"" he said. ""Wash your hands, wear face coverings wherever possible, keep two metres apart from others and get tested if you have Covid-19 symptoms."" West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, who is taking part in the meeting with Matt Hancock, said some people ""had not been strict enough"" in keeping up the basic steps. ""People across the region have made an enormous sacrifice since the start of lockdown to keep the virus at bay, but the virus is now returning and recent efforts to counter that have been insufficient,"" he said, urging people to ""re-double their efforts"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands It comes a week after statistics showedthe rate of infection had more than doubled. The infection rate is below levels in Leicester and parts of northern England when measures were introduced there. Figures published on Friday showed a rate of 25.5 new cases per 100,000 people in Birmingham in the seven days to 18 August, down from 29.2. Businesses in the city must enforce government advice to prevent a local lockdown, the council said. It stated they must ensure bookings were not taken for over six people and for parties from more than two households, as well as other measures including social distancing. New coronavirus cases in Birmingham have been increasing for a few weeks. Some 351 were recorded in the week to 16 August, up from 256 the week before and 144 the week before that. And as a city of more than a million people, that worked out at just under 31 per 100,000 residents last week. While cases are rising, the figures are well belowareas such as Northampton, where the rate of infection stands at 116.6 cases per 100,000 people, andOldham, where the rate is 86.9. Across the whole of England, the rate was 12 per 100,000. Birmingham is within the top 20 of the 315 local authority areas in England for new cases. The breakdown of cases in Birmingham shows 15 recorded last week in Handsworth South, with Birchfield West, Rotton Park and Bordesley also recording more than 10 each. Birmingham City Council said it must boost testing as coronavirus cases rise Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in the West Midlands, said that despite the increase ""our hospitals are relatively empty of patients with this condition"". ""We're seeing very few patients admitted to hospital let alone requiring intensive care,"" he said, adding: ""It's true that testing at the moment is identifying a younger population who don't tend to become as seriously ill."" Every week, PHE publishes a list of areas it is concerned about based on new coronavirus infection rates and other local intelligence. These places are categorised as either ""areas of concern"", ""areas of enhanced support"" or ""areas of intervention"", and measures range from increased testing to stricter lockdowns. In parts of the country in ""intervention"", such as Greater Manchester, restrictions have had to be imposed that are different to the rest of England, such as banning households from meeting indoors. One rung down from this is an ""area of enhanced support"". Councils in this category are given more resources such as epidemiological experts or mobile testing stations, but there are no additional restrictions to people's day-to-day lives. The lowest rung is an ""area of concern"", which involves taking ""targeted"" action to reduce the spread, such as more testing in care homes or more communication with at-risk groups. What happens if I'm in an area on the watchlist? Birmingham residents are being urged to maintain social distancing rules Birmingham City Council has already made some decisions in the past few days, includinga ban on non-essential visits to care homesand a""drop and collect"" trial for virus teststo help limit the rising number of cases. The authority has also warned that unless the situation is brought under control, lockdown restrictions from ""the dark days of spring... could all happen again"". Sandwell, which borders Birmingham,was placed on the PHE watchlist as an ""area of concern"" in July. The authority did not close shops or restaurants, instead urging those who were shielding to continue doing so, and strongly advising residents not to go inside other people's homes. At its peak, Sandwell's rate of infection was 28.1 per 100,000 people. As of last week, it was still on the watchlist but its rate had come to down to about 23 per 100,000, despitea recent outbreak at a DPD depot in Oldbury. Paulette Hamilton, cabinet member for health, believes Birmingham will have a local lockdown before Christmas On Thursday, council leader Ian Ward said the city was ""at a crossroads"". ""If we don't follow the basic health advice... we will face more tragedy in the weeks and months ahead,"" he said. ""More people will fall seriously ill, there will be more deaths and our economy will face another hammer blow."" The authority's cabinet member for health and social care, Paulette Hamilton, also said this week that she believed ""at some point between now and Christmas we will be in a local lockdown"". West Midlands Police has joined the authority in calling for residents to follow guidelinesfollowing weeks of shutting down hundreds of illegal gatherings. ""If new cases rise we will undoubtedly face the potential of stepping back into those restrictions,"" Supt Gareth Morris said in a personal appeal. ""We all must do what we can to avoid another lockdown."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how?

"Retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July as a rebound in demand continued, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalretail sales volumes rose by 3.6% between June and July. It said sales are now 3% higher than February before the World Health Organization declared a pandemic and the UK was placed in lockdown. Clothing sales grew last month and people spent more money on petrol. Meanwhile, activity in the UK's manufacturing and service sectors during August grew at the fastest rate for nearly seven years, according to a closely watched economic survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS composite purchasing managers' index (PMI),external, which measures factors such as new orders and production, gave a preliminary reading of 60.3, the highest figure since October 2013. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. IHS Markit said the growth in new orders was linked to the reopening of businesses, alongside ""greater willingness-to-spend among UK households"". But it said the companies it spoke to ""continued to note that levels of demand remained well below those seen prior to the pandemic"". July's rise in retail sales was not as pronounced as the previous two months. In May, retail sales had increased by 12% and in June they had risen by 13.9%. Sales in clothing shops grew by 11.9% last month while online shopping fell by 7%. UK government debt hits Â£2tn for first time PPE costs add to surprise jump in UK inflation Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said it suggested that ""the recovery in physical shops was more impressive than the headline figure and that shoppers are starting to return to the High Street"". However, the ONS said clothing shops had been ""the worst hit during the pandemic"" and the volume of sales remained 25.7% lower than in February. Clothing sales improved in July but remain far below pre-pandemic levels While fuel sales rose by 26.2% between June and July, they remain far below pre-pandemic levels, down 11.7% compared with February. ""Recent analysis shows that in July, car road traffic was around 17 percentage points lower compared with the first week in February, according to data from the Department for Transport,"" the ONS said. While ""the outlook could feel a little brighter for retailers"", said Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, she also warned that the pandemic was ""far from over"". ""With the UK now in a recession and many households likely to be tightening their belts as a result, spending on non-essential items may take a hit in the coming months, particularly as we approach the end of the furlough scheme in October."" The retail sector has been one of the worst hit by the lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier this week,Marks and Spencer announced it would cut 7,000 jobsover the next three months. It adds to 1,300 job losses at John Lewis and Boots' plan to axe 4,000 roles, while WH Smith has said 1,500 jobs are at risk. The IHS Markit survey of manufacturing and services companies found that payrolls had shrunk. ""Concerns about the speed and duration of the recovery resulted in sustained job cuts across the private sector during August,"" it said. ""In contrast to the positive trends for output and new orders, latest data indicated the fastest pace of decline in employment numbers since May."" The UK recorded its first recession since the financial crisiswhen the economy shrank by a record 20.4% between April and June compared to the first quarter of the year. A recession is defined at two consecutive quarters of shrinking gross domestic product. GDP fell by 2.2% in the first three months of this year.

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"Dara Calleary replaced Barry Cowen as agriculture minister last month after his predecessor was sacked over controversy around a drink-driving ban Irish Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has resigned after attending a golf dinner with more than 80 people. Wednesday's Irish parliamentary golf society event at a County Galway hotel came a day after Dublin announceda tightening of lockdown restrictions. Dara Calleary had been in post for a month; he replaced Barry Cowen who wassacked after a drink-driving scandal. The Irish PM accepted the resignation, saying Mr Calleary's behaviour ""was wrong and an error of judgement"". GardaÃ­ (Irish police) are now investigating the event for possible breaches of Covid-19 regulations. Others present at the event included the former Fine Gael minister and EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, the Supreme Court judge SÃ©amus Woulfe, Fine Gael senator Jerry Buttimer and the Independent TD (MP) Noel Grealish. Mr Buttimer, also resigned as Leas-Chathaoirleach (deputy  chairman of the Irish senate) on Friday morning and apologised unreservedly for attending the event, which he said was ""an unintended but serious lapse of judgement"". Mr Calleary apologised profusely in a series of tweets late on Thursday, saying that in light of the updated public health guidance, he should not have attended the event. Allow Twitter content?

""I wish to apologise unreservedly to the public, from whom we are asking quite a lot at this difficult time."" In a statement on Friday, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said: ""People all over the country have made very difficult, personal sacrifices in their family lives and in their businesses to comply with Covid regulations. ""This event should not have gone ahead in the manner it did, given the government decision of last Tuesday."" TÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said the event should not have happened and that he has removed the party whip from three Fine Gael senators who attended. He said he understands how difficult the restrictions have been for people and the enormous sacrifices that have been made and ""as representatives we should lead by example"". He added: ""In recognition of the seriousness of this matter, I have removed the party whip from Senators Jerry Buttimer, Paddy Burke and John Cummins."" Mr Hogan said on Twitter that he had attended the event ""on the clear understanding that the organisers and the hotel concerned had been assured [by the Irish Hotels' Federation] that the arrangements put in place would be in compliance with the government's guidelines"". He added: ""Prior to the event, I had complied fully with the government's quarantine requirements, having been in Ireland since late July."" The EU Commission said Mr Hogan attended the event in good faith, believing arrangements were Covid compliant. Mr Justice Woulfe, a former attorney general in the Republic of Ireland, said he attended one day of the Oireachtas Golf Society outing as a guest, but that he was ""not aware in advance that there was going to be an organised dinner as part of the event"". He said he had attended based on the understanding that the event would be within the public health guidelines, and would ""never disregard governmental or health authorities advice regarding public health"". ""That I ended up in a situation where breaches may have occurred, is of great regret to me, and for which I am sorry. ""I unreservedly apologise."" Mr Grealish, who is captain of the golf society, has also apologised. He told Galway Bay FM he sat at a table with six people and maintained social distancing. He claimed he was assured the event met new public health guidelines, but now realised his error of judgement. Analysis: Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin correspondent Dara Calleary has now joined Michelle O'Neill and Dominic Cummings as a senior person in political life in the UK and Ireland caught-up in a controversy over whether they broke their own Covid-19 rules. Unlike Mr Calleary, the other two did not resign. And so the new Taoiseach, MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, is now looking for his third agriculture minister in less than two months. It has been a bad start for the new coalition government with not even the summer recess providing a break from political mishap. Once again the issue - as was the case in Northern Ireland and England - was whether senior political figures broke their own administration's rules, giving rise to the impression that there is one rule for ordinary people and another for the political elite. But it's not just the Fianna FÃ¡il part of the coalition government that has been caught up in this affair. With Jerry Buttimer's resignation, pressure is now building on some associated with Fine Gael including the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan and SÃ©amus Woulfe, a supreme court judge and former attorney general in a Fine Gael-led government. Dara Calleary is not to be the only casualty of the Irish parliamentary golf dinner. The 81 people at the County Galway event were split across two rooms. In tightening Irish lockdown restrictions on Tuesday, the number of people allowed to attend indoor gatherings was reduced from 50 to six, with some exceptions. MicheÃ¡l Martin will now have to appoint his third Agriculture minister since the end of June, when his coalition government was elected Sinn FÃ©in health spokesperson David Cullinane said politicians who breached regulations at the event ""should resign"", especially if they are involved in setting the guidance. He told Irish broadcaster RTÃ the golf event was a breach of the rules. Mr Cullinane's party colleagues in Northern Ireland have previously faced criticism for alleged breaches of regulations set by the Executive. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and other senior Sinn FÃ©in figures maintain they acted within guidance in attendingthe funeral of veteran republican Bobby Storeyin Belfast in June. James Sweeney, from the Station House Hotel where the event was held,told RTÃ he had checked,externalwith the Irish Hotels Federation to ensure the event was compliant. He said he was told it would be, if the guests were in two separate rooms, with fewer than 50 people in each. MicheÃ¡l Martin will now have to appoint his third agriculture minister since the end of June when his coalition government was elected. The Republic's cabinet is due to meet later on Friday to discuss easing the local lockdowns in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare.

"Scientists say the loss of ice in Greenland lurched forward again last year, breaking the previous record by 15%. Anew analysis,externalsays that the scale of the melt was ""unprecedented"" in records dating back to 1948. High pressure systems that became blocked over Greenland last Summer were the immediate cause of the huge losses. But the authors say ongoing emissions of carbon are pushing Greenland into an era of more extreme melting. Greenland's ice faces melting 'death sentence' UN panel signals red alert on 'Blue Planet' Dams played key role in limiting sea level rise The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Over the past 30 years, Greenland's contribution to global sea levels has grown significantly as ice losses have increased. Amajor international report on Greenland released last Decemberconcluded that it was losing ice seven times faster than it was during the 1990s. Today's new study shows that trend is continuing. Using data from the Grace and Grace-FO satellites, as well as climate models, the authors conclude that across the full year Greenland lost 532 gigatonnes of ice - a significant increase on 2012. The researchers say the loss is the equivalent of adding 1.5mm to global mean sea levels, approximately 40% of the average rise in one year. Climate scientist Steffen Olsen took this picture while travelling across melted sea-ice in north-west Greenland in 2019 According to a calculation by Danish climate scientist Martin Stendel, the 2019 losses would be enough to cover the entire UK with around 2.5 metres of melt water. Both last year and 2012 were marked by ""blocking"" events, the researchers say, where disturbances in the jet stream saw high pressure systems become stuck over Greenland, resulting in enhanced melting. ""We seem to have entered a realm of more and more extreme melt in Greenland,"" said lead author Dr Ingo Sasgen, from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. ""It's expected that something like the 2019 or 2012 years will be repeated. And we don't exactly know how the ice behaves in terms of feedback mechanisms in this vigorous range of melting."" ""There could be... hidden feedbacks that we are not aware about or that are maybe not perfectly described in the models right now. That could lead to some surprises."" This video can not be played Ice loss from 1992 to 2018 has occurred mostly around the coast (Imbie/ESA/Planetary Visions) While 2019 broke the record, both 2018 and 2017 saw decreased ice losses, lower than any other two-year period since 2003. The authors say this was due to two very cold summers in Greenland followed by heavy snows in autumn. However the return to high levels of melting in 2019 is a major concern. Five of the years with the biggest mass loss have now occurred in the past decade. ""What really matters is the trend,"" said Dr Ruth Mottram, from the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, who wasn't involved with this new study. ""And that trend as shown through the Imbie (Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise) project and other work is tracking the high end of projections."" While 2020 has so far seen average conditions in Greenland, the overall impact of the massive ice losses seen in recent years could have major implications for people living in low lying areas of the world. ""The result for 2019 confirms that the ice sheet has returned to a state of high loss, in line with the IPCCs worst-case climate warming scenario,"" said Prof Andy Shepherd from Leeds University, who is the co-lead investigator for Imbie. 'This means we need to prepare for an extra 10cm or so of global sea level rise by 2100 from Greenland alone."" ""And at the same time we have to invent a new worst-case climate warming scenario, because Greenland is already tracking the current one."" ""If Greenland's ice losses continue on their current trajectory, an extra 25 million people could be flooded each year by the end of this century."" Recent media reports have suggested that Greenland may have passed a point of no return, that the level of global warming that the world is already committed to because of carbon emissions, means that all of Greenland will melt. Dr Sasgen says that this perspective may be correct - but Greenland's fate is still in our hands. ""The rates of sea level rise we expect from Greenland, and the risk of sudden sea level rise from Greenland is drastically reduced if we stay below the warming limits,"" he said. ""The take home message is that if we reduce CO2, and we reduce or limit global warming, then also the risk for huge contributions from Greenland in the near future will also be reduced.""

"During lockdown many people have been running in parks and on beaches A number of small-scale outdoor theatre and sporting events will be trialled in Wales as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Events were cancelled when lockdown began in March, and mass gatherings were banned. Now First Minister Mark Drakeford has said three outdoor events, with up to 100 people, will be held in the hope more would be allowed. But he said the reopening of schools in September remained the ""top priority"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's press briefing, Mr Drakeford said parents could be reassured that children would be able to go back to the classroom. He said that keeping schools open would be the priority when deciding measures to combat the virus, if cases were to increase in Wales. ""We are putting the successful and safe reopening for schools right at the top of our agenda,"" he added. This video can not be played What's it like to run the whole of the Welsh coast - in just 20 days? Numerous mass-participation events, which raise millions of pounds for charities, including marathons and triathlons, were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic, while festivals and concerts were also put on hold. Mr Drakeford said three events would be trialled to see if they could be carried out in a ""safe way"" while maintaining social distancing. The trial will see outdoor performances run by Theatr Clwyd, in Flintshire, allowed from 27 August. Tamara Harvey, the artistic director of the theatre, said: ""It's brilliant, because not only does it mean that we can start bringing people back up the hill, but we can also share all that we're learning with other venues across Wales."" The Return to Racing triathlon at Pembrey Country Park, Carmarthenshire, will also go ahead, but without spectators, and a car rally at Trac Mon, on Anglesey, has also been allowed. Mr Drakeford said the hope was to support the sector and ""make the most of the remaining summer months where we can spend time outdoors"". The first minister said the government was learning from trials of reopening indoor theatre and some indoor sports in other parts of the UK, and it was possible other activities would resume later in the autumn. Indoor visits to care homes are set to be allowed from a week Saturday It was also announced that relatives would be able to visit their loved ones in care homes from 29 August, under ""strict"" rules to be set out. Mr Drakeford said this was one of the ""most serious decisions"" taken by Welsh Government. ""I know that there will be many families and many residents that this will make an enormous difference,"" he added. ""But care homes are such vulnerable places that it's right we take a different level of caution before we allow those visits to take place."" In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford warned ""it won't be like it was before"". ""People won't simply be able to turn up, they will need to make sure that they made the arrangement in advance,"" he said. ""It's likely to be a single visitor, the care home will have to carry out a risk assessment."" Casinos will also be able to reopen on 29 August, provided cases remain low Casinos will also be allowed to reopen on the same date, with both moves subject to coronavirus remaining under control. Mr Drakeford confirmedup to four households will be able to join togetherin an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" from this weekend. Currently, an extended householdcan only be made up of two households, but from Saturday that cap will double. A meal following a wedding, civil partnership or funeral will also be allowed for up to 30 people indoors, if social distancing can be maintained, from 22 August. Mr Drakeford said the next easing of lockdown measures, in three weeks' time, would include relaxing rules to allow cleaners and tutors to work in people's homes. It would also allow small groups to meet indoors for classes and clubs, such as book clubs and weight loss groups. Mr Drakeford said 500 businesses had been closed since March after breaking coronavirus regulations. He said incidents had been witnessed and reported to the police and local authorities ""which are plainly not within the rules"". Earlier he said things ""continue to improve"" in Wales, but the picture across the UK was ""challenging"". Mark Drakeford: ""We will continue to talk with event organisers about the possible resumption of some other activities later in the autumn"" Asked about the difference in infection rates between Wales and England, Mr Drakeford said population density was ""part of the explanation"" but ""it may not be the whole of the explanation"". ""I do think that some of what we are seeing is the result of the way that we have done things in Wales,"" he said. ""I'm not going to claim that it's the whole of the reason, luck comes into this as well as good planning. ""But the way we've tried to do things in Wales, step-by-step, trying not to do too many things at once, trying to make sure that you can have a sense of cause and effect in what you are doing, being willing to do it in a cautious, controlled way."" This video can not be played Nearly one-fifth of residents at the home died in the space of a month Karen Healey, general manager of Tregwilym Lodge nursing and residential home in Rogerstone, Newport, said she was ""slightly tentative"" about opening the care home to visitors, as 21 residents had died from Covid-19 up to the end of June. ""Although we will be opening our home up, we will have to do in a staged approach because, quite clearly, what we can't afford is to open up the home and to cause another pandemic,"" she said. ""We are also very mindful that there could be a second wave coming. I have a duty to protect my staff and, more importantly, my residents."" Lee Dirkzwager, 72, from Cardiff, who has been shielding, said: ""I did venture out on Sunday, very tentatively, quite nervous actually. ""I didn't enjoy it and came back to what I now call the norm, which is isolation. I think it's going to take a long time to adjust. ""I'm nervous to meet even family...

"Ru Paul paid tribute to Chi Chi DeVayne's ""kind and beautiful soul"" Drag queen Chi Chi DeVayne, best known for appearing on two seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race, has died aged 34. DeVayne, whose non-stage name was Zavion Davenport, appeared on season eight of the show, as well as season three of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. She posted on Instagram last week that she was in hospital for a chronic condition - the second time this year. RuPaul paid tribute to DeVayne, saying that he was ""heartbroken"" to learn of her death. ""I am so grateful that we got to experience her kind and beautiful soul,"" he said in a statement, posted on the show's Twitter account. ""She will be dearly missed, but never forgotten. May her generous and loving spirit shine down on us all."" Former contestants and fans of the show also paid tribute to DeVayne. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Biden takes a swipe at Trump: 'Character and decency are on the ballot' Call it Joe Biden's ""return to normalcy"" speech. That was the Warren G Harding slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a campaign centred on healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World War One. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Biden billed his campaign as a ""battle for the soul of this nation"", but his message on Thursday night - echoing Democratic speakers all week - was not so different from Harding's. ""It's time for people to come together,"" said Biden. ""This is not a partisan moment, this must be an American moment."" He spoke of his campaign being an opportunity to heal, to reform, to unite, to ""be a path of hope and light"". If he loses in November, it won't be because of anything that happened Thursday night or at the convention this entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls wants. So what were the three key things that stood out? In big speeches like this, stagecraft - delivery - can be as important as the content. Stumble, and even the most eloquent words can be overshadowed. Given that Trump and the Republicans seem to be building their campaign attacks around the assertion that 77-year-old Biden is suffering from age-related incapacity - ""diminished"" is the term they frequently used - there was particular pressure for Biden to hit his marks. He did. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do Trump's shortcomings make a weak opponent look strong He flashed righteous anger when the text called for, such as when launching attacks on Donald Trump's handling of Covid-19 and the violence at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He dialled it back when he sought to be reassuring, talking about those who have lost loved ones or are facing economic hardship. It's not easy delivering an emotional speech from what was essentially a dark, empty ballroom, but the unusual circumstances of this ""virtual"" may have worked in Biden's favour, as well. The circumscribed format kept his text taut and lean, avoiding the longtime politician's occasional penchant for senatorial bloviation. He gave the shortest Democratic acceptance speech since 1984. Biden has made thousands of speeches in his nearly half-century in public life. On Thursday night, he gave a powerful address, delivered powerfully. As if to confirm this, midway through Biden's appearance, Trumptook to Twitter,externalto attack the speech not for its content or delivery, but that it was ""just words"". A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes Ever since the end of the Obama presidency, there has been a clear and significant divide within the heart of the Democratic Party. On one side of it are the progressives, best embodied by Senator Bernie Sanders, who advocate aggressive government programmes and policies they believe are necessary to address income inequality, racial injustice and environmental degradation. On the other side are the pragmatists, who preach more incremental change and bipartisan consensus. It's a camp Biden falls squarely into. Given that Biden was the one giving the big speech Thursday night, it's clear how Democratic primary voters resolved that conflict. Biden needs to find a way to hold the support of both the progressives and those in the middle if he hopes to win in November, however. His speech on Thursday seems to indicate he's fairly confident about holding his left flank. He may figure simply not being named Donald Trump may be enough for that. While he paid tribute to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, his speech was light on ambitious, big-government rhetoric. A return to normalcy worked for Warren Harding in 1920, but will it this time? Biden's aim was to reach out to the middle - and across to disaffected Republicans and independents. He noted that while he will be the Democratic candidate, he will ""work as hard for those who didn't support me as I will for those who did"". Coalition-building is the key to winning elections. Throughout the week, the Biden team sought to pitch a tent big enough for the Republican ex-governors like John Kasich and progressive stars like Elizabeth Warren and Sanders. Now he has to hope it holds up to the storm that Trump and his team are sure to bring in the coming weeks. It's fairly clear at this point that the Democratic strategy for defeating Trump is to turn this race into a contrast of character. This week, speaker after speaker tried to hammer home that their guy, hardened by personal tragedies, had it, while the current president is lacking. In what was perhaps the most powerful moment of Thursday evening, Brayden Harrington, a 13-year-old with a stutter, spoke of how he was befriended and counselled by Biden, who himself dealt with a childhood stutter. Democrats surely hope that Americans will see the contrast with Trump, who has in the past mocked people for their appearance or their abilities. This video can not be played Brayden Harrington: 'Joe Biden made me more confident about my stutter' For days, Democrats had been talking about Biden's empathy. Now, in his speech, Biden tried to show it. ""I know how it feels to lose someone you love,"" he said. ""I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes."" Joe Biden and his son Beau in 2009 in Iraq. Beau died six years later What Biden mostly didn't show, or talk much about, were the specifics of what he wants to accomplish as president. He dwelled on things Trump has done that he will stop, but when it comes to his own policies and programmes, Biden painted in broad strokes. The one place he did dive into details was in his Covid response plan - which, to be fair, is the topic most Americans probably care about most at this point. If Biden wins the White House, however, what will the voters want - or expect - him to do? Removing Trump from office may be enough for many. But for the heavy lifting of legislating - to tackle key Democratic issues like healthcare, the environment and education - it helps to have built tacit support, a mandate, for a course of action during the campaign. At the moment, there really isn't much of a Biden campaign to speak of, as the pandemic has kept the candidate close to his home in Delaware. That may be one more thing the Democratic nominee has in common with the ""return to normalcy"" campaign of Warren Harding. In 1920, that nominee spent most of his time at home in Marion, Ohio. It was a winning strategy 100 years ago. Perhaps it will be for Biden, as well.

" How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who ""built this country"", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances. With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues. Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme. He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend ""whatever it takes"" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his ""Build Back Better"" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce ""Buy American"" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas. His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology. In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his ""build back"" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised ""tough-on-crime"" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty. However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme. Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing ""green energy"" products. Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts. The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China ""can't afford to ignore"", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the ""Dreamers"" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid. In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access. These would be paid using money gained back from withdrawing the Trump-era tax cuts.

"People wait for planes at Croatia's Split airport on Thursday British holidaymakers who wish to avoid 14 days' quarantine face a race to get back to the UK before new coronavirus travel rules kick in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday that those arriving in the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago will need to self-isolate. There are currently 17,000 British tourists in Croatia, according to the country's national tourist board. The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. But UK tourists returning from Portugal will no longer need to self-isolate after the country was added to theUK's list of travel corridors.,external The Portuguese government welcomed the changes and said the move ""allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine. Why is Croatia on the quarantine list? And other questions What are the UK's travel rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Speaking about the latest additions to the quarantine list, Mr Shapps said he understood the ""inconvenience"" involved, but said it was ""just a fact of this summer"". The transport secretary also said testing for coronavirus at airports to help reduce quarantine time was ""under active review"". But he told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't want to offer false hope by saying 'it's just as simple as a test at the airport'... because it won't tell you what you need to know."" Airport tests on arrival would only pick up ""a very small proportion"" of people who had the virus without symptoms, he said, and a follow-up test would be needed around a week later. In the meantime, people would still have to quarantine. There were also issues around ensuring the second test was actually taken by the quarantining person, Mr Shapps said. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Liam and Jodie, a couple from Keighley, West Yorkshire, paid about Â£800 to travel home from northern Croatia via Munich before the quarantine deadline, after finding it impossible to book a direct flight in time. ""There wasn't an alternative. There are no flights from Pula to the UK on Fridays, only a flight from Zagreb to London runs but obviously that was fully booked,"" Liam, a mechanical engineer, said. He added that the only other flights available had stops in Spain, which is already subject to the UK's quarantine rules. Liam, pictured with Jodie, said he needed to get back for work as he had started a new job recently The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before the measures came into force. The country is continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of new virus cases, withmore than 4,700 reported on Thursday- the highest level in three months. Over a two-week period, the UK recorded 20.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people,according to,externalthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In comparison, Croatia had 41.7 cases per 100,000, Austria had 30.8 and Portugal 27.8. BBC News Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said British tourists are mainly staying in the coastal regions in the south of Croatia near Split and Dubrovnik, as well as the western coast, around Istria. Igor Pokaz, the Croatian ambassador to the UK, told the Today programme he has urged the UK government to take a ""more nuanced approach"" to travel quarantines. He said the virus spikes in Croatia were concentrated in certain regions such as the capital Zagreb, but there were ""very, very few cases"" in other destinations popular with holidaying Britons, such as Dubrovnik and its nearby islands. Mr Shapps said ""there is a case for regionalisation"" and the government was looking at how to do it effectively, including by having different rules for a country's islands. But the transport secretary said there were concerns about how detailed the regional data was on other countries' individual islands. He also said a regional approach would be harder to implement on the mainland where people could potentially travel between areas with differing quarantine rules. The consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was ""likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies"" and called for support for the travel industry. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the changes to the travel corridor list made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. He added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". ""Many airlines continue to operate flights and refuse customers the option of a refund, then charge eye-watering fees to those who try to rebook,"" he said. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? But Charis Hipkiss, 20, from Stourbridge near Birmingham, told the BBC she and her family have ""no choice"" but to remain on holiday in Split, Croatia, until next Thursday - meaning they will have to quarantine. ""The holiday was going well until yesterday. We're all going to be missing out on different things now,"" she said, adding that she and her parents want to get back to work. ""We've got no choice, they say it's like a race to get home, but there's no race, there's very few flights - they want to charge us nearly Â£200 each on top of what we've already paid and they're 30 hour flights."" Charis Hipkiss is on holiday with her family in Split Croatia Ms Hipkiss, who works as a carer to fund her university studies, added that they had already faced a ""difficult decision"" about whether or not to come on the holiday, which they booked before the pandemic took hold in the UK. ""We decided to go because it came down to the fact the airline was offering a maximum of Â£5 as a refund,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

BBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule.

"Confirmed cases in France have been accelerating from about 1,000 a day in mid-August France has reported a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases - 4,771 - up a thousand on Wednesday's figure. It is the first time more than 4,000 daily cases have been seen since May. Meanwhile Spain, Germany and Italy have also recorded their highest numbers of cases since late April or May. Many of the new Spanish cases are reportedly among the young, while German cases are said to be driven by a lack of social distancing and travellers returning from abroad. What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave AirBnB bans all house parties worldwide 'Signs of hope' as Africa Covid-19 cases level off The UK - which has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll - registered a further 1,182 cases on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases has been accelerating since mid-August. France has increased its testing capacity and carried out 664,000 tests over the past week, the health ministry said, but the rate of positive cases has also been increasing. It stood at 3.3% for the week between 11-17 August, up from 2.1% previously and more than double the 1.5% rate seen at the end of July. Officials say the virus is now mostly circulating in major cities among the young, who typically do not have serious symptoms, and this is why the number of people being treated in hospital has not changed much. Nevertheless three more cities - St Etienne, Nice and Toulouse - have made wearing a mask mandatory in their city centres. Mask-wearing is already required in busy areas of the capital Paris. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has ruled out any postponement of the new school year, which begins on 1 September, although he conceded there ""could be local exceptions"". Pupils aged 11 and above will be required to wear masks when they are moving around schools in confined spaces and in classrooms when they are face to face and separated by less than a metre (3ft). Spain reported 3,349 new cases on Thursday, with the health ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando SimÃ³n saying that no-one in the country should be in any doubt that ""things are not going well"". ""Although the epidemic is not out of control at a national level, it is [out of control] in certain concrete ways,"" he added, quoted by El PaÃ­s newspaper. ""Things are not going well,"" according to a Spanish health official If cases continue to rise there would be ""many hospitalisations, many people in intensive care and many deaths"", he said. The country has seen 122 deaths over the past week, more than ten times the level seen a month ago. The average age of those confirmed to have the virus was now 39 for men and 37 for women - far lower than at the height of the epidemic in the country, when the average age of those infected was over 60. Mr SimÃ³n appealed to social media influencers for help in containing the epidemic, asking them to emphasise to their followers that young people could end up infecting older members of their families. ""I understand that people want to go partying, but there are ways and ways of doing that,"" he said. ""Those with influence over the population must raise awareness about what needs to be done."" The country reported 1,707 new cases, with much of the rise blamed on returning holidaymakers as well as parties and family gatherings. The Robert-Koch Institute said the highest rates of infection were among those returning from Kosovo, Turkey and Croatia. In the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, more than a third of returnees who tested positive were coming from Kosovo and nearly 20% were coming from Turkey. However, those returning from Spain and Greece made up just 2.5% and 0.5% of positive cases in the state. Travellers returning from Kosovo are offered tests at Berlin's central bus station Germany has now designated two Croatian regions - Sibenik-Knin and Split-Dalmatia - as virus risk regions and warned against travel there. Arrivals in Germany from those areas will face mandatory tests for coronavirus. Tourist Cheyenne Maschkewitz in Split told Reuters she had seen less social distancing than at home. ""We arrived here 10 days ago, it's quite different here than in Germany, like the masks - when you go to shopping they don't take it seriously, I think,"" she said. The UK and neighbouring Slovenia have also added Croatia - which recorded 255 new infections on Thursday - to their quarantine lists. Slovenia says it has recorded dozens of cases among people returning from Croatian party destinations. Quarantine rules lifted for Portugal travel However Croatia's Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic insisted that ""less than 1% of tourists got infected in Croatia"" and said a ban on nightclubs opening beyond midnight would probably be extended Italy has also reported a sharp rise in infections, with 845 new cases in its latest daily count. The number is not as high as some other European countries but it is a rate of infection that has not been seen there since late May. ""We are not in as bad a position as France and Spain, but the current situation is not satisfactory,"" said Professor Massimo Galli, head of infectious diseases at Milan's Sacco hospital. Several countries have warned of holidaymakers returning from Croatia with the virus The highest number of cases were reported in Veneto with 159 cases and Lombardy with 154 in Italy's north, and in Rome's Lazio region with 115. ""The end of confinement has resulted in an excessive feeling of false security,"" Prof Galli added, quoted by La Repubblica newspaper. He also pointed to young people returning from summer holidays, citing the example of nine people with the virus coming back from Croatia. ""I don't want to look like the one blaming young people,"" Prof Galli said, but ""every day we receive reports of this type"".

"Dara Calleary replaced Barry Cowen as agriculture minister last month after his predecessor was sacked over controversy around a drink-driving ban Irish Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has resigned after attending a golf dinner with more than 80 people. Wednesday's Irish parliamentary golf society event at a County Galway hotel came a day after Dublin announceda tightening of lockdown restrictions. Dara Calleary had been in post for a month; he replaced Barry Cowen who wassacked after a drink-driving scandal. The Irish PM accepted the resignation, saying Mr Calleary's behaviour ""was wrong and an error of judgement"". GardaÃ­ (Irish police) are now investigating the event for possible breaches of Covid-19 regulations. Others present at the event included the former Fine Gael minister and EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, the Supreme Court judge SÃ©amus Woulfe, Fine Gael senator Jerry Buttimer and the Independent TD (MP) Noel Grealish. Mr Buttimer, also resigned as Leas-Chathaoirleach (deputy  chairman of the Irish senate) on Friday morning and apologised unreservedly for attending the event, which he said was ""an unintended but serious lapse of judgement"". Mr Calleary apologised profusely in a series of tweets late on Thursday, saying that in light of the updated public health guidance, he should not have attended the event. Allow Twitter content?

""I wish to apologise unreservedly to the public, from whom we are asking quite a lot at this difficult time."" In a statement on Friday, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said: ""People all over the country have made very difficult, personal sacrifices in their family lives and in their businesses to comply with Covid regulations. ""This event should not have gone ahead in the manner it did, given the government decision of last Tuesday."" TÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said the event should not have happened and that he has removed the party whip from three Fine Gael senators who attended. He said he understands how difficult the restrictions have been for people and the enormous sacrifices that have been made and ""as representatives we should lead by example"". He added: ""In recognition of the seriousness of this matter, I have removed the party whip from Senators Jerry Buttimer, Paddy Burke and John Cummins."" Mr Hogan said on Twitter that he had attended the event ""on the clear understanding that the organisers and the hotel concerned had been assured [by the Irish Hotels' Federation] that the arrangements put in place would be in compliance with the government's guidelines"". He added: ""Prior to the event, I had complied fully with the government's quarantine requirements, having been in Ireland since late July."" The EU Commission said Mr Hogan attended the event in good faith, believing arrangements were Covid compliant. Mr Justice Woulfe, a former attorney general in the Republic of Ireland, said he attended one day of the Oireachtas Golf Society outing as a guest, but that he was ""not aware in advance that there was going to be an organised dinner as part of the event"". He said he had attended based on the understanding that the event would be within the public health guidelines, and would ""never disregard governmental or health authorities advice regarding public health"". ""That I ended up in a situation where breaches may have occurred, is of great regret to me, and for which I am sorry. ""I unreservedly apologise."" Mr Grealish, who is captain of the golf society, has also apologised. He told Galway Bay FM he sat at a table with six people and maintained social distancing. He claimed he was assured the event met new public health guidelines, but now realised his error of judgement. Analysis: Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin correspondent Dara Calleary has now joined Michelle O'Neill and Dominic Cummings as a senior person in political life in the UK and Ireland caught-up in a controversy over whether they broke their own Covid-19 rules. Unlike Mr Calleary, the other two did not resign. And so the new Taoiseach, MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, is now looking for his third agriculture minister in less than two months. It has been a bad start for the new coalition government with not even the summer recess providing a break from political mishap. Once again the issue - as was the case in Northern Ireland and England - was whether senior political figures broke their own administration's rules, giving rise to the impression that there is one rule for ordinary people and another for the political elite. But it's not just the Fianna FÃ¡il part of the coalition government that has been caught up in this affair. With Jerry Buttimer's resignation, pressure is now building on some associated with Fine Gael including the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan and SÃ©amus Woulfe, a supreme court judge and former attorney general in a Fine Gael-led government. Dara Calleary is not to be the only casualty of the Irish parliamentary golf dinner. The 81 people at the County Galway event were split across two rooms. In tightening Irish lockdown restrictions on Tuesday, the number of people allowed to attend indoor gatherings was reduced from 50 to six, with some exceptions. MicheÃ¡l Martin will now have to appoint his third Agriculture minister since the end of June, when his coalition government was elected Sinn FÃ©in health spokesperson David Cullinane said politicians who breached regulations at the event ""should resign"", especially if they are involved in setting the guidance. He told Irish broadcaster RTÃ the golf event was a breach of the rules. Mr Cullinane's party colleagues in Northern Ireland have previously faced criticism for alleged breaches of regulations set by the Executive. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and other senior Sinn FÃ©in figures maintain they acted within guidance in attendingthe funeral of veteran republican Bobby Storeyin Belfast in June. James Sweeney, from the Station House Hotel where the event was held,told RTÃ he had checked,externalwith the Irish Hotels Federation to ensure the event was compliant. He said he was told it would be, if the guests were in two separate rooms, with fewer than 50 people in each. MicheÃ¡l Martin will now have to appoint his third agriculture minister since the end of June when his coalition government was elected. The Republic's cabinet is due to meet later on Friday to discuss easing the local lockdowns in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare.

"This video can not be played 'I've applied for more than 2,000 jobs with no success' More than 1,000 people applied for one brewery job as the number of vacancies plummeted in lockdown. Northern Monk Brewing Company in Leeds said applicants for the packing job included people made redundant or on furlough. Data from job website Adzuna showed vacancies are down by 59% compared with last summer, with some areas down 80%. Tony Wilson, of the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), said there were signs of improvement. However he warned firms would still freeze recruitment and cut hours. This means that even people who are not losing their jobs will be looking for extra work and adding to the competition for a smaller number of vacancies. Sophie Lennon said applicants included people made redundant and those on furlough Northern Monk Brewing Company in Leeds had 1,021 applications for one packing vacancy. HR manager Sophie Lennon said: ""When we posted the job within the first day we had a really high number of applicants. We've never seen that before. ""We advertised the job for three weeks and at the end of that time we'd had 1,021 applicants for the job which is way above what we'd usually see."" She said she had spoken to people who had been made redundant but also people on furlough who were not sure if they would be brought back. ""It's definitely a mix of both."" Sarah Smith lost her job in May and has been applying for different roles ever since without success. Sarah Smith has not had an interview but has been applying for lots of different jobs The 25-year-old, from Leeds, previously worked for an online retailer. ""I've never really been unemployed for more than two weeks at a time,"" she said. ""It's been just under 2,000 jobs I've applied for now and I've not had one reply. ""All sorts of work - retail, cleaning, care work, apprenticeships - nothing. ""I've had one automatic response but the majority of the time they say if you haven't heard from us in two weeks, please assume you've been unsuccessful."" The Portsmouth University graduate said she was not being picky. ""These jobs aren't what I'd want to do long term, but when you've got responsibilities and a mortgage you've got to work,"" she said. ""You start taking it a little bit personally. I know how much of a hard worker I am and that makes it harder because I've not even had an interview or a phone call."" What happens when the furlough scheme ends? 'Long, long way to go' for economy Millions for small business 'sitting in council accounts' Laura Homer has been on furlough from her main job and has lost a part time one. The 28-year-old is due to return to her reception post at Yorkshire Dance, a centre in Leeds in September. Laura Homer struggled to find another part time job Her part time job as front of house at Leeds Playhouse was lost because the theatre had to close during the coronavirus pandemic. ""There are jobs in retail, but if we do have another wave and things have to close again, that may put me in the same position,"" Miss Homer said. ""I've been hoping to see jobs that would match my experience and skills, and ideally that could be done from home, but there isn't much out there. ""I get a weekly newsletter with arts jobs and lately there are about three vacancies, whereas before lockdown there would have been a long list."" Just under 1.7 million vacancies were listed across the UK between April and July, with May the worst month in more than two years' worth of data. There were 361,570 vacancies posted that month, while the country was still in full lockdown and this rose to 449,484 in July as some places were able to reopen with social distancing. Jobs in the charity and voluntary sector are down by more than 90%, with the data showing just over 2,000 adverts posted between April and July 2020, compared with more than 25,500 in the same months last year. Mr Wilson, director of the IES, said: ""Vacancies have fallen everywhere. ""It's been noticeable in ex-industrial areas, deprived cities and coastal towns. ""There was a pretty significant improvement between June and July, but it's still a long way below February. ""While there will be a rise in redundancy and unemployment, where employers can they will try to reduce hours instead of losing people altogether. ""People will still be in work, but they will be earning less and working fewer hours."" Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, was optimistic about the increase recorded in July, even though it is still well below last year. ""It's nice to see a small, month-on-month uptick across most sectors and locations,"" he said. ""Let's hope this is the start of the jobs bounce back."" He said there had been a rise in vacancies for logistics and warehouse jobs, which he said was driven by employers like Amazon, Deliveroo and DPD. Between April and June, the number of people in work fell by 220,000, the Office for National Statistics said. What jobs are available post-lockdown? What happens when furlough ends?

Today, it's been edited by Helier Cheung and Lauren Turner, and written by Penny Spiller, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset and Jo Couzens.  Soon we will be pausing our live coverage for
today but, before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors say leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny - who supporters believe was poisoned - remains too ill to be moved to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny has been in a coma since Thursday when he fell ill on a flight. His supporters called the doctors' decision ""a direct threat to his life"". The doctors say no poison was found in his body. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. German doctors have now been given access to him in hospital, one of his aides told reporters. At a news conference in Berlin, Leonid Volkov said a medically equipped plane sent from Germany was still waiting for him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he is in hospital. In a preliminary diagnosis on Friday, doctors said his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. The head doctor at the hospital treating Mr Navalny in Omsk in Siberia said the patient was too unstable to be transferred and that legal questions would need to be resolved before any move. Mr Navalny's team said it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital. ""The ban on the transportation of Navalny is an attempt on his life,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the Charite hospital was ready to treat him. It said the aircraft had medical equipment and a team specialised in treating coma patients on board. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. The air ambulance for Mr Navalny arrived in Omsk on Friday morning. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia has written to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday, he said transporting him by air ""may pose a threat to his health"". The hospital said it would not hand Mr Navalny over. Yulia Navalnaya told reporters she believed the doctors were seeking to cover up her husband's poisoning. ""We certainly believe that it is done to make sure that a chemical substance which is in Alexei's body will dissolve,"" she said. ""We certainly cannot trust this hospital"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 The German government said it was in touch with officials in Moscow to find a solution to the ""humanitarian emergency"". The EU called for Mr Navalny to be ""safely and speedily transferred abroad"" and urged a ""swift, independent, transparent investigation"" into the suspected poisoning. The US Embassy in Russia said that, ""if true"", the suspected poisoning of Mr Navalny ""represents a grave moment for Russia"". Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. ""Alexei has toxic poisoning,"" Ms Yarmysh tweeted. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media showed Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Another photograph on social media purported to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Siberian hospital, said a preliminary diagnosis of a ""metabolic disorder"" had been given. ""This could have been caused by a sharp fall in blood sugar levels, which caused a loss of consciousness,"" he said. The hospital says its tests have found no traces of poison in Mr Navalny's blood so far. Mr Murakhovsky said traces of a common industrial chemical used in plastic cups had been found on Mr Navalny's clothes and fingers. He earlier said there were five possible diagnoses. Deputy head doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said ""poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner"" but that doctors did not believe poisoning was responsible. Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Mr Navalny, said on Friday he had been told by a transport police official that a ""deadly"" substance had been used, which posed a threat not only to the opposition figure's life, but also those around him, meaning that protective suits should be worn. State news agency Tass cited a police officer saying: ""We can't rule out that he drank or took something himself"". Ms Yarmysh dismissed this as ""complete rubbish"".

"The family's car crashed down an embankment and into Lough Foyle A father and two children have died after their car skidded off a road in County Donegal and plunged into Lough Foyle late on Thursday night. They have been named locally as 49-year-old John Mullan from Moville, his six-year-old daughter Amelia and 14-year-old stepson Tomas. The children's mother, Geraldine, managed to get out of the black SUV and call for help after the crash at Three Trees, Quigley's Point. She was taken to hospital. A priest who went to comfort the mother after the crash described it as a ""traumatic"" scene. This video can not be played 'Sobs of the mum could be heard above the silence' ""It's a terribly tragic incident, it's just beyond words,"" said Fr John Farren, parish priest of Iskaheen in County Donegal. GardaÃ­ set up a cordon about 1km from the crash site in County Donegal He said he prayed with the mother at the scene of the crash for a short time and that she was ""hysterical from grief"". ""She was completely shocked... totally distressed, and I was with her when we prayed with the three deceased,"" Fr Farren said. ""Seeing two children lying dead beside their father, that was the traumatic part of last night's tragedy."" The priest said the father worked in a garden centre in their hometown of Moville while the mother is a nurse at Letterkenny hospital. She was taken to the same hospital on Thursday night, and is being treated for non-life threatening injuries. The priest said the couple were on a week's holiday from work and had been taking day trips with their children before the new school term started. The crash happened at Quigleys Point, on a road which runs along the bank of Lough Foyle They were returning home from a trip to a bowling alley when the car, driven by Mr Mullan, crashed into Lough Foyle. It happened at about 22:20 local time on Thursday. In a statement, GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said the car had been travelling from the village of Muff in Donegal towards Quigley's Point before the crash. They said the driver ""lost control and the vehicle skidded across the road and down the embankment and plunged into the water"". The mother was sitting in the front passenger seat and both children were in the rear seat of the car. After she got out of the vehicle and called for help, GardaÃ­ and emergency services arrived at the scene and brought her to hospital. ""It was a completely distressing scene for everybody, including all the ambulance and fire people and the GardaÃ­, the council workers and the undertakers,"" Fr Farren said. He added that the ""sobs of the mum could be heard over the silence"" as the emergency services worked to recover the bodies. Fr Farren said that despite the mother's grief, she expressed her gratitude to all the people who came to help her family. ""At the end, before she was moved to hospital, she was going round thanking everybody for what they had done, which was an amazing thing in itself that she was thinking of other people."" The deaths have left a sombre atmosphere in Moville town. Eamon McLaughlin, who lives in the area, described the family as ""popular, good-living people"". He told BBC Radio Foyle that everyone is praying for them. Another woman said a local resident was part of the rescue team and he did not realise the bodies he helped pull out of the water were his neighbours.

"Brent Shannon and Ethan West found the nuggets while on TV show Aussie Gold Hunters Two gold nuggets worth around A$350,000 (Â£190,000; US$250,000) have been discovered by a pair of diggers in southern Australia. Brent Shannon and Ethan West found the nuggets near goldmining town Tarnagulla in Victoria state. Their lucky find was shown on TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, which aired on Thursday. The men dug up the ground and used metal detectors to detect gold in the area. ""These are definitely one of the most significant finds,"" Ethan West said, according to CNN. ""To have two large chunks in one day is quite amazing."" They found the nuggets, which have a combined weight of 3.5kg (7.7lb), in a number of hours with the help of Mr West's father, according to the Discovery Channel which airs the programme. The nuggets weigh around 3.5kg (7.7 lb) in combined weight The show, which is also broadcast in the UK, follows teams of gold prospectors who dig in goldfields in remote parts of Australia. ""I reckoned we were in for a chance,"" Mr Shannon told Australian TV show Sunrise. ""It was in a bit of virgin ground, which means it's untouched and hasn't been mined."" World's largest gold nugget remembered What is it like to find treasure? Huge gold-laden rocks found in Australia Mr West said that during four years of mining for gold, he is picked up ""probably thousands"" of pieces. The Discovery Channel also said collectors could pay up to 30% more for the nuggets than their estimated value. In 2019an Australian man unearthed a 1.4kg (49oz) gold nuggetworth an estimated A$100,000 (Â£54,000; $69,000) using a metal detector. Gold mining in Australia began in the 1850s, and remains a significant industry in the country. The town of Tarnagulla itself was founded during the Victoria Gold Rush and became very wealthy for a period of time when keen prospectors moved there to make their fortune,according to a local website.,external Coastal erosion 'to threaten more Australian homes' Video, 00:02:30Coastal erosion 'to threaten more Australian homes' The bilbies 'thriving' after a 100-year absence.

Today, it's been edited by Helier Cheung and Lauren Turner, and written by Penny Spiller, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset and Jo Couzens.  Soon we will be pausing our live coverage for
today but, before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK and around the world: Dr Tedros says Covid-19 could be tamed faster than the Spanish flu of 1918 The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it hopes the planet will be over the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years. Its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it should be possible to tame it faster than it took with the deadly 1918 Spanish flu. He said ""globalisation, closeness, connectedness"" today has allowed Covid-19 to spread around the world at lightning speed but that we also now have the advantage of far better technology. ""It took three waves for [Spanish flu] to infect most of the susceptible individuals,"" WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. Mick Pickering's wife Patsy said: ""At some points I thought he was going to die."" Mick Pickering has been discharged from hospital after 110 days  battling coronavirus - he said he was ""amazed"" to discover he had been in an induced coma for seven weeks. The 65-year-old left Nottingham City Hospital on Friday after being admitted on 4 April. When he was woken up, he said: ""I didn't realise I'd been there so long."" Staff at the hospital lined up and clapped as he left the hospital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""He is much improved and now able to walk independently, talk, wash himself and make an all-important cup of tea."" Read more
here Learner drivers in England and Wales trying to book a driving test today have been left disappointed after thewebsite crashed due to
""unprecedented demand""after several months of suspension during lockdown. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings again for England and Wales from 08:00 BST today. It said it would release more test slots on Monday but will not be able to accept bookings for any more than six weeks in advance. The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus. Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC, said: ""The pandemic has put into sharp focus just how important the car is to so many people's lives, whether they are driving to see friends or family, having a day out or getting to a place of work."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There
are three key sources of data when it comes to judging which direction the
pandemic is going in the UK: the daily confirmed cases, the Office for National
Statistics monitoring programme (which involves random sampling) and the R
value modelled by government experts. All
show slightly different pictures. The latest ONS survey, published on Friday,
suggests rises seen since June have levelled off. Meanwhile, the government advisory
body Sage says it does not have confidence the R number is below one, suggesting
the epidemic is growing. If you
look at the daily confirmed cases, it shows the number of new infections have
nearly doubled over the past six weeks to more than 1,000 a day. But that has
happened partly because the number of tests being done has increased. Even with the increase in testing, it is clear that not everyone who is infected is
being diagnosed â part of the problem is that people can have the virus but not
show symptoms. The ONS survey suggests the number of new infections is actually
double that being identified by the testing system. Overall,
it suggests there has probably been a steady, gradual increase over the past
few weeks. But this needs to be put into context. At the peak, the UK was
estimated to be seeing 100,000 new infections a day. The
focus now is ensuring those areas that are seeing the most cases are able to
contain the spread. The scale of the coronavirus
pandemic in Mexico is ""under-represented"" and ""under-recognised"", the World Health Organization said on Friday. According to Reuters news agency, Dr Mike
Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, told a briefing in Geneva that the equivalent of around three people per 100,000 were being tested in Mexico. The US, in comparison, tests around 150 per 100,000 people, he said. Mexico has the third highest number of deaths in the world, with almost 60,000 fatalities recorded since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Two towns in the south of Tunisia face overnight curfews following a renewed spike in cases. Hamma and Hamma Gharbia will face lockdowns from 1700 until 0500 every day until 27 August, the official news agency TAP said on Friday. The governor of Gabes province said in a statement that the situation was ""worrying"", with 48 new cases recorded on Thursday. The country has witnessed a rise in cases since it reopened its borders in later June, with more than 100 per day over the last two weeks, according to Reuters news agency. As parts of northern England prepare for renewed restrictions, here's a look at the situation across the UK. While the number of daily cases have dipped, they're still higher than they were two weeks ago. But there is good news, with deaths remaining low. As we've already reported, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the number of coronavirus deaths in the country looks set to fall in the coming weeks. Butthe CDC's new forecast,externalshows that the US could pass 200,000 deaths in the next four weeks. The new figures, based on modelling from 33 groups, suggest that between 187,000 and 205,000 deaths could be reported by 12 September. The number of reported new deaths per week is expected to increase in Minnesota, while states including Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina are likely to see a decrease. Almost 175,000 Americans have died and 5.5 million have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Not finger-licking good: traces of coronavirus have been found on packs of frozen chicken wings Traces of coronavirus have recently been found on frozen shrimp and frozen chicken wings from South America and packaging in China. Butwhat is the risk of spreading the virus through food packaging? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours - or even days - on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiment used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said the chance of transmission in this way was ""very small"". Scientists do not now think that touching your eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface is the main way for Covid-19 to spread. Instead, droplets produced when an infected person coughs, laughs or talks during face-to-face contact are thought to be the biggest risk. Schoolpupils in Scotland may
have to wear face coverings in future, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested. The first minister said at her daily briefing scientific that advice was constantly under review, and there was a
""possibility"" rules would change. She
said the issue of face coverings would be discussed at a meeting of the
education recovery group today. However,
she stressed there was no evidence that coronavirus among young people was
being transmitted in schools. Asked if it might become compulsory for pupils - particularly in secondary schools - to wear face coverings on the premises, she said: ""I
do think there is a possibility that our advice on that may change."" US coronavirus deaths could begin to slow in the next week, the head of the nation's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Dr Robert Redfield said the effects of increased adherence to social distancing and other preventative measures would begin to show soon. âInterventions are going to have a lag of
three or four weeks,â he told the Journal of the
American Medical Association. âYou and I are going to see the cases
continue to drop. And then hopefully this week and next week, youâre going to
start seeing the death rate really start to drop again.â Other stories making the headlines in the US today: Two more people have died from coronavirus, down from six the previous day, according to the latest daily government figures. It brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 41,405. The actual death toll is believed to be higher. Some 1,033 new positive cases of Covid-19 have been recorded as of today, down from 1,182 on Thursday, the figures also show.  Protesters allege funds to fight Covid-19 have been stolen The Kenyan capital has been hit by anti-corruption protests, and strikes by doctors, amid growing anger over the authorities' handling of the coronavirus crisis. Police used tear gas to try and disperse a number of people protesting over the alleged misuse of funds to fight Covid-19. One of the protesters said 12 people were arrested at the rally in Nairobi's Uhuru Park. The government has however denied misappropriating funds despite earlier saying it would investigate the allegations. Meanwhile, some 300 doctors in the city's public hospitals have gone on strike calling for better pay and working conditions including personal protective equipment (PPE). One doctor said ""we... will not play Russian roulette with the government anymore"". Out of the more than 30,000 cases in Kenya, close to 700 of those infected are healthcare workers, and several have died, the BBC's Rhoda Odhiambo in Nairobi reports.  Britons in Dubrovnik faced the choice of an early return or two weeks of quarantine With quarantine restrictions being placed on another set of countries, Your Questions Answered is tackling some ofyour queries about the dos and don'ts of travel in the pandemic. Steve in Fareham asked about Croatia and quarantine measures. Q: What does a country like Croatia have to do to be put back on the UK list of countries where two weeks' isolation on return is unnecessary? A: It's not entirely clear. At the moment, the government does not publish the criteria for its decisions regarding quarantine, although it is thought to take into account a number of factors, such as the number of people affected, the number of deaths and the country's testing capacity. Croatia was put on the list because it has recently seen a spike in infections. There have been calls for more transparency about the process. Earlier this month, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee urged the government to publish the analysis behind its decisions, saying: ""It will build more support for the difficult balancing judgements it has to take if it is open about the evidence behind them."" Pupils are being asked to travel to school in the autumn without using public transport Pupils shouldnât use public transport to get to and from school unless they have to, according tonew government guidance,external. The Department for Education says this is to ensure thereâs enough capacity on buses, trams and trains for those who have no other way of getting there. The guidance says children and teenagers can share a car to school with someone outside of their support bubble or household, so long as they share with the same people each time, keep the windows open for ventilation and wear a face covering if theyâre older than 11. It also states that schools and colleges may need to stagger or adjust start and finish times to keep groups apart â but says this should not affect how long children spend in lessons. Schools in Berlin resumed teaching two weeks ago Coronavirus infections have been reported at more than 40 schools in the German capital Berlin, just two weeks after schools resumed teaching, a local newspaper says. The daily Berliner Zeitung reports,externalthat dozens of teaching staff and hundreds of students are currently in quarantine across Berlin following confirmed infections. The city has a total of 825 schools. While the quarantine numbers may seem alarming, the newspaper argues that the figures actually show that the systems in place are working. ""In most cases, only one student, teacher or member of staff is infected and so far there have been no cases of infections inside a school,"" it said. Nonetheless, there are concerns over how quickly the virus can spread and whether protective measures are strong enough - school children in the capital are required to wear masks in hallways, during breaks and when entering classrooms, but are allowed to take them off during lessons. Coronavirus cases in Germany have been rising since the end of July, with officials blaming the increase on returning holidaymakers and social gatherings. The issue of masks in schools has been considered elsewhere, with France announcing late on Thursday that all pupils above the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings when teaching resumes in just over a week. The ban on landlords evicting tenants in England has been extendeduntil 20 September. Courts were due to resume eviction proceedings on Monday, sparking fears for about 230,000 renters who had fallen into arrears since the pandemic began. Charities, health bodies and renters argued that the ban should stay in place because of the financial impact of the crisis. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus.â But the National Residential Landlords Association said the blanket extension was ""unacceptable"", adding that landlords ""cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failureâ. The R number - the rate of reproduction - of coronavirus in the UK has risen to between 0.9-1.1, according to the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The figures suggest there is a risk that the overall coronavirus epidemic in the UK is growing, government scientists say. The latest growth rate for the whole of the UK is between minus 3% to plus 1%, a slight change from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The growth rate of Covid-19 transmission reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors say leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny - who supporters believe was poisoned - remains too ill to be moved to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny has been in a coma since Thursday when he fell ill on a flight. His supporters called the doctors' decision ""a direct threat to his life"". The doctors say no poison was found in his body. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. German doctors have now been given access to him in hospital, one of his aides told reporters. At a news conference in Berlin, Leonid Volkov said a medically equipped plane sent from Germany was still waiting for him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he is in hospital. In a preliminary diagnosis on Friday, doctors said his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. The head doctor at the hospital treating Mr Navalny in Omsk in Siberia said the patient was too unstable to be transferred and that legal questions would need to be resolved before any move. Mr Navalny's team said it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital. ""The ban on the transportation of Navalny is an attempt on his life,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the Charite hospital was ready to treat him. It said the aircraft had medical equipment and a team specialised in treating coma patients on board. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. The air ambulance for Mr Navalny arrived in Omsk on Friday morning. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia has written to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday, he said transporting him by air ""may pose a threat to his health"". The hospital said it would not hand Mr Navalny over. Yulia Navalnaya told reporters she believed the doctors were seeking to cover up her husband's poisoning. ""We certainly believe that it is done to make sure that a chemical substance which is in Alexei's body will dissolve,"" she said. ""We certainly cannot trust this hospital"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 The German government said it was in touch with officials in Moscow to find a solution to the ""humanitarian emergency"". The EU called for Mr Navalny to be ""safely and speedily transferred abroad"" and urged a ""swift, independent, transparent investigation"" into the suspected poisoning. The US Embassy in Russia said that, ""if true"", the suspected poisoning of Mr Navalny ""represents a grave moment for Russia"". Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. ""Alexei has toxic poisoning,"" Ms Yarmysh tweeted. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media showed Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Another photograph on social media purported to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Siberian hospital, said a preliminary diagnosis of a ""metabolic disorder"" had been given. ""This could have been caused by a sharp fall in blood sugar levels, which caused a loss of consciousness,"" he said. The hospital says its tests have found no traces of poison in Mr Navalny's blood so far. Mr Murakhovsky said traces of a common industrial chemical used in plastic cups had been found on Mr Navalny's clothes and fingers. He earlier said there were five possible diagnoses. Deputy head doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said ""poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner"" but that doctors did not believe poisoning was responsible. Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Mr Navalny, said on Friday he had been told by a transport police official that a ""deadly"" substance had been used, which posed a threat not only to the opposition figure's life, but also those around him, meaning that protective suits should be worn. State news agency Tass cited a police officer saying: ""We can't rule out that he drank or took something himself"". Ms Yarmysh dismissed this as ""complete rubbish"".

"Tenants can still receive notice of an eviction Ministers have extended the ban on landlords evicting tenants in England and Wales until 20 September, following fears thousands could lose their homes. In most cases, until the end of March, renters will also get six months' notice if their landlord plans to evict them. Courts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest announcement just gave ""renters a few more weeks to pack their bags"". Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""supporting renters over winter"" amid the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak adding that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first. One landlords' group described the blanket extension as ""unacceptable"". Before the pandemic, notice of eviction was usually two months. In Wales, that had already been extended to six until the end of September and remains under review. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, and laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. A survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. What are the rules around evictions? Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive, said: ""It is right for the government not to lift the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. ""The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters."" This video can not be played Robert Jenrick said cases would be prioritised when they returned to court Health bodies had warned that homelessness or moves that resulted in people living in overcrowded accommodation could risk higher numbers of Covid-19 infections. Politicians have now called for more than the latest extension to the ban. Labour's leader, Sir Keir, said ""Such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags."" Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland Coronavirus in Wales: Tenants to get six months' notice for evictions He described the move as an ""11th-hour u-turn"" and said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""stuck his head in the sand"" for months, adding: ""The ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home as a result of coronavirus."" The former Conservative Communities Secretary, Lord Pickles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the ban should be extended into next spring. He said ""periodic"" extensions were ""pointless"" without further legislative action to give tenants more security. In a letter to judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton said that, having expected the end of the ban on Sunday, the proposal had been of ""an extremely unusual nature and timing"" but would allow further work to be done to prepare for the ban to be lifted. Lawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline. This announcement satisfies no-one. ""Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, anti-social behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates. ""Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure."" This announcement lifts the immediate threat of eviction. Ministers also hope the new six month notice period will prevent a raft of evictions in the winter month. The move has been welcomed - but some are warning it is a sticking plaster and ministers need to use the time to come up with solutions. Some are suggesting a fund to help those who have fallen into rent arrears. But on the other side of the debate, the National Residential Landlords Association is worried, saying landlords had been left powerless in dealing with non-payment of rent. In Wales, tenants who have fallen into arrears are being aided with a saving scheme. Landlord groups have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. David Batchelder, 35, was laid off from his job in pest control at the start of lockdown and is typical of tenants struggling with their finances owing to the economic fall-out of the pandemic. He lives in a flat in High Wycombe with his partner, who works as a building company receptionist, and at the moment is a stay-at-home dad to one-year-old daughter Miley. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" The fall in income and reliance on benefits means he is worried about the future. ""In all honesty, [benefits] are not enough and just do not cover everything,"" he said. ""In difficult times there is a possibility that we could end up losing our home. We would like to know that we've got somewhere secure. ""The landlords have been very good so far, but they can only do so much. And if there was another coronavirus wave, it will be very worrying as to what might happen."" Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"Evo Morales now lives in exile in Argentina after a disputed election last year The Bolivian justice ministry has filed a criminal complaint against former President Evo Morales for statutory rape and human trafficking. It comes after photographs were published in national media of the 60-year-old ex-leader with a young woman who was reportedly a minor at the time. He has not commented on the allegations. Mr Morales was president from 2006-2019 and lives in exile in Argentina after a disputed election in November. The leftist leader stepped down followinglarge protests contesting last year's election results, and a right-wing interim government took charge. While in exile, Mr Morales has been accused ofa range of offences. An alleged relationship between Mr Morales and a 19-year-old woman identified only as N.M began when she was a minor. Evo Morales's turbulent presidency Bolivia's democracy shaky as interim leader steps in Bolivia: Everything you need to know Deputy Minister Guido Melgar told a press conference on Thursday that photos taken from a mobile phone belonging to one of the woman's relatives show her while on trips with Mr Morales. ""The curious thing here is that she was a minor at the time and as we all know, for a minor to travel, she needed her parents' permission,"" he said. She was 14 when she allegedly began to accompany the president on trips, reports Spanish news agency EFE. The role of the young woman's family in allegedly ""allowing"" Mr Morales to travel with her as a minor is also being investigated, Mr Melgar said. Mr Melgar said the government does not know where N.M is, but have evidence that her family visited Argentina, where Mr Morales is living. Under Bolivian law, the crime of rape is punishable with between two and six years in prison, and human trafficking with 15 years. He was one of Latin America's longest serving leaders with almost 14 years as president of Bolivia. Born in a rural village in the western Oruro region into a family from the Aymara group, he became the country's first indigenous leader. Indigenous peoples make up around two-thirds of the population. Mr Morales was Bolivia's first indigenous leader He was part of the ""pink tide"" of left-wing leaders in Latin America that promised wealth distribution and more power for historically oppressed groups. Since he came to office, extreme poverty dropped from 38% in 2006 to 17% in 2018, but critics said levels rose again in his final two years in office. After a controversial decision by the constitutional court to scrap presidential term limits, Mr Morales ran for a fourth consecutive term in office in October 2019. The election result was disputed, and Mr Morales' main rival, Carlos Mesa, cried foul - leading to weeks of unrest across Bolivia.

"Gyms have to ensure social distancing and not all members feel ready to return indoors to exercise Some public pools and sports centres could be at risk of closing without more government money, according to a group representing leisure trusts. Community Leisure UK said 15 cultural and leisure facilities were at risk. Leisure trusts - usually not-for-profit bodies - run services in 11 out of Wales' 22 council areas. The Welsh Government said it had given extra money but the Welsh Local Government Association said long-term funding was needed. Not-for-profit Better Cardiff has recently reopened six of its eight leisure centres. Head of service Rhys Jones, said he hoped it would manage the next 12 months, but there were no guarantees after the trust lost a quarter of its members during lockdown. ""When the government instructed us to close on 20 March we lost all our income overnight, so more than Â£2.5m of income,"" he said. Public pools are popular but expensive to run He urged the Welsh Government to provide financial support for the sector, adding any inaction was ""threatening people's health and physical and mental well-being"". ""We are part of the answer to this virus, this is a public health crisis, everyone knows being physically active boosts your immune system and is a good defence against the virus,"" he said. Mr Jones added he recognised the need to be safe but the policy of only allowing 30 people in one room regardless of its size was ""holding things back a little bit"". Gyms, pools and play centres in Wales reopen Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Students' stories of working on NHS coronavirus front line Community Leisure UK said its latest research showed 44% of trusts in Wales would be ""non-viable or insecure"" by the end of this financial year with ""15 facilities across leisure and culture are at risk of permanent closure"". The body said there was a ""critical need for ring-fenced government financial support"" and it had been difficult for trusts to access other UK government help such as loan schemes or grant funding. Alyson Smith says her local leisure centre is a ""fantastic resource"" Alyson Smith, from Cardiff, described her local leisure centre as ""her rock"" in the last two years after her partner died suddenly. The fitness enthusiast said she was worried about funding and wants to see investment in a healthy population. She helped to create a ""Stay Strong"" programme alongside staff at Eastern Leisure Centre in Llanrumney. The course offers fitness classes and workshops or relaxation techniques to help people deal with issues like anxiety. With the programme paused under lockdown, she said the last few months had been ""awful"". ""I became quite depressed towards the end of lockdown because at one point I had not seen another human being for three months"". ""We can't all afford to go to expensive gyms or spend thousands of pounds on home exercise equipment. ""This offers something at the centre of community that's reasonably priced and it's a fantastic resource,"" she added. Leisure centres will not be able to operate as they once did Huw Thomas, Welsh Local Government Association spokesman for tourism and leisure, said long-term funding was needed. Leisure centres, whether run by councils or trusts, had taken a financial hit during the pandemic, and ""as they start to reopen you know they're not going to be able to reopen to the same level of numbers as existed previously"", he said. A Welsh Government spokesman said it provided support to the sector through its economic resilience fund and through Sport Wales. He said it had recently announced a further Â£260m for councils, ""bringing the total amount of support to half a billion pounds"", to help with additional pandemic costs, which could be used to support leisure facilities.

"The Saundersfoot harbour master says such behaviour ""puts strain"" on the emergency services Men pictured swimming and jumping into the sea during stormy conditions have been labelled ""stupid"" and ""senseless"". Saundersfoot harbour master David Richards said such behaviour puts ""strain"" on the emergency services. On Friday hundreds of homes were left without power in south Wales, seven flood warnings were issued and there was significant disruption to travel. A campsite owner in Pembrokeshire said he had ""never seen anything like this"" in August.

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors say leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny - who supporters believe was poisoned - remains too ill to be moved to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny has been in a coma since Thursday when he fell ill on a flight. His supporters called the doctors' decision ""a direct threat to his life"". The doctors say no poison was found in his body. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. German doctors have now been given access to him in hospital, one of his aides told reporters. At a news conference in Berlin, Leonid Volkov said a medically equipped plane sent from Germany was still waiting for him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he is in hospital. In a preliminary diagnosis on Friday, doctors said his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. The head doctor at the hospital treating Mr Navalny in Omsk in Siberia said the patient was too unstable to be transferred and that legal questions would need to be resolved before any move. Mr Navalny's team said it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital. ""The ban on the transportation of Navalny is an attempt on his life,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the Charite hospital was ready to treat him. It said the aircraft had medical equipment and a team specialised in treating coma patients on board. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. The air ambulance for Mr Navalny arrived in Omsk on Friday morning. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia has written to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday, he said transporting him by air ""may pose a threat to his health"". The hospital said it would not hand Mr Navalny over. Yulia Navalnaya told reporters she believed the doctors were seeking to cover up her husband's poisoning. ""We certainly believe that it is done to make sure that a chemical substance which is in Alexei's body will dissolve,"" she said. ""We certainly cannot trust this hospital"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned. December 2019:Russian security forcesraided the offices of his Anti-Corruption Foundation, taking laptops and other equipment. CCTV footage showed officials using power tools to get through the door. Earlier that year, his organisation was declared a ""foreign agent"". This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 The German government said it was in touch with officials in Moscow to find a solution to the ""humanitarian emergency"". The EU called for Mr Navalny to be ""safely and speedily transferred abroad"" and urged a ""swift, independent, transparent investigation"" into the suspected poisoning. The US Embassy in Russia said that, ""if true"", the suspected poisoning of Mr Navalny ""represents a grave moment for Russia"". Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. ""Alexei has toxic poisoning,"" Ms Yarmysh tweeted. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media showed Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Another photograph on social media purported to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Siberian hospital, said a preliminary diagnosis of a ""metabolic disorder"" had been given. ""This could have been caused by a sharp fall in blood sugar levels, which caused a loss of consciousness,"" he said. The hospital says its tests have found no traces of poison in Mr Navalny's blood so far. Mr Murakhovsky said traces of a common industrial chemical used in plastic cups had been found on Mr Navalny's clothes and fingers. He earlier said there were five possible diagnoses. Deputy head doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said ""poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner"" but that doctors did not believe poisoning was responsible. Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Mr Navalny, said on Friday he had been told by a transport police official that a ""deadly"" substance had been used, which posed a threat not only to the opposition figure's life, but also those around him, meaning that protective suits should be worn. State news agency Tass cited a police officer saying: ""We can't rule out that he drank or took something himself"". Ms Yarmysh dismissed this as ""complete rubbish"".

"Combined with the existing Gwynt y Mor turbines the wind farm would be among the largest in the world Plans to create one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world off the north Wales coast have got a step closer despite fears over the impact on scenery. About 100 turbines could be built as part of plans for Awel y MÃ´r, between Colwyn Bay and Llanfairfechan. Campaigners who fought against the nearby Gwynt y MÃ´r farm said the turbines were ""an eyesore"". RWE Renewables said the wind farm would create ""green clean renewable energy"". Back in 2015,the same developers opened one of the UK's largest offshore wind farms, Gwynt y MÃ´r, which has 160 turbines, off the coast of Llandudno, Conwy. Now they have been granted rights by the Crown Estate for the sea bed between Colwyn Bay and Llanfairfechan. How do you build a turbine? Campaigners 'would fight' more turbines off coast Wales' 100% renewable energy challenge A ""scoping report"" has been submitted to councils in the region, outlining plans to build another 100 turbines, to the west of the current wind farm. This would mean that the two combined would create one of the biggest wind farms in the world. Tamsyn Rowe said the wind farm would help reach Welsh Government renewable energy targets Project Manager Tamsyn Rowe said the project was in its ""early stages"", with the company hoping it could be operational by 2030. ""It's going to be a really great project and it's going to create lots of green, clean renewable energy,"" she said. Ms Rowe said that the wind farm would create up to 100 permanent jobs, and 700 during the construction of the site. John Lawson-Reay said it would be ""criminal"" to ruin the scenery But John Lawson-Reay, who led the Save Our Scenery campaign group against Gwynt y MÃ´r, said the group would fight the plans. ""It started and then it spread and spread. It's become a visual eyesore,"" he said. ""One of the main things we have to sell is the scenery and to clutter it up is criminal.""

Deputy leader of Conwy council, Goronwy Edwards, said the authority welcomed the investment in the area, especially during such a ""worrying time"".

The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine. The Portuguese government welcomed the changes as ""useful for all those who travel between Portugal and the United Kingdom"". It said the move was,external""proof of the good outcome of intense bilateral work"" and ""allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control"".

The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before quarantine measures came into force. It is thought around 20,000 British tourists are currently in Croatia. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Responding to the changes, Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the government had ""now made it clear that countries can be removed or added from the travel corridor list at a moment's notice"". He said the policy made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. But he added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Mr Boland also called on the government to provide ""urgent"" support to the travel industry, adding: ""The addition of Portugal is likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies who are at the point of collapse, as summer trips have already been cancelled.""

Diane Barwick was in the Croatian town of Zadar visiting her daughter - having cancelled a planned trip to France when that country was removed from the exemption list. She told BBC News: ""My daughter should have been married here in May. I've not seen her for nearly a year and have had three flights cancelled this year."" Unlike many other British visitors to Croatia, she had responded to rumours that the country was set to be removed from the exemption list by booking an alternative early flight home. That means she should be able to get home before the deadline and back to her job in retail. ""If you're in France you can get the boat or Eurostar. Here it's a flight only. I've got to travel three hours tomorrow to get to the airport in Croatia,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

BBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's. In July, the Portuguese governmentexpressed ""regret""at the UK's decision to continue to exclude it from the safe travel list.

"Joe Biden sets out his vision for the US presidency, and vows to overturn the Trump legacy he calls a ""season of darkness"" He addressed the final day of the Democratic convention and formally accepted the nomination to run for the White House Biden, 77, will battle Donald Trump in the 3 November US presidential election On Wednesday his running mate, Kamala Harris launched a scathing attack on Trump, condemning his ""failure of leadership"" Trump told supporters Biden would be ""a nightmare"" as president, and said his convention promises were ""just words"" Edited by Matthew Davis We've come to the end of the 2020 Democratic Convention - and our live coverage. Thanks for joining us! Joe Biden's big night went off without a hitch as he gave the most important speech of his political career and then celebrated (while wearing a mask) with fireworks outside. Fun fact: at 24.5 minutes, his speech, according to CSPAN, was the shortest of any Democratic political nominee in over 30 years (Bill Clinton tops the list with a 64.5- minute speech in 1996). Here's a roundup of the night's key points: Up next: we'll do this all over again, but in Republican style, next week. You can follow updates to this storyhere. Want more analysis?Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher's got you covered. Tonight's coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, David Walker, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. Reality Check We have a final fact check from Biden's keynote speech: Describing the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, he said: âMore than
50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.â And heâs right, based
on the total number of Americans who have filed jobless claims since the virus
struck, according to US Labor Department statistics. The number of
people still claiming unemployment benefits is 14.8m, according to the latest
release of weekly figures. It has been declining since May, when there were
more than 20m claims. There were 1.1m
claims in the week ending 15 August - a slight increase compared to the
previous week. The unemployment
rate is still much higher than pre-pandemic levels and currently stands at
10.2%. It's been a back to back week of political fanfare for the Democrats, but we're only halfway through the 2020 convention season. Next week, the Republicans will have their turn to host, and officially make Donald Trump their party nominee. Unlike their Democratic counterparts, the Republicans still plan on hosting some in-person business at their event in Charlotte, North Carolina, though people will reportedly be required to wear masks and social distance. Party members in Charlotte will also don Bluetooth badges that allow for tracking and contact tracing. Those attending will be given a self-swab Covid-19 test before traveling and entering their hotels, and will have their temperatures checked. ""It won't be your typical convention,"" President Trump told Fox News last month. ""But it's going to be be very safe and I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers, crowded into a room."" As of 17 August, Trump has said he'll accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Read more about the 2020 Republican National Convention Let's not overlook the bigger picture. Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year - and as we head into the Republican political convention next week, the numbers don't read well for the sitting president. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a double digit lead on occasions. US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden  Let's pop over to Twitter for some instant reaction, shall we? Some conservatives - like Fox News host Laura Ingraham - have been quick to point out the lack of a clear plan from the Democratic presidential hopeful. Others, like conservative author Rod Dreher felt Biden had a good showing, particularly with demonstrating his empathy. University of Wisconsin, Madison political science professor Barry Burden ruled that the Democrats had pulled off a ""highly effective convention"". But it looks like most on social media can agree, that Brayden Harrington, who spoke about his stutter, was one of the night's highlights. Allow Twitter content?

As the convention wraps up, and we've finally heard from its main star, here's what our voter panel had to say about Joe Biden's big night. Democrat Bilal Aksoy, 21, says: ""I am for Joe because of who he is. I want a president who I can relate to"". Elisa Ruth-Calleiro, a 37-year-old independent, says her Trump-supporting family members are concerned Biden's ""not mentally up to the job"". ""But the speech is good,"" she says. ""He seems fine."" Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Trump supporter Gavin Thompson, 22, says Biden was just offering ""liberal platitudes"" without plans. But, Gavin says ""he doesnât scare me - which worries me, because I think moderates may be drawn to him."" Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande, 57, is also critical of the Biden team's policies. ""Itâs lots of metaphors, sweetness and light, lots of sentimentality. Are we gonna give Medicare for All? No. Are we going to end fossil fuel use? No."" But Urmilla says despite those problems, she's going to vote for Biden ""because Donald Trump terrifies me"". ""The past five years have been really hard. Every day I think about my child in Oklahoma. Is he gonna be OK? Iâve never felt like this before."" Republican strategist Ron Christie, who was an adviser to President George W Bush, tells the BBC how his party may try to exploit perceived Biden weaknesses. ""Coming out of the Democratic convention in Wilmington, Delaware, this
week, Republicans will try to make the case next week that Donald Trump should remain in
office for four more years, when it's their turn to convene in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Republicans will seek to exploit a trifecta - fighting the
pandemic, reviving the economy and dealing with social unrest. Trump will make
the case that he has acted swiftly to ban flights from China while bringing in
a White House 'Dream Team' to fight the pandemic. ""The economy was roaring before
the pandemic struck a blow to the US and the world. I expect to
see Republicans allege Democrats will hinder economic progress with an increase
in taxes. ""Just as Richard Nixon rode the wave of the âSilent Majorityâ
to victory, pledging law and order, expect President Trump to do the same with
the social unrest and rioting across the country. The contrast between
the two candidates will be in stark relief. ""I believe America is watching. This election will be razor tight on 3 November.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Call it
Joe Bidenâs âreturn to normalcyâ speech. That was
Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a
campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World
War I. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and
restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Biden
bills his campaign as a âbattle for the soul of this nationâ, but his message
on Thursday night â the message of many of the Democratic speakers
this week - was not so different from Hardingâs. âItâs time for people to come together,â Biden said. âThis
is not a partisan moment, this must be an American moment.â He spoke
of his campaign being an opportunity to heal, to reform, to unite, to âbe a
path of hope and lightâ. There
was a lot of pressure on Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when
Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or âdiminishedâ. At
least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing speeches in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and
reassuring when needed to be. Biden
gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it wonât
be because of anything that happened Thursday night or at the convention this
entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls
wants.  Closing his speech out, Biden takes a sombre tone, pleading with voters to ""end the chapter of American darkness, here, tonight"". But the seriousness of Biden's message is quickly swapped out for scenes of Democrats across the US, celebrating the nominee. As it's been said, it's an unconventional convention, but that's not stopping the celebration. Americans are shown waving flags and honking their horns - all in a socially distanced formation. Joe Biden and his wife Jill then join Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emoff outside for a fireworks show - a US convention staple - to the tune of Coldplay.   The first reaction from the Trump campaign is coming in. ""By accepting his partyâs nomination tonight, Joe Biden has formally become a pawn of the radical leftists,"" says Trump 2020 communications chief Tim Murtaugh. ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" The Trump campaign argues Biden's policies would raise taxes, give permits to undocumented workers, kill energy jobs and be anti-police in nature. ""Joe Biden is a twice-failed candidate for president and is, without question, a far worse candidate the third time around."" We broke down Trump and Biden's policy platforms to see what both candidates have actually promised. Check out Biden'shere, and Trump'shere. Reality Check Joe Biden criticised President Trumpâs response to the coronavirus
pandemic, saying: âMore than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst
performance of any nation on earth.â The US does have the highest
coronavirus death toll in the world, with 174,248 deaths recorded, according
to Johns Hopkins University. But it has a larger
population than many other countries. If you look at deaths per
capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top
of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst hit countries. The US has recorded more than
52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - according to Johns Hopkins - but there are a handful of countries
that have recorded more, including the UK and Italy. But itâs worth remembering
that there are differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making
exact comparisons difficult. Biden says one of the most important conversations he's had on the campaign trail is speaking with George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, the day before her father's funeral. ""When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and said - I quote - 'Daddy changed the world.'"" Biden says Floyd's murder may have been the breaking point, or perhaps John Lewis' death was the inspiration. ""But however it's come to be, it's happened, America is ready, in John's words, to quote, 'lay down the heavy burden of hate at last'."" He says it's in America's darkest moments that its greatest progress has been made. ""I've always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities."" In perhaps the most pointed contrast with Donald Trump, Biden outlines his foreign policy promises. ""I'll be a president that will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries that the days of cosying up to dictators is over,"" he says. ""Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise: voting."" He returns to a key campaign theme: common values, promising to stand for human rights and dignity, working to achieve a more ""secure, peaceful, and prosperous world"".  Donald Trump has faced a lot of criticism tonight - but he is hitting back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent Above all else, if there
is a Biden Presidency, UK-US relations will snap back to something like
âbusiness as usualâ. In Downing Street and the
Foreign Office, thereâll be no more of the sharply raised eyebrows, expletives
even, which followed each successive Trump denunciation of Americaâs allies.
Those condemnations of democratic leaders were often accompanied by a startling
endorsement of some populist, authoritarian, foreign leader. In stark contrast, Joe
Biden has committed to an immediate return to Americaâs global leadership of
alliances based on shared values and democratic institutions. Britain will
breathe a collective sigh of relief. In particular, candidate
Biden is promising that a President Biden will â â¦ lead the
world to take on the existential threat we faceâclimate changeâ¦ âI will rejoin
the Paris climate agreement on day one of a Biden administration and then
convene a summit of the worldâs major carbon emitters, rallying nations to
raise their ambitions and push progress further and faster.â Thatâs hugely
important to Britain, which will chair the critically important UN Global climate
change talks in Glasgow now postponed to November 2021. If Joe Biden is in the
White House, not Donald Trump, that shifts the entire balance of power towards
active support for more radical action. We could even imagine China and the US
competing with each other in a âvirtueâ contest. There is one
area, however, where Britain may still find it has a mountain to climb in
Washington if Joe Biden occupies the White Houseâtrade. Heâll be no
push over agreeing the terms of a UK-US trade agreement. It was made necessary
by Britainâs decision to leave the EUâsomething Donald Trump hailed as a
triumph-- but which Joe Biden has apparently, like President Obama, always seen
as a colossal mistake. The Democratic nominee now looks at some specifics - reviewing the major policy promises that will animate his campaign. He vows to bring manufacturing jobs to America and ""build back better"". He says he will deliver an education system ""that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century"" and doesn't leave graduates with crippling debt. Biden promises equal pay for women, and says he'll make life better for those keeping the country going through Covid-19. ""We're going to do more than praise our essential workers, we're going to pay them,"" he says. ""I'm not looking to punish anyone, far from it, but it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share."" And he'll protect social security and medicare, he says, ""you have my word"". Biden says Trump has failed in his duty as president with his flawed virus response. He promises that his first action as president, if elected, will be to get Covid-19 under control. ""Because I understand something this president hasn't from the beginning - we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, until we deal with this virus."" He goes on to say: ""After all this time, the president still does not have a plan, Well I do."" Biden says he'll develop and deploy rapid tests with ""results available immediately"". He says he'll make medical supplies and protective gear in the US, ""so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people"". He also promises a national mask mandate. ""We'll take the muzzle off of our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve - the honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it."" ""In short, we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning."" Turning to his former boss, and Donald Trump's predecessor, Biden thanks Barack Obama ""a man I was honoured to serve alongside with for eight years as vice-president"". ""Let me take this time to say something we won't say nearly enough: thank you. You were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to,"" he says. ""No one is going to say that about the current occupant of the White House."" Trump, Biden says, has made the presidency all about himself - ignoring the American people.  A quick look at what our voter panel thinks of the nearly two hours it's taken to get to this point. Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande reacts to this long video introducing Biden: âThis is the problem I have with the Democrats. Itâs always about individuals. Why should it be about individuals? It has to be about policy.â Trump supporter Gavin Thompson tells us: âNone of what is being said right now is about what he [Biden] has done or wants to do. Everything thatâs been said right now â itâs not a vision.â Bilal, a Democrat, adds: âRight now heâs just trying to bring people together. Heâs just trying to unify the party.â The BBC's voter panel watching Biden's speech Biden continues, saying young Americans who've only known rising inequities and shrinking opportunities deserve to know America's promise in full. ""No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we're ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced."" The former vice-president says the country is at ""an inflection point"". ""A time of real peril but also of extraordinary possibilities."" ""Character is on the ballot,"" Biden says. ""Decency, science, democracy - they're all on the ballot."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Evo Morales now lives in exile in Argentina after a disputed election last year The Bolivian justice ministry has filed a criminal complaint against former President Evo Morales for statutory rape and human trafficking. It comes after photographs were published in national media of the 60-year-old ex-leader with a young woman who was reportedly a minor at the time. He has not commented on the allegations. Mr Morales was president from 2006-2019 and lives in exile in Argentina after a disputed election in November. The leftist leader stepped down followinglarge protests contesting last year's election results, and a right-wing interim government took charge. While in exile, Mr Morales has been accused ofa range of offences. An alleged relationship between Mr Morales and a 19-year-old woman identified only as N.M began when she was a minor. Evo Morales's turbulent presidency Bolivia's democracy shaky as interim leader steps in Bolivia: Everything you need to know Deputy Minister Guido Melgar told a press conference on Thursday that photos taken from a mobile phone belonging to one of the woman's relatives show her while on trips with Mr Morales. ""The curious thing here is that she was a minor at the time and as we all know, for a minor to travel, she needed her parents' permission,"" he said. She was 14 when she allegedly began to accompany the president on trips, reports Spanish news agency EFE. The role of the young woman's family in allegedly ""allowing"" Mr Morales to travel with her as a minor is also being investigated, Mr Melgar said. Mr Melgar said the government does not know where N.M is, but have evidence that her family visited Argentina, where Mr Morales is living. Under Bolivian law, the crime of rape is punishable with between two and six years in prison, and human trafficking with 15 years. He was one of Latin America's longest serving leaders with almost 14 years as president of Bolivia. Born in a rural village in the western Oruro region into a family from the Aymara group, he became the country's first indigenous leader. Indigenous peoples make up around two-thirds of the population. Mr Morales was Bolivia's first indigenous leader He was part of the ""pink tide"" of left-wing leaders in Latin America that promised wealth distribution and more power for historically oppressed groups. Since he came to office, extreme poverty dropped from 38% in 2006 to 17% in 2018, but critics said levels rose again in his final two years in office. After a controversial decision by the constitutional court to scrap presidential term limits, Mr Morales ran for a fourth consecutive term in office in October 2019. The election result was disputed, and Mr Morales' main rival, Carlos Mesa, cried foul - leading to weeks of unrest across Bolivia.

"My early take on Joe Biden was that the weaknesses that made it harder for him to secure the Democratic presidential nomination would ultimately make it easier for him to win the presidency. At a time when the Democratic Party was lurching leftwards, his pragmatic centrism would be advantageous because hard-hat voters in the Rust Belt and Starbucks moms in the swing state suburbs would find it unthreatening. Nor was his inability to rouse a crowd necessarily a drawback. Many Americans, after all, were yearning for a presidency they could have on in the background: soothing soft jazz after the round-the-clock heavy metal of the Trump years. Biden's geniality was the key, his smile almost his philosophy. In a politics often driven by negative partisanship - odium for your opponent more so than fervour for your own party's nominee - Biden would be hard to turn into a hate figure. Certainly, he was nowhere near as polarising as Hillary Clinton, whose negatives helped Trump pull off his unexpected victory in 2016. Then I went to Iowa and New Hampshire and was shocked to see how the 77-year-old could barely hold a tune. Speeches became rambling soliloquies, a reminiscence from his Senate career here, a name drop from his vice-presidential tenure there. Looping and meandering, his train of thought regularly careered off the rails. Anecdotes did not seem to make any political point; and while he spoke in vague generalities about redeeming the soul of America, he never thrashed out what precisely that meant. Still he could flash his mega-wattage grin, but he appeared before us as an ambient presence who struggled to light up a room. The early primaries did not go well In 30 years of covering US politics, he was the most lacklustre front-runner I had seen, worse even than Jeb Bush in 2016. The former Florida governor could at least complete a cogent sentence, even if nobody applauded when it came to an end.  After Biden's fourth place finish in the Iowa caucus and his fifth place showing in New Hampshire, many of us thought the time had come for him to don his trademark Aviator shades and ride off westward into the sunset. Instead, of course, he headed to South Carolina, where the endorsement of the influential black Democratic congressman Jim Clyburn and the support of African Americans produced a Lazarus-like return from the dead. Moderate rivals, such as Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, left the race, coalescing around the establishment candidate deemed to stand the best chance of fending off the insurgent challenge from Bernie Sanders. Faced with the alarming prospect of a one-time socialist emerging as the party's nominee, they smashed the emergency glass in the hope that amiable Joe could put out the firebrand. Who will Biden pick as running mate? Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe' Days later, following his cascade of victories on Super Tuesday, some pundits marvelled at how Biden had triumphed in states where he had not even campaigned. But the opposite may well have been true. Biden might have performed well in places precisely because of his absence. The lesson from Iowa and New Hampshire, after all, was that the more voters saw of him, the less they were likely to vote for him. His stealth candidacy ahead of Super Tuesday helped him wrap up the nomination. The Covid lockdown, then, has been a boon to his candidacy. The months sequestered in the basement of his Delaware residence has provided a useful cloak of invisibility. Social distancing has even helped neutralise an issue that once imperiled his campaign: that he was inappropriately tactile with women, creepily touchy-feely. More importantly, the pandemic has taken the heat out of the ideological battle within the Democratic Party. Biden has reached a unity accord with Bernie Sanders without granting too many concessions to the left; one which stops short of promising universal healthcare and a Green New Deal, and avoids altogether polarising issues such as abolishing ICE (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency), or decriminalising unauthorized border crossings. Biden will doubtless lose some progressive support, especially amongst the young, but his campaign calculates this will be offset by attracting the backing of seniors and retirees, many of them one-time Trump supporters. Not only do the elderly vote at a higher rate than any other age group, they are also the demographic most vulnerable to Covid-19. After the troubled start to his candidacy, it is as if the coronavirus has given Biden a political version of antibodies offering protections from his own underlying conditions. His personal narrative also finds a mournful echo in these sorrowful times. Just after winning election to the Senate in 1972, he suffered the trauma of losing his first wife, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. Then in 2015 he watched his son, Beau, who had survived that car accident, die from a rare form of brain cancer. Biden is naturally empathetic.  It puts him on the same emotional plain as many of the 140,000 families who have recently suffered bereavement as a result of Coronavirus. Biden with first wife Neilia and son Hunter in 1972 So far, Biden's bunker strategy has proved resistant to the Trump campaign's bunker-busting bombs - the claims of senility, the charge he has become a cipher for the radical left, the false claim that defunding the police formed part of rapprochement with Bernie Sanders. Instead, the focus has been on Donald Trump's imploding presidency. Incumbency ordinarily bestows advantages. Since 1980, only one sitting president, George Herbert Walker Bush, has failed to win re-election. Even during the post-war period from 1945 to 1980, when only one President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, successfully completed two full terms, voters ousted just two incumbents - Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Donald Trump, however, has annulled the benefits of occupancy through his mishandling of the pandemic. The week when everything changed for Trump Things US has got wrong - and got right - in pandemic The usual rule of thumb is that incumbency combined with a strong economy almost guarantees re-election - in 1992, Bush senior was primarily a victim of a recessionary economy that failed to rebound by Election Day. But Covid-19, of course, has decimated the economy, causing the most serious economic shock since the Great Depression. Voters who pointed to their soaring 401K retirement plans to rationalise their support for a president whose behaviour they often found distasteful, are shopping around. Many, the polls suggest, have already checked out. Even some of his supposed loyalists, the non-college-educated white voters who comprise his base, are deserting him. Earlier in the year, he enjoyed a 31-point lead among this demographic, but recently that has slipped by 10 points. Polling shows that an unexpectedly high number of white voters disapprove of the president's handling of the racial protests following the alleged murder of George Floyd. They have not responded to Trump's tough law and order stance, which borrowed from Richard Nixon's winning presidential campaign in 1968 that followed a long summer of racial turbulence. Maybe Trump has failed to appreciate a key difference between then and now. In 1968, Nixon was not the president. Biden with son Beau who died in 2015 Elections are often framed as a choice between continuity and change. Yet a selling point for Biden is that he offers voters a version of both. To the eight in 10 Americans who polling suggests believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, he is promising a course correction. Thus, he can plausibly present himself as a candidate of change. But by pledging to serve as a conventional president, returning to the norms of behaviour that Republicans and Democratic incumbents have abided by for decades, he also represents a continuum. The repair of a chain in which Trump became the missing link. Because of the false prophecies of 2016, pundits are understandably reluctant to make predictions, and to call time on a president with a double-digit deficit in most national polls and in some battleground state surveys, too. The caution is well-advised. As Biden ventures out more often from his basement redoubt, he will face closer scrutiny. Campaign reporters will soon tire of re-writing the same Trump-is-in-trouble narrative and could easily try to inject more drama and journalistic entertainment value into the race by seizing on even the slightest slip or stumble. Then there are the vagaries of the Electoral College, which means Donald Trump could win a second term even if he loses the popular vote, as was the case in 2016. Nor can we rule out the possibility of a disputed election being decided in the courts. Certainly, it would be an act of folly to write off Trump, who has walked away from more car crashes than any other sitting president. But over the past four years, the scar tissue has accumulated, and the pandemic has left him with self-inflicted wounds. Besides, even some of the supporters who placed their faith in him are tiring of his tricks of escapology - the boasts, the truth-twisting and the insults. This has become a Covid election. Now it is the president's weaknesses that are making Joe Biden look so strong. Follow Nick on Twitter,external US children explain why they are protesting.

"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who ""built this country"", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances. With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues. Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme. He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend ""whatever it takes"" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his ""Build Back Better"" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce ""Buy American"" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas. His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology. In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his ""build back"" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised ""tough-on-crime"" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty. However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme. Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing ""green energy"" products. Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts. The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China ""can't afford to ignore"", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the ""Dreamers"" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid. In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access. These would be paid using money gained back from withdrawing the Trump-era tax cuts.

"Joe Biden sets out his vision for the US presidency, and vows to overturn the Trump legacy he calls a ""season of darkness"" He addressed the final day of the Democratic convention and formally accepted the nomination to run for the White House Biden, 77, will battle Donald Trump in the 3 November US presidential election On Wednesday his running mate, Kamala Harris launched a scathing attack on Trump, condemning his ""failure of leadership"" Trump told supporters Biden would be ""a nightmare"" as president, and said his convention promises were ""just words"" Edited by Matthew Davis We've come to the end of the 2020 Democratic Convention - and our live coverage. Thanks for joining us! Joe Biden's big night went off without a hitch as he gave the most important speech of his political career and then celebrated (while wearing a mask) with fireworks outside. Fun fact: at 24.5 minutes, his speech, according to CSPAN, was the shortest of any Democratic political nominee in over 30 years (Bill Clinton tops the list with a 64.5- minute speech in 1996). Here's a roundup of the night's key points: Up next: we'll do this all over again, but in Republican style, next week. You can follow updates to this storyhere. Want more analysis?Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher's got you covered. Tonight's coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, David Walker, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. Reality Check We have a final fact check from Biden's keynote speech: Describing the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, he said: âMore than
50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.â And heâs right, based
on the total number of Americans who have filed jobless claims since the virus
struck, according to US Labor Department statistics. The number of
people still claiming unemployment benefits is 14.8m, according to the latest
release of weekly figures. It has been declining since May, when there were
more than 20m claims. There were 1.1m
claims in the week ending 15 August - a slight increase compared to the
previous week. The unemployment
rate is still much higher than pre-pandemic levels and currently stands at
10.2%. It's been a back to back week of political fanfare for the Democrats, but we're only halfway through the 2020 convention season. Next week, the Republicans will have their turn to host, and officially make Donald Trump their party nominee. Unlike their Democratic counterparts, the Republicans still plan on hosting some in-person business at their event in Charlotte, North Carolina, though people will reportedly be required to wear masks and social distance. Party members in Charlotte will also don Bluetooth badges that allow for tracking and contact tracing. Those attending will be given a self-swab Covid-19 test before traveling and entering their hotels, and will have their temperatures checked. ""It won't be your typical convention,"" President Trump told Fox News last month. ""But it's going to be be very safe and I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers, crowded into a room."" As of 17 August, Trump has said he'll accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Read more about the 2020 Republican National Convention Let's not overlook the bigger picture. Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year - and as we head into the Republican political convention next week, the numbers don't read well for the sitting president. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a double digit lead on occasions. US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden  Let's pop over to Twitter for some instant reaction, shall we? Some conservatives - like Fox News host Laura Ingraham - have been quick to point out the lack of a clear plan from the Democratic presidential hopeful. Others, like conservative author Rod Dreher felt Biden had a good showing, particularly with demonstrating his empathy. University of Wisconsin, Madison political science professor Barry Burden ruled that the Democrats had pulled off a ""highly effective convention"". But it looks like most on social media can agree, that Brayden Harrington, who spoke about his stutter, was one of the night's highlights. Allow Twitter content?

As the convention wraps up, and we've finally heard from its main star, here's what our voter panel had to say about Joe Biden's big night. Democrat Bilal Aksoy, 21, says: ""I am for Joe because of who he is. I want a president who I can relate to"". Elisa Ruth-Calleiro, a 37-year-old independent, says her Trump-supporting family members are concerned Biden's ""not mentally up to the job"". ""But the speech is good,"" she says. ""He seems fine."" Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Trump supporter Gavin Thompson, 22, says Biden was just offering ""liberal platitudes"" without plans. But, Gavin says ""he doesnât scare me - which worries me, because I think moderates may be drawn to him."" Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande, 57, is also critical of the Biden team's policies. ""Itâs lots of metaphors, sweetness and light, lots of sentimentality. Are we gonna give Medicare for All? No. Are we going to end fossil fuel use? No."" But Urmilla says despite those problems, she's going to vote for Biden ""because Donald Trump terrifies me"". ""The past five years have been really hard. Every day I think about my child in Oklahoma. Is he gonna be OK? Iâve never felt like this before."" Republican strategist Ron Christie, who was an adviser to President George W Bush, tells the BBC how his party may try to exploit perceived Biden weaknesses. ""Coming out of the Democratic convention in Wilmington, Delaware, this
week, Republicans will try to make the case next week that Donald Trump should remain in
office for four more years, when it's their turn to convene in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Republicans will seek to exploit a trifecta - fighting the
pandemic, reviving the economy and dealing with social unrest. Trump will make
the case that he has acted swiftly to ban flights from China while bringing in
a White House 'Dream Team' to fight the pandemic. ""The economy was roaring before
the pandemic struck a blow to the US and the world. I expect to
see Republicans allege Democrats will hinder economic progress with an increase
in taxes. ""Just as Richard Nixon rode the wave of the âSilent Majorityâ
to victory, pledging law and order, expect President Trump to do the same with
the social unrest and rioting across the country. The contrast between
the two candidates will be in stark relief. ""I believe America is watching. This election will be razor tight on 3 November.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Call it
Joe Bidenâs âreturn to normalcyâ speech. That was
Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a
campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World
War I. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and
restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Biden
bills his campaign as a âbattle for the soul of this nationâ, but his message
on Thursday night â the message of many of the Democratic speakers
this week - was not so different from Hardingâs. âItâs time for people to come together,â Biden said. âThis
is not a partisan moment, this must be an American moment.â He spoke
of his campaign being an opportunity to heal, to reform, to unite, to âbe a
path of hope and lightâ. There
was a lot of pressure on Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when
Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or âdiminishedâ. At
least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing speeches in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and
reassuring when needed to be. Biden
gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it wonât
be because of anything that happened Thursday night or at the convention this
entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls
wants.  Closing his speech out, Biden takes a sombre tone, pleading with voters to ""end the chapter of American darkness, here, tonight"". But the seriousness of Biden's message is quickly swapped out for scenes of Democrats across the US, celebrating the nominee. As it's been said, it's an unconventional convention, but that's not stopping the celebration. Americans are shown waving flags and honking their horns - all in a socially distanced formation. Joe Biden and his wife Jill then join Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emoff outside for a fireworks show - a US convention staple - to the tune of Coldplay.   The first reaction from the Trump campaign is coming in. ""By accepting his partyâs nomination tonight, Joe Biden has formally become a pawn of the radical leftists,"" says Trump 2020 communications chief Tim Murtaugh. ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" The Trump campaign argues Biden's policies would raise taxes, give permits to undocumented workers, kill energy jobs and be anti-police in nature. ""Joe Biden is a twice-failed candidate for president and is, without question, a far worse candidate the third time around."" We broke down Trump and Biden's policy platforms to see what both candidates have actually promised. Check out Biden'shere, and Trump'shere. Reality Check Joe Biden criticised President Trumpâs response to the coronavirus
pandemic, saying: âMore than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst
performance of any nation on earth.â The US does have the highest
coronavirus death toll in the world, with 174,248 deaths recorded, according
to Johns Hopkins University. But it has a larger
population than many other countries. If you look at deaths per
capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top
of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst hit countries. The US has recorded more than
52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - according to Johns Hopkins - but there are a handful of countries
that have recorded more, including the UK and Italy. But itâs worth remembering
that there are differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making
exact comparisons difficult. Biden says one of the most important conversations he's had on the campaign trail is speaking with George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, the day before her father's funeral. ""When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and said - I quote - 'Daddy changed the world.'"" Biden says Floyd's murder may have been the breaking point, or perhaps John Lewis' death was the inspiration. ""But however it's come to be, it's happened, America is ready, in John's words, to quote, 'lay down the heavy burden of hate at last'."" He says it's in America's darkest moments that its greatest progress has been made. ""I've always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities."" In perhaps the most pointed contrast with Donald Trump, Biden outlines his foreign policy promises. ""I'll be a president that will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries that the days of cosying up to dictators is over,"" he says. ""Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise: voting."" He returns to a key campaign theme: common values, promising to stand for human rights and dignity, working to achieve a more ""secure, peaceful, and prosperous world"".  Donald Trump has faced a lot of criticism tonight - but he is hitting back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent Above all else, if there
is a Biden Presidency, UK-US relations will snap back to something like
âbusiness as usualâ. In Downing Street and the
Foreign Office, thereâll be no more of the sharply raised eyebrows, expletives
even, which followed each successive Trump denunciation of Americaâs allies.
Those condemnations of democratic leaders were often accompanied by a startling
endorsement of some populist, authoritarian, foreign leader. In stark contrast, Joe
Biden has committed to an immediate return to Americaâs global leadership of
alliances based on shared values and democratic institutions. Britain will
breathe a collective sigh of relief. In particular, candidate
Biden is promising that a President Biden will â â¦ lead the
world to take on the existential threat we faceâclimate changeâ¦ âI will rejoin
the Paris climate agreement on day one of a Biden administration and then
convene a summit of the worldâs major carbon emitters, rallying nations to
raise their ambitions and push progress further and faster.â Thatâs hugely
important to Britain, which will chair the critically important UN Global climate
change talks in Glasgow now postponed to November 2021. If Joe Biden is in the
White House, not Donald Trump, that shifts the entire balance of power towards
active support for more radical action. We could even imagine China and the US
competing with each other in a âvirtueâ contest. There is one
area, however, where Britain may still find it has a mountain to climb in
Washington if Joe Biden occupies the White Houseâtrade. Heâll be no
push over agreeing the terms of a UK-US trade agreement. It was made necessary
by Britainâs decision to leave the EUâsomething Donald Trump hailed as a
triumph-- but which Joe Biden has apparently, like President Obama, always seen
as a colossal mistake. The Democratic nominee now looks at some specifics - reviewing the major policy promises that will animate his campaign. He vows to bring manufacturing jobs to America and ""build back better"". He says he will deliver an education system ""that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century"" and doesn't leave graduates with crippling debt. Biden promises equal pay for women, and says he'll make life better for those keeping the country going through Covid-19. ""We're going to do more than praise our essential workers, we're going to pay them,"" he says. ""I'm not looking to punish anyone, far from it, but it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share."" And he'll protect social security and medicare, he says, ""you have my word"". Biden says Trump has failed in his duty as president with his flawed virus response. He promises that his first action as president, if elected, will be to get Covid-19 under control. ""Because I understand something this president hasn't from the beginning - we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, until we deal with this virus."" He goes on to say: ""After all this time, the president still does not have a plan, Well I do."" Biden says he'll develop and deploy rapid tests with ""results available immediately"". He says he'll make medical supplies and protective gear in the US, ""so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people"". He also promises a national mask mandate. ""We'll take the muzzle off of our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve - the honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it."" ""In short, we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning."" Turning to his former boss, and Donald Trump's predecessor, Biden thanks Barack Obama ""a man I was honoured to serve alongside with for eight years as vice-president"". ""Let me take this time to say something we won't say nearly enough: thank you. You were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to,"" he says. ""No one is going to say that about the current occupant of the White House."" Trump, Biden says, has made the presidency all about himself - ignoring the American people.  A quick look at what our voter panel thinks of the nearly two hours it's taken to get to this point. Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande reacts to this long video introducing Biden: âThis is the problem I have with the Democrats. Itâs always about individuals. Why should it be about individuals? It has to be about policy.â Trump supporter Gavin Thompson tells us: âNone of what is being said right now is about what he [Biden] has done or wants to do. Everything thatâs been said right now â itâs not a vision.â Bilal, a Democrat, adds: âRight now heâs just trying to bring people together. Heâs just trying to unify the party.â The BBC's voter panel watching Biden's speech Biden continues, saying young Americans who've only known rising inequities and shrinking opportunities deserve to know America's promise in full. ""No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we're ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced."" The former vice-president says the country is at ""an inflection point"". ""A time of real peril but also of extraordinary possibilities."" ""Character is on the ballot,"" Biden says. ""Decency, science, democracy - they're all on the ballot."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Scientists carried out measurements in the lab Singing does not produce substantially more respiratory particles than speaking at a similar volume, a study suggests. But it all depends on how loud a person is, according to the initial findings which are yet to be peer reviewed. The project, called Perform, looked at the amount of aerosols and droplets generated by performers. The findings could have implications for live indoor performances, which resumed in England this week. They are currently only allowed to take place under strict social distancing guidelines. Aerosols are tiny particles which are exhaled from the body and float in the air. There is emerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread through these particles, as well in droplets which fall onto surfaces and are then touched. Twenty-five professional performers of different genders, ethnicities, ages and backgrounds - musical theatre, opera, gospel, jazz and pop - took part in the study that was led by scientists at the University of Bristol. Is it safe to sing yet? How a church sings when the choir can't meet The strange case of the choir that coughed in January They individually completed a range of exercises, which included singing and speaking Happy Birthday at different pitches and volumes, in an operating theatre where there were no other aerosols present. This allowed researchers to analyse the aerosols produced by specific sounds. They found that the volume of the voice had the largest impact on the amount of aerosol produced. For example, there was some difference - albeit not very substantial - between speaking and singing at a similar level. Whereas singing or shouting at the loudest level could generate 30 times more aerosol. The impact of playing instruments was also tested Ventilation could also have an effect on how aerosol builds up. The larger the venue and the more ventilation there is could affect how concentrated the volumes are. Jonathan Reid, professor of physical chemistry at the University of Bristol, is one of the authors of the paper, which was supported by Public Health England. He said: ""Our research has provided a rigorous scientific basis for Covid-19 recommendations for arts venues to operate safely, for both the performers and audience, by ensuring that spaces are appropriately ventilated to reduce the risk of airborne transmission."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""I know singing is an important passion and pastime for many people, who I'm sure will join me in welcoming the findings of this important study. ""We have worked closely with medical experts throughout this crisis to develop our understanding of Covid-19, and we have now updated our guidance in light of these findings so people can get back to performing together safely."" Dr Rupert Beale of the Francis Crick Institute, said: ""This important research suggests there is no specific excess risk of transmission due to singing. Loud speech and singing both carry excess risk however. This research supports the possibility of safe performance as long as there's appropriate social distancing and ventilation."" Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said: ""The risk is amplified when a group of singers are singing together, eg singing to an audience, whether in churches or concert halls or theatres.  It is a nice study but not exactly representative of the real whole choir dynamic, which really needs further study to truly assess the risk of such large volume synchronised singing vocalisations/exhalations. ""The risks should not be overly underestimated or played down because of this - we don't want choir members getting infected and potentially dying from Covid-19 whilst doing what they love.""

" How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who ""built this country"", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances. With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues. Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme. He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend ""whatever it takes"" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his ""Build Back Better"" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce ""Buy American"" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas. His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology. In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his ""build back"" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised ""tough-on-crime"" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty. However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme. Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing ""green energy"" products. Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts. The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China ""can't afford to ignore"", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the ""Dreamers"" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid. In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access. These would be paid using money gained back from withdrawing the Trump-era tax cuts.

"Joe Biden sets out his vision for the US presidency, and vows to overturn the Trump legacy he calls a ""season of darkness"" He addressed the final day of the Democratic convention and formally accepted the nomination to run for the White House Biden, 77, will battle Donald Trump in the 3 November US presidential election On Wednesday his running mate, Kamala Harris launched a scathing attack on Trump, condemning his ""failure of leadership"" Trump told supporters Biden would be ""a nightmare"" as president, and said his convention promises were ""just words"" Edited by Matthew Davis We've come to the end of the 2020 Democratic Convention - and our live coverage. Thanks for joining us! Joe Biden's big night went off without a hitch as he gave the most important speech of his political career and then celebrated (while wearing a mask) with fireworks outside. Fun fact: at 24.5 minutes, his speech, according to CSPAN, was the shortest of any Democratic political nominee in over 30 years (Bill Clinton tops the list with a 64.5- minute speech in 1996). Here's a roundup of the night's key points: Up next: we'll do this all over again, but in Republican style, next week. You can follow updates to this storyhere. Want more analysis?Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher's got you covered. Tonight's coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, David Walker, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. Reality Check We have a final fact check from Biden's keynote speech: Describing the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, he said: âMore than
50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.â And heâs right, based
on the total number of Americans who have filed jobless claims since the virus
struck, according to US Labor Department statistics. The number of
people still claiming unemployment benefits is 14.8m, according to the latest
release of weekly figures. It has been declining since May, when there were
more than 20m claims. There were 1.1m
claims in the week ending 15 August - a slight increase compared to the
previous week. The unemployment
rate is still much higher than pre-pandemic levels and currently stands at
10.2%. It's been a back to back week of political fanfare for the Democrats, but we're only halfway through the 2020 convention season. Next week, the Republicans will have their turn to host, and officially make Donald Trump their party nominee. Unlike their Democratic counterparts, the Republicans still plan on hosting some in-person business at their event in Charlotte, North Carolina, though people will reportedly be required to wear masks and social distance. Party members in Charlotte will also don Bluetooth badges that allow for tracking and contact tracing. Those attending will be given a self-swab Covid-19 test before traveling and entering their hotels, and will have their temperatures checked. ""It won't be your typical convention,"" President Trump told Fox News last month. ""But it's going to be be very safe and I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers, crowded into a room."" As of 17 August, Trump has said he'll accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Read more about the 2020 Republican National Convention Let's not overlook the bigger picture. Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year - and as we head into the Republican political convention next week, the numbers don't read well for the sitting president. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a double digit lead on occasions. US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden  Let's pop over to Twitter for some instant reaction, shall we? Some conservatives - like Fox News host Laura Ingraham - have been quick to point out the lack of a clear plan from the Democratic presidential hopeful. Others, like conservative author Rod Dreher felt Biden had a good showing, particularly with demonstrating his empathy. University of Wisconsin, Madison political science professor Barry Burden ruled that the Democrats had pulled off a ""highly effective convention"". But it looks like most on social media can agree, that Brayden Harrington, who spoke about his stutter, was one of the night's highlights. Allow Twitter content?

As the convention wraps up, and we've finally heard from its main star, here's what our voter panel had to say about Joe Biden's big night. Democrat Bilal Aksoy, 21, says: ""I am for Joe because of who he is. I want a president who I can relate to"". Elisa Ruth-Calleiro, a 37-year-old independent, says her Trump-supporting family members are concerned Biden's ""not mentally up to the job"". ""But the speech is good,"" she says. ""He seems fine."" Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Trump supporter Gavin Thompson, 22, says Biden was just offering ""liberal platitudes"" without plans. But, Gavin says ""he doesnât scare me - which worries me, because I think moderates may be drawn to him."" Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande, 57, is also critical of the Biden team's policies. ""Itâs lots of metaphors, sweetness and light, lots of sentimentality. Are we gonna give Medicare for All? No. Are we going to end fossil fuel use? No."" But Urmilla says despite those problems, she's going to vote for Biden ""because Donald Trump terrifies me"". ""The past five years have been really hard. Every day I think about my child in Oklahoma. Is he gonna be OK? Iâve never felt like this before."" Republican strategist Ron Christie, who was an adviser to President George W Bush, tells the BBC how his party may try to exploit perceived Biden weaknesses. ""Coming out of the Democratic convention in Wilmington, Delaware, this
week, Republicans will try to make the case next week that Donald Trump should remain in
office for four more years, when it's their turn to convene in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Republicans will seek to exploit a trifecta - fighting the
pandemic, reviving the economy and dealing with social unrest. Trump will make
the case that he has acted swiftly to ban flights from China while bringing in
a White House 'Dream Team' to fight the pandemic. ""The economy was roaring before
the pandemic struck a blow to the US and the world. I expect to
see Republicans allege Democrats will hinder economic progress with an increase
in taxes. ""Just as Richard Nixon rode the wave of the âSilent Majorityâ
to victory, pledging law and order, expect President Trump to do the same with
the social unrest and rioting across the country. The contrast between
the two candidates will be in stark relief. ""I believe America is watching. This election will be razor tight on 3 November.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Call it
Joe Bidenâs âreturn to normalcyâ speech. That was
Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a
campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World
War I. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and
restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Biden
bills his campaign as a âbattle for the soul of this nationâ, but his message
on Thursday night â the message of many of the Democratic speakers
this week - was not so different from Hardingâs. âItâs time for people to come together,â Biden said. âThis
is not a partisan moment, this must be an American moment.â He spoke
of his campaign being an opportunity to heal, to reform, to unite, to âbe a
path of hope and lightâ. There
was a lot of pressure on Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when
Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or âdiminishedâ. At
least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing speeches in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and
reassuring when needed to be. Biden
gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it wonât
be because of anything that happened Thursday night or at the convention this
entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls
wants.  Closing his speech out, Biden takes a sombre tone, pleading with voters to ""end the chapter of American darkness, here, tonight"". But the seriousness of Biden's message is quickly swapped out for scenes of Democrats across the US, celebrating the nominee. As it's been said, it's an unconventional convention, but that's not stopping the celebration. Americans are shown waving flags and honking their horns - all in a socially distanced formation. Joe Biden and his wife Jill then join Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emoff outside for a fireworks show - a US convention staple - to the tune of Coldplay.   The first reaction from the Trump campaign is coming in. ""By accepting his partyâs nomination tonight, Joe Biden has formally become a pawn of the radical leftists,"" says Trump 2020 communications chief Tim Murtaugh. ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" The Trump campaign argues Biden's policies would raise taxes, give permits to undocumented workers, kill energy jobs and be anti-police in nature. ""Joe Biden is a twice-failed candidate for president and is, without question, a far worse candidate the third time around."" We broke down Trump and Biden's policy platforms to see what both candidates have actually promised. Check out Biden'shere, and Trump'shere. Reality Check Joe Biden criticised President Trumpâs response to the coronavirus
pandemic, saying: âMore than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst
performance of any nation on earth.â The US does have the highest
coronavirus death toll in the world, with 174,248 deaths recorded, according
to Johns Hopkins University. But it has a larger
population than many other countries. If you look at deaths per
capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top
of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst hit countries. The US has recorded more than
52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - according to Johns Hopkins - but there are a handful of countries
that have recorded more, including the UK and Italy. But itâs worth remembering
that there are differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making
exact comparisons difficult. Biden says one of the most important conversations he's had on the campaign trail is speaking with George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, the day before her father's funeral. ""When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and said - I quote - 'Daddy changed the world.'"" Biden says Floyd's murder may have been the breaking point, or perhaps John Lewis' death was the inspiration. ""But however it's come to be, it's happened, America is ready, in John's words, to quote, 'lay down the heavy burden of hate at last'."" He says it's in America's darkest moments that its greatest progress has been made. ""I've always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities."" In perhaps the most pointed contrast with Donald Trump, Biden outlines his foreign policy promises. ""I'll be a president that will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries that the days of cosying up to dictators is over,"" he says. ""Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise: voting."" He returns to a key campaign theme: common values, promising to stand for human rights and dignity, working to achieve a more ""secure, peaceful, and prosperous world"".  Donald Trump has faced a lot of criticism tonight - but he is hitting back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent Above all else, if there
is a Biden Presidency, UK-US relations will snap back to something like
âbusiness as usualâ. In Downing Street and the
Foreign Office, thereâll be no more of the sharply raised eyebrows, expletives
even, which followed each successive Trump denunciation of Americaâs allies.
Those condemnations of democratic leaders were often accompanied by a startling
endorsement of some populist, authoritarian, foreign leader. In stark contrast, Joe
Biden has committed to an immediate return to Americaâs global leadership of
alliances based on shared values and democratic institutions. Britain will
breathe a collective sigh of relief. In particular, candidate
Biden is promising that a President Biden will â â¦ lead the
world to take on the existential threat we faceâclimate changeâ¦ âI will rejoin
the Paris climate agreement on day one of a Biden administration and then
convene a summit of the worldâs major carbon emitters, rallying nations to
raise their ambitions and push progress further and faster.â Thatâs hugely
important to Britain, which will chair the critically important UN Global climate
change talks in Glasgow now postponed to November 2021. If Joe Biden is in the
White House, not Donald Trump, that shifts the entire balance of power towards
active support for more radical action. We could even imagine China and the US
competing with each other in a âvirtueâ contest. There is one
area, however, where Britain may still find it has a mountain to climb in
Washington if Joe Biden occupies the White Houseâtrade. Heâll be no
push over agreeing the terms of a UK-US trade agreement. It was made necessary
by Britainâs decision to leave the EUâsomething Donald Trump hailed as a
triumph-- but which Joe Biden has apparently, like President Obama, always seen
as a colossal mistake. The Democratic nominee now looks at some specifics - reviewing the major policy promises that will animate his campaign. He vows to bring manufacturing jobs to America and ""build back better"". He says he will deliver an education system ""that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century"" and doesn't leave graduates with crippling debt. Biden promises equal pay for women, and says he'll make life better for those keeping the country going through Covid-19. ""We're going to do more than praise our essential workers, we're going to pay them,"" he says. ""I'm not looking to punish anyone, far from it, but it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share."" And he'll protect social security and medicare, he says, ""you have my word"". Biden says Trump has failed in his duty as president with his flawed virus response. He promises that his first action as president, if elected, will be to get Covid-19 under control. ""Because I understand something this president hasn't from the beginning - we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, until we deal with this virus."" He goes on to say: ""After all this time, the president still does not have a plan, Well I do."" Biden says he'll develop and deploy rapid tests with ""results available immediately"". He says he'll make medical supplies and protective gear in the US, ""so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people"". He also promises a national mask mandate. ""We'll take the muzzle off of our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve - the honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it."" ""In short, we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning."" Turning to his former boss, and Donald Trump's predecessor, Biden thanks Barack Obama ""a man I was honoured to serve alongside with for eight years as vice-president"". ""Let me take this time to say something we won't say nearly enough: thank you. You were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to,"" he says. ""No one is going to say that about the current occupant of the White House."" Trump, Biden says, has made the presidency all about himself - ignoring the American people.  A quick look at what our voter panel thinks of the nearly two hours it's taken to get to this point. Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande reacts to this long video introducing Biden: âThis is the problem I have with the Democrats. Itâs always about individuals. Why should it be about individuals? It has to be about policy.â Trump supporter Gavin Thompson tells us: âNone of what is being said right now is about what he [Biden] has done or wants to do. Everything thatâs been said right now â itâs not a vision.â Bilal, a Democrat, adds: âRight now heâs just trying to bring people together. Heâs just trying to unify the party.â The BBC's voter panel watching Biden's speech Biden continues, saying young Americans who've only known rising inequities and shrinking opportunities deserve to know America's promise in full. ""No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we're ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced."" The former vice-president says the country is at ""an inflection point"". ""A time of real peril but also of extraordinary possibilities."" ""Character is on the ballot,"" Biden says. ""Decency, science, democracy - they're all on the ballot."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said people will need to self-isolate for 14 days on returning from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. The changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine.

But consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was ""likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies"" and called for support for the travel industry. The latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers madea last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before quarantine measures came into force. It is thought around 20,000 British tourists are currently in Croatia. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Responding to the changes, Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said the government had ""now made it clear that countries can be removed or added from the travel corridor list at a moment's notice"". He said the policy made it ""too risky"" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel. But he added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it ""increasingly difficult to claim a refund"". Who decides which countries I can safely visit? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Mr Boland also called on the government to provide ""urgent"" support to the travel industry, adding: ""The addition of Portugal is likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies who are at the point of collapse, as summer trips have already been cancelled."" The Tucker family, from Cambridge, were at a waterfront cafÃ© on the Croatian island of Solta, off the coast of Split, when they heard they would have to quarantine on their return to the UK. ""We already cancelled a holiday in Barcelona because of quarantine rules,"" said mum Luzita, 50, a childminder. ""We've always wanted to come to Croatia so we looked at the infection rates and they seemed very low."" Luzita and David Tucker are on holiday in Croatia with sons Oliver and Kaffian after cancelling a trip to Barcelona She said it was good the government had acted decisively, but suggested there were other options. ""Why not [carry out] virus testing at the airport when we arrive back in the UK? And surely using public transport to get home could be a risk."" Diane Barwick was in the Croatian town of Zadar visiting her daughter - having cancelled a planned trip to France when that country was removed from the exemption list. She told BBC News: ""My daughter should have been married here in May. I've not seen her for nearly a year and have had three flights cancelled this year."" Unlike many other British visitors to Croatia, she had responded to rumours that the country was set to be removed from the exemption list by booking an alternative early flight home. That means she should be able to get home before the deadline and back to her job in retail. ""If you're in France you can get the boat or Eurostar. Here it's a flight only. I've got to travel three hours tomorrow to get to the airport in Croatia,"" she said. The Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information. In a statement, it urged employers to be ""understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate"". But children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.

People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the fine is Â£480, and up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. BBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday. The UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June. But the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's. In July, the Portuguese governmentexpressed ""regret""at the UK's decision to continue to exclude it from the safe travel list. The country's foreign minister had previously said he hoped an ""air bridge"" between the UK and Portugalcould be secured by the end of June.

"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian doctors say leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny - who supporters believe was poisoned - remains too ill to be moved to Germany for treatment. Mr Navalny has been in a coma since Thursday when he fell ill on a flight. His supporters called the doctors' decision ""a direct threat to his life"". The doctors say no poison was found in his body. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea at an airport cafe in the city of Tomsk as he prepared to fly to Moscow. German doctors have now been given access to him in hospital, one of his aides told reporters. At a news conference in Berlin, Leonid Volkov said a medically equipped plane sent from Germany was still waiting for him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he is in hospital. In a preliminary diagnosis on Friday, doctors said his condition might be the result of a ""metabolic disorder"" caused by low blood sugar. The head doctor at the hospital treating Mr Navalny in Omsk in Siberia said the patient was too unstable to be transferred and that legal questions would need to be resolved before any move. Mr Navalny's team said it was ""deadly"" for him to remain in the hospital. ""The ban on the transportation of Navalny is an attempt on his life,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. The Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation organised an air ambulance to pick up Mr Navalny and bring him back to Berlin, where it said the Charite hospital was ready to treat him. It said the aircraft had medical equipment and a team specialised in treating coma patients on board. Russia's vociferous Putin critic The Cinema for Peace Foundation was founded by activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj. In 2018, it arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. The air ambulance for Mr Navalny arrived in Omsk on Friday morning. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia has written to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". On Friday, he said transporting him by air ""may pose a threat to his health"". The hospital said it would not hand Mr Navalny over. Yulia Navalnaya told reporters she believed the doctors were seeking to cover up her husband's poisoning. ""We certainly believe that it is done to make sure that a chemical substance which is in Alexei's body will dissolve,"" she said. ""We certainly cannot trust this hospital"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned.

The EU called for Mr Navalny to be ""safely and speedily transferred abroad"" and urged a ""swift, independent, transparent investigation"" into the suspected poisoning. The US Embassy in Russia said that, ""if true"", the suspected poisoning of Mr Navalny ""represents a grave moment for Russia"". Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. ""Alexei has toxic poisoning,"" Ms Yarmysh tweeted. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media showed Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist ""screaming in pain"". Another photograph on social media purported to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the Siberian hospital, said a preliminary diagnosis of a ""metabolic disorder"" had been given. ""This could have been caused by a sharp fall in blood sugar levels, which caused a loss of consciousness,"" he said. The hospital says its tests have found no traces of poison in Mr Navalny's blood so far. Mr Murakhovsky said traces of a common industrial chemical used in plastic cups had been found on Mr Navalny's clothes and fingers. He earlier said there were five possible diagnoses. Deputy head doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said ""poisoning as a diagnosis remains on the back burner"" but that doctors did not believe poisoning was responsible. Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Mr Navalny, said on Friday he had been told by a transport police official that a ""deadly"" substance had been used, which posed a threat not only to the opposition figure's life, but also those around him, meaning that protective suits should be worn. State news agency Tass cited a police officer saying: ""We can't rule out that he drank or took something himself"". Ms Yarmysh dismissed this as ""complete rubbish"".

"This video can not be played 'I've applied for more than 2,000 jobs with no success' More than 1,000 people applied for one brewery job as the number of vacancies plummeted in lockdown. Northern Monk Brewing Company in Leeds said applicants for the packing job included people made redundant or on furlough. Data from job website Adzuna showed vacancies are down by 59% compared with last summer, with some areas down 80%. Tony Wilson, of the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), said there were signs of improvement. However he warned firms would still freeze recruitment and cut hours. This means that even people who are not losing their jobs will be looking for extra work and adding to the competition for a smaller number of vacancies. Sophie Lennon said applicants included people made redundant and those on furlough Northern Monk Brewing Company in Leeds had 1,021 applications for one packing vacancy. HR manager Sophie Lennon said: ""When we posted the job within the first day we had a really high number of applicants. We've never seen that before. ""We advertised the job for three weeks and at the end of that time we'd had 1,021 applicants for the job which is way above what we'd usually see."" She said she had spoken to people who had been made redundant but also people on furlough who were not sure if they would be brought back. ""It's definitely a mix of both."" Sarah Smith lost her job in May and has been applying for different roles ever since without success. Sarah Smith has not had an interview but has been applying for lots of different jobs The 25-year-old, from Leeds, previously worked for an online retailer. ""I've never really been unemployed for more than two weeks at a time,"" she said. ""It's been just under 2,000 jobs I've applied for now and I've not had one reply. ""All sorts of work - retail, cleaning, care work, apprenticeships - nothing. ""I've had one automatic response but the majority of the time they say if you haven't heard from us in two weeks, please assume you've been unsuccessful."" The Portsmouth University graduate said she was not being picky. ""These jobs aren't what I'd want to do long term, but when you've got responsibilities and a mortgage you've got to work,"" she said. ""You start taking it a little bit personally. I know how much of a hard worker I am and that makes it harder because I've not even had an interview or a phone call."" What happens when the furlough scheme ends? 'Long, long way to go' for economy Millions for small business 'sitting in council accounts' Laura Homer has been on furlough from her main job and has lost a part time one. The 28-year-old is due to return to her reception post at Yorkshire Dance, a centre in Leeds in September. Laura Homer struggled to find another part time job Her part time job as front of house at Leeds Playhouse was lost because the theatre had to close during the coronavirus pandemic. ""There are jobs in retail, but if we do have another wave and things have to close again, that may put me in the same position,"" Miss Homer said. ""I've been hoping to see jobs that would match my experience and skills, and ideally that could be done from home, but there isn't much out there. ""I get a weekly newsletter with arts jobs and lately there are about three vacancies, whereas before lockdown there would have been a long list."" Just under 1.7 million vacancies were listed across the UK between April and July, with May the worst month in more than two years' worth of data. There were 361,570 vacancies posted that month, while the country was still in full lockdown and this rose to 449,484 in July as some places were able to reopen with social distancing. Jobs in the charity and voluntary sector are down by more than 90%, with the data showing just over 2,000 adverts posted between April and July 2020, compared with more than 25,500 in the same months last year. Mr Wilson, director of the IES, said: ""Vacancies have fallen everywhere. ""It's been noticeable in ex-industrial areas, deprived cities and coastal towns. ""There was a pretty significant improvement between June and July, but it's still a long way below February. ""While there will be a rise in redundancy and unemployment, where employers can they will try to reduce hours instead of losing people altogether. ""People will still be in work, but they will be earning less and working fewer hours."" Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, was optimistic about the increase recorded in July, even though it is still well below last year. ""It's nice to see a small, month-on-month uptick across most sectors and locations,"" he said. ""Let's hope this is the start of the jobs bounce back."" He said there had been a rise in vacancies for logistics and warehouse jobs, which he said was driven by employers like Amazon, Deliveroo and DPD. Between April and June, the number of people in work fell by 220,000, the Office for National Statistics said. What jobs are available post-lockdown? What happens when furlough ends?

"Steve Bannon appeared in court in New York City on Thursday Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been arrested and charged with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which raised $25m (Â£19m),the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said.,external Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses, it alleged. In court, he entered a not guilty plea. Mr Bannon, who has been released on bail, was a key architect of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory. His right-wing anti-immigration ideology fuelled Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign. He was arrested on a 150-foot (45m) yacht called the Lady May in Connecticut by agents from the US Postal Inspection Service, which investigates fraud cases. The yacht is owned byChinese billionaire Guo Wengui, US media report. Mr Bannon is the sixth former senior aide to Donald Trump to face criminal charges - after ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, veteran political operator Roger Stone, ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, ex-deputy campaign manager Rick Gates and ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The downfall of Steve Bannon Charting Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall Bannon: 'Trump's border crackdown is anti-racist' Responding to Mr Bannon's arrest, President Trump said he felt ""very badly"" about it. He also said he had had no involvement with ""We Build the Wall"". ""I said, 'This is for government; this isn't for private people' - and it sounded to me like showboating and I think I let my opinion be very strongly stated at the time,"" he said. The ""We Build the Wall"" campaign pledged to use donations to build segments of the border barrier - whose construction was a key Trump promise during the 2016 election - on private land. This video can not be played Trump: Bannon arrest ""a very sad thing"" But Audrey Strauss, the acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), said Mr Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea had ""defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalising on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction"". Mr Bannon had received more than $1m through a non-profit organisation he controlled, at least some of which he used to cover ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses"", the DoJ said. Meanwhile, Mr Kolfage - founder of ""We Build the Wall"" - covertly took $350,000 for his personal use, the statement said. ""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" Ms Strauss said. SDNY Inspector-in-Charge Philip R Bartlett said the four created ""sham invoices and accounts to launder donations and cover up their crimes, showing no regard for the law or the truth"". The campaign exhorted individuals to ""buy a brick"" ""This case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law, not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist,"" he said. Mr Bannon and the three others launched the scheme in December 2018, the DoJ said, and during the campaign Mr Kolfage said that all of the money donated would go towards construction while Mr Bannon publicly said: ""We're a volunteer organisation."" All four defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Mr Bannon, 66, appeared in federal court via video link hours after his arrest on Thursday. Mr Kolfage and Mr Badolato will appear in separate courts in Florida and Mr Shea will appear in Colorado. Mr Bannon was released on bail of $5m, secured by $1.75m in cash or property. He will not be allowed to travel on private planes or boats or to leave the country pending his criminal trial. The line between legitimate online political fundraising and swindling is sometimes a fine one. Federal prosecutors are now alleging that Steve Bannon, a former top political advisor for Donald Trump, crossed it. Mr Bannon was one of those fringe figures who rode Trump's improbable rise to the presidency to national prominence. His time in actual power at the White House was short-lived, however. Donald Trump reportedly resented news reports painting Mr Bannon as the ""brains"" behind the president - a perception boosted by Mr Bannon's willingness to talk with the press. Since then he mostly has been confined to advocating for the president from the sidelines - and participating in sometimes questionable side projects like this wall foundation. That this indictment comes out of the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutorial office that has handled other high-profile cases involving Trump associates, will stir greater interest in the indictment. The district was itself the source of recent controversy when Attorney General Bill Barr abruptly fired its head, Geoffrey Berman. After criticism, Mr Barr was forced to abandon his choice for a temporary replacement, and Mr Berman's top deputy moved into the job, instead. It was this woman, Audrey Strauss, who announced Mr Bannon's indictment. The former investment banker was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website before serving in the Trump White House as chief strategist. His influence was discernible in key decisions such as the mid-2017 US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. He left the post in August 2017 and returned to Breitbart, but was again forced to step down after criticising Mr Trump's decisions, prompting Mr Trump to say ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind"". Mr Bannon was once one of President Trump's most trusted advisers Mr Bannon has sinceexpressed support for the idea of a right-wing supergroupof populist parties in Europe and his presence at events has become controversial, with the New Yorker magazinedropping him from a festival, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonpulling out of an event co-hosted by the BBCat which he appeared, and a furtherappearance at Oxford University Union that attracted protests. Last year he told the BBC thatthe ""turmoil"" from Brexit was ""only just beginning""and argued that the border wall between the US and Mexicowould help black and Hispanic communities. The wall with Mexico is perhaps Donald Trump's most memorable signature promise from his 2016 election campaign. He said he would build it and Mexico would pay for it. Before Mr Trump took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border. He promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Later, he said it would only cover half of that - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. Trump's border wall - in seven charts Trump might not get his wall. It may not matter Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Work on extending the current barrier began last year. The money has come from previous funding approved by Congress, as well as extra cash Mr Trump has been able to access since he declared a state of emergency in February 2019 amid a spike in the number of migrants entering the US. He has gained access to defence funds, but is still short of the original estimate of up to $12bn which, in turn, is far shorter than much higher estimates of the real cost. The administration's aim was to have 509 miles of it ready by the end of 2020.

"Confirmed cases in France have been accelerating from about 1,000 a day in mid-August France has reported a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases - 4,771 - up a thousand on Wednesday's figure. It is the first time more than 4,000 daily cases have been seen since May. Meanwhile Spain, Germany and Italy have also recorded their highest numbers of cases since late April or May. Many of the new Spanish cases are reportedly among the young, while German cases are said to be driven by a lack of social distancing and travellers returning from abroad. What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave AirBnB bans all house parties worldwide 'Signs of hope' as Africa Covid-19 cases level off The UK - which has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll - registered a further 1,182 cases on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases has been accelerating since mid-August. France has increased its testing capacity and carried out 664,000 tests over the past week, the health ministry said, but the rate of positive cases has also been increasing. It stood at 3.3% for the week between 11-17 August, up from 2.1% previously and more than double the 1.5% rate seen at the end of July. Officials say the virus is now mostly circulating in major cities among the young, who typically do not have serious symptoms, and this is why the number of people being treated in hospital has not changed much. Nevertheless three more cities - St Etienne, Nice and Toulouse - have made wearing a mask mandatory in their city centres. Mask-wearing is already required in busy areas of the capital Paris. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has ruled out any postponement of the new school year, which begins on 1 September, although he conceded there ""could be local exceptions"". Pupils aged 11 and above will be required to wear masks when they are moving around schools in confined spaces and in classrooms when they are face to face and separated by less than a metre (3ft). Spain reported 3,349 new cases on Thursday, with the health ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando SimÃ³n saying that no-one in the country should be in any doubt that ""things are not going well"". ""Although the epidemic is not out of control at a national level, it is [out of control] in certain concrete ways,"" he added, quoted by El PaÃ­s newspaper. ""Things are not going well,"" according to a Spanish health official If cases continue to rise there would be ""many hospitalisations, many people in intensive care and many deaths"", he said. The country has seen 122 deaths over the past week, more than ten times the level seen a month ago. The average age of those confirmed to have the virus was now 39 for men and 37 for women - far lower than at the height of the epidemic in the country, when the average age of those infected was over 60. Mr SimÃ³n appealed to social media influencers for help in containing the epidemic, asking them to emphasise to their followers that young people could end up infecting older members of their families. ""I understand that people want to go partying, but there are ways and ways of doing that,"" he said. ""Those with influence over the population must raise awareness about what needs to be done."" The country reported 1,707 new cases, with much of the rise blamed on returning holidaymakers as well as parties and family gatherings. The Robert-Koch Institute said the highest rates of infection were among those returning from Kosovo, Turkey and Croatia. In the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, more than a third of returnees who tested positive were coming from Kosovo and nearly 20% were coming from Turkey. However, those returning from Spain and Greece made up just 2.5% and 0.5% of positive cases in the state. Travellers returning from Kosovo are offered tests at Berlin's central bus station Germany has now designated two Croatian regions - Sibenik-Knin and Split-Dalmatia - as virus risk regions and warned against travel there. Arrivals in Germany from those areas will face mandatory tests for coronavirus. Tourist Cheyenne Maschkewitz in Split told Reuters she had seen less social distancing than at home. ""We arrived here 10 days ago, it's quite different here than in Germany, like the masks - when you go to shopping they don't take it seriously, I think,"" she said. The UK and neighbouring Slovenia have also added Croatia - which recorded 255 new infections on Thursday - to their quarantine lists. Slovenia says it has recorded dozens of cases among people returning from Croatian party destinations. Quarantine rules lifted for Portugal travel However Croatia's Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic insisted that ""less than 1% of tourists got infected in Croatia"" and said a ban on nightclubs opening beyond midnight would probably be extended Italy has also reported a sharp rise in infections, with 845 new cases in its latest daily count. The number is not as high as some other European countries but it is a rate of infection that has not been seen there since late May. ""We are not in as bad a position as France and Spain, but the current situation is not satisfactory,"" said Professor Massimo Galli, head of infectious diseases at Milan's Sacco hospital. Several countries have warned of holidaymakers returning from Croatia with the virus The highest number of cases were reported in Veneto with 159 cases and Lombardy with 154 in Italy's north, and in Rome's Lazio region with 115. ""The end of confinement has resulted in an excessive feeling of false security,"" Prof Galli added, quoted by La Repubblica newspaper. He also pointed to young people returning from summer holidays, citing the example of nine people with the virus coming back from Croatia. ""I don't want to look like the one blaming young people,"" Prof Galli said, but ""every day we receive reports of this type"".

Mr Bannon was once one of President Trump's most trusted advisers Mr Bannon has sinceexpressed support for the idea of a right-wing supergroupof populist parties in Europe and his presence at events has become controversial, with the New Yorker magazinedropping him from a festival, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonpulling out of an event co-hosted by the BBCat which he appeared, and a furtherappearance at Oxford University Union that attracted protests. Last year he told the BBC thatthe ""turmoil"" from Brexit was ""only just beginning""and argued that the border wall between the US and Mexicowould help black and Hispanic communities. The wall with Mexico is perhaps Donald Trump's most memorable signature promise from his 2016 election campaign. He said he would build it and Mexico would pay for it. Before Mr Trump took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border. He promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Later, he said it would only cover half of that - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. Trump's border wall - in seven charts Trump might not get his wall. It may not matter Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Work on extending the current barrier began last year. The money has come from previous funding approved by Congress, as well as extra cash Mr Trump has been able to access since he declared a state of emergency in February 2019 amid a spike in the number of migrants entering the US. He has gained access to defence funds, but is still short of the original estimate of up to $12bn which, in turn, is far shorter than much higher estimates of the real cost. The administration's aim was to have 509 miles of it ready by the end of 2020.

DeVayne's first stint on RuPaul's Drag Race was aired in 2016, where she impressed the judges with her ingenuity and quick wit. Her lip sync to Dreamgirls' And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going is also considered iconic in Drag Race history. Contestants on the show perform lip syncs when they are at risk of elimination. She finished in fourth place, but was invited to take part in the spin-off show RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, which aired at the beginning of 2018. She finished in eighth place. Drag Race: The most political, troubled season ever? Drag Race star disqualified after catfishing claims Bianca Del Rio 'daunted, excited' for Wembley gig Later in 2018 DeVayne was diagnosed with scleroderma, a condition that attacks the internal organs. She was taken to hospital in July - she told her followers on Instagram it was for kidney failure. She was discharged later that month, but went back to hospital again last week - this time, she said, for pneumonia. ""Keep me in your prayers,"" she said in a video message to her fans.
