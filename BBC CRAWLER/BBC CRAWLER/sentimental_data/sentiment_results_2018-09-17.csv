"PC Keith Palmer was pronounced dead at 15:15 on the day of the attack There were no armed officers at the entrance to parliament for almost an hour before PC Keith Palmer was stabbed, an inquest has heard. PC Palmer was killed by Khalid Masood in New Palace Yard, in last year's Westminster terror attack on 22 March. One firearms officer was at another entrance due to Prime Minister's Questions, the inquest heard. Earlier, Tobias Ellwood MP described how he tried to save PC Palmer until he was ordered to stop giving CPR. Four other people died after Masood drove into them on Westminster Bridge. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Watch: 'Hero' MP's emotional terror attack defiance Westminster attack PC 'unprotected' at gate Dominic Adamson, representing PC Palmer's widow Michelle, told the court that firearms officers were only near Carriage Gates for 14 minutes of the 108 minutes before the attack. PC Lee Ashby, one of the two authorised firearms officers (AFOs) who was on duty in New Palace Yard, had not been near the gate at all before the attack. ""I have responsibility to the Members' Entrance, Carriage Gates and College Green. I can't do all of those areas,"" he said. ""There were certain days, Wednesday being one of them, where, as a result of Prime Minister's Questions, you were actively encouraged to be next to the Members' Entrance partly because of the number of high-level MPs and Cabinet ministers."" CCTV footage showed officers on a roving patrol were last at Carriage Gates at 13:42, nearly an hour before the attack began to unfold at 14:40. The inquest heard how armed officers used to be in fixed posts, but this was changed to roving patrols. PC Ashby said he thought the previous security arrangements had been ""better"". ""For me, what we had prior to sectors was the better option because I believe you should have a fixed point firearms officer at every entry point,"" he said. CCTV footage showed he and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders moving towards to the area where PC Palmer had collapsed after three shots rang out. They came from a plain-clothed protection officer shooting Masood. The two officers faced a misconduct investigation that found they should have been near the gates when they were open, but no formal action was taken against them. Mr Ellwood is a former Army officer and is medically trained Earlier, theinquest heard from Tobias Ellwoodwho tried to save PC Palmer's life. Mr Ellwood - Conservative MP for Bournemouth East and a medically-trained former Army officer - told the court he was in a meeting close by when the attack occurred. He said he heard a crash followed by screams, adding: ""These were not screams of pain... these were screams of shock."" After running through crowds of people and hearing shots fired, Mr Ellwood said he saw a number of police officers crouched near Carriage Gate and PC Palmer and Masood on the floor. The three officers helping PC Palmer told him he was risking his life because of the chance of a secondary attack, but the MP - whose brother died in the Bali attack in 2002 - told the court: ""My brother was killed in a secondary attack... so I was very aware of that. ""I was concerned about what would happen if things were to ratchet up, but my immediate concern was that we had somebody who was clearly badly bleeding and needed assistance."" Mr Ellwood said PC Palmer was unconscious, but that he still had a pulse. But PC Palmer's heart stopped, and Mr Ellwood had to begin chest compressions while someone else gave the officer mouth-to-mouth. ""By this time the whole of Westminster was very silent,"" he said. A medical team arrived by helicopter and moved PC Palmer so they could operate on him in the courtyard. Mr Ellwood had to pause in the witness box, before saying: ""Forgive me, it's sometimes easier to do the helping rather than to talk about it afterwards."" Despite their efforts, the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. Mr Ellwood said: ""I told a doctor present 'you're going to have to order me to stop', and the medic said, 'Sir, you've done your best, but you do need to stop'. ""We both covered the body as best we could, closed the eyes and I said, 'I'm sorry'. ""It was a very strange end to a very traumatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left completely alone with just one other person."" Asked by the lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow, about security in Westminster, Mr Ellwood said there had always been a ""sense of vulnerability"" around the Houses of Parliament and that, at times, there had been less firearms protection at the site than he would have liked. But he did not want it to become ""a tower of protection"", as it would ""change the face of what Parliament is about"". The MP added: ""[With] the level of security we have in place [now], I'm not sure we could do more.""

"Mr Musk (R) alleged that British diver Mr Unsworth (L) had a ""child bride"" A British cave diver is suing tech billionaire Elon Musk for defamation after his repeated claims the diver is a child abuser. Vernon Unsworth helped with the rescue of 12 Thai teenagers from a flooded cave in July. Mr Musk has made several accusations against Mr Unsworth without evidence, including that he was a ""child rapist"". The lawsuit seeks $75,000 (Â£57,000) in compensation and an injunction against Mr Musk to stop further allegations. The filing also says Mr Unsworth is seeking ""punitive damages"" as well as the compensation, ""to punish him for his wrongdoing and deter him from repeating such heinous conduct"". It says Mr Musk sometimes used his Twitter account and emails to ""publish to the world false and defamatory accusations"" against the Briton. His account had over 22.5 million followers during this time, the filing states. The South African-born head of Tesla previously tweeted it was ""strange he hasn't sued me"" when Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action. Allow Twitter content?

A separate suit will follow in London, the filing says. ""Musk's influence and wealth cannot convert his lies into truth or protect him from accountability for his wrongdoing in a court of law,"" Mr Unsworth's US attorney, L Lin Wood, said. by Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent The first amendment of the United States Constitution which protects free speech makes defamation a challenging legal action to bring. A plaintiff (the person bringing the case) has to prove the statement made about them is false and that it has caused them material harm. However, the toughest hurdle is that if the person bringing the case is regarded as a public figure - and 'public figure' is given a pretty wide interpretation - it has to be proved that the defendant acted maliciously. In other words that the person making the statement knew it to be false and went on to make it. Another way of putting it would be that it must be proved that the defendant knowingly lied with the intention of harming the plaintiff. The pair first clashed over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help with the cave rescue. The entrepreneur postedfootage of the vehicle on Twitter,externaland suggested it could be used to help save the trapped teens. Allow Twitter content?

The full story of Thailandâs extraordinary cave rescue In pictures: Thai artists' huge mural of cave rescue heroes The Tesla founder responded with a series of tweets accusing Mr Unsworth of paedophilia. Although he later deleted the tweets and offered an apology to the diver,Mr Musk reignited the row earlier this month. An email to Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac,externalincluded the claim the Briton was a ""child rapist"", imploring the reporter to ""find out what's actually going on"" and suggesting the diver took no part in the cave rescue. The billionaire also said he hoped Mr Unsworth would sue him. Mr Unsworth, in orange, provided information for the rescue Mr Unsworth did not take part in the dives but had previously explored the cave complex extensively. He knew about the raised ledge known as Pattaya Beach where the boys and their football coach could have sought shelter, travelled into the caves shortly after they went missing and called in the two expert British divers who eventually found the trapped group. Several divers told Buzzfeed that he had worked continuously on the rescue. ""He was pivotal to the entire operation,"" said British diver Rick Stanton.

"Aisha Jabin, a control room operator for the North West Fire Control, took calls from Grenfell when the fire brigade's London base was overwhelmed A control room operator has told the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry the voice of one victim kept ""going round and round"" in her head after she finished work on 14 June last year. Aisha Jabin spoke to a woman called Debbie, believed to be victim Deborah Lamprell, 45, whose body was found in a 23rd floor flat with six others. Ms Jabin said she froze when she heard the sound of a baby crying in the flat. Another operator did not tell people to stay in their flats, the inquiry heard. Angie Gotts said she was reluctant to advise residents to stay in a burning building since the Lakanal House fire in 2009 in south London, where six people were killed. In a written statement, Ms Jabin described speaking to the resident of the 16th floor, who had sought shelter on the highest floor, and was ""immediately screaming down the phone that she could not get out"". Ms Lamprell said she was among 11 residents, including children, barricaded in the top-floor flat. ""She told me that they had barricaded themselves in as much as they could but she was completely distraught,"" the statement said. ""She told me that there was not much smoke in the flat but that it was starting to get hot. ""I told her the usual guidance - get down low and as they had already barricaded themselves in I just tried to reassure her as much as I could."" At this point, the so-called stay-put policy was still in place for residents. But Ms Jabin said her ""heart sank"" when she realised firefighters were carrying out rescues on the third floor - 20 levels below Ms Lamprell and her neighbours. When the call operator heard the ""loud crack"" of the flat's windows shattering, her advice changed. ""I did tell her to get out of the flat immediately,"" she told the inquiry. ""Unfortunately she couldn't."" What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? Ms Jabin said she ""froze"" when she realised children were amongst those trapped. ""I am a mother and the thought of children being trapped and not able to breathe really affected me,"" the statement said. Ms Lamprell's condition deteriorated and the transcript of the call shows her telling the operator: ""I can't do this any more... It's too hot, it's too smoky."" ""The call went from being really manic at the start and throughout most of it and then really, really quiet,"" Ms Jabin said in her statement. ""Eventually all I could hear was heavy breathing and what sounded like moaning. Eventually Debbie stopped responding completely and I had lost her."" The phone call lasted 40 minutes before she ""lost her"", the inquiry heard. After the call ended, Ms Jabin saw footage of the burning tower and said she was glad she had not seen it before, as ""it would have been very difficult to detach myself from what was happening"". She said she ""cried a lot"" as she drove home from her shift, hearing Ms Lamprell's voice in her head. Another control room officer, based in Stratford, east London, also gave evidence on Monday. Angie Gotts took around 80 calls on the night of the fire, but said she would not tell residents to stay in their flats, having had a friend who had worked during the deadly tower block fire at Lakanal House fire in 2009. ""A friend of mine was blamed for the advice she gave to a resident and the advice she gave her was exactly what she was supposed to have done... the blame was all put on her,"" she said in her statement. ""I will tell the caller what I can and I will certainly pass all of their details (flat number, floor number, number of people and location) to the firefighters but I will not tell them to stay."" Hours into the fire, Ms Gotts recalled the volume of calls coming in dropping off. ""The lack of calls made it eerie in the control room. Someone said, 'What does this mean?' but we all know what it meant,"" she wrote. ""The atmosphere was one of stunned silence."" The public inquiry continues.

"Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi Russia and Turkey have agreed to create a demilitarised buffer zone in Syria's Idlib province to separate government forces from rebel fighters based there. Russian President Vladimir Putin said it would be 15km to 25km (9-15 miles) wide and come into force by 15 October. Troops from Russia, an ally of Syria's government, and Turkey, which backs the rebels, will patrol the zone. The UN had warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if the Syrian army launched an all-out assault to retake Idlib. The family under fire again as Idlib battle looms High stakes for Turkey in Syriaâs Idlib Why does the battle for Idlib matter? But after Monday's meeting between Mr Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the deal meant there would be no such operation in the region. The Russian president said that under the deal, all heavy weaponry, including tanks, rocket launch systems and mortar launchers operated by rebel groups would need to be pulled out of the buffer zone by 10 October. ""Radically-minded rebels"", including members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda that was once known as al-Nusra Front - would also have to leave the zone, Mr Putin added. It was not immediately clear if the zone included Idlib city. Mr Erdogan said: ""We will prevent a humanitarian tragedy which could happen as a result of military action."" He had earlier called for a ceasefire in northern Syria to prevent what he said would be a ""bloodbath"" and another major refugee crisis on Turkey's southern border. Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus Any diplomatic arrangement that postpones a full-scale onslaught against Idlib will be welcomed by the international community. Such an attack by the Assad government - backed by its Russian and Iranian allies - risked not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but also a direct military confrontation with Turkey. Members of the National Liberation Front, one of many rebel groups in Idlib Turkey has deployed troops at a number of locations in Idlib and has been reinforcing these over recent days. President Assad wants to reassert control over Idlib - the last province in rebel hands. Both he and the Russians want to destroy rebel groups they call ""terrorists"". It is hard to see exactly how a buffer zone arrangement involving Russia and Turkey can address these long-term problems. But averting an offensive for now may give breathing space for additional diplomatic moves. Idlib province is the last major stronghold of rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad for the past seven years, in a civil war that has killed more than 350,000 people. Idlib, and adjoining areas of Hama and Aleppo, are home to an estimated 2.9 million people, including one million children. Why is there a war in Syria? A sharp increase in hostilities since the start of September and fears of further escalation have led to the displacement of tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands in Idlib live in dire, overcrowded conditions, with a lack of basic services. Tens of thousands have been displaced recently in Idlib province Idlib is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions commanding up to 70,000 fighters. The dominant force is HTS, which the UN estimates has 10,000 fighters. Idlib is also strategically vital. It borders Turkey to the north and straddles major highways running south from Aleppo to Hama and the capital, Damascus, and west to the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia. If Idlib is taken by the government, it would leave the rebels with a few pockets of territory scattered across the country and effectively signal their military defeat.

"Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes The Senate has scheduled a public hearing on a sex assault claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for next week. Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who says he attacked her more than three decades ago, will both be able to testify. US President Donald Trump said earlier he expected ""a little delay"" to confirming his nominee. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, says the allegation is ""completely false"". He denies he was even at the 1982 high school party in question where his accuser, now a psychology professor in California, says he tried to rape her as his friend watched. The claim has jeopardised Judge Kavanaugh's formerly all-but certain-nomination for a lifetime job on the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh has denied the allegations against him Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley confirmed next Monday's hearing in a statement. ""As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr Ford has done deserves to be heard,"" said the Iowa Republican. Katty Kay: Kavanaugh debate fast becomes political battle Kavanaugh - where the story goes from here Mr Grassley had earlier stopped short of calling for a public hearing, or for delaying the committee's vote on the nominee. The judge last week finished four days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a vote on his confirmation had been planned for Thursday of this week. But Democrats demanded a delay in the vote in order to let the FBI investigate. Mr Grassley said the standard procedure would be for committee members to conduct telephone calls with both witnesses about their forthcoming testimony. But in a statement, the panel's Democrats refused to join in any phone call with Judge Kavanaugh. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? Senators from both parties had argued that Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford should be given the chance to testify before the panel. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters she would like the chance to observe Prof Ford to decide the credibility of her account. ""Obviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,"" she said. Two other Republican senators, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Bob Corker of Tennessee, earlier called for the vote to be delayed. This video can not be played Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh: ""I'm a team player"" Prof Ford detailed her story in a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein in July before going public in an article published in the Washington Post on Sunday. The Palo Alto University academic says the incident happened 36 years ago in a Maryland suburb outside Washington DC. Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes, then clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. They were students in different high schools. She was 15 and he was 17. Both he and his friend, who allegedly watched the incident, were drunk, she says. Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford says she spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. In a statement on Monday, Judge Kavanaugh vowed to ""refute"" the accusation before the congressional panel. He said in a statement issued by the White House: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone. ""Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday."" Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, told NBC's Today programme on Monday that ""if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she [Prof Ford] would have been raped"". Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The confirmation fight comes just weeks before November's congressional elections in which Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's party. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that backs Mr Trump's judicial picks, says it plans to launch a $1.5m (Â£1.1m) ad campaign backing Judge Kavanaugh. Mr Trump, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct that surfaced during the 2016 presidential election campaign, has not offered an opinion on the credibility of Prof Ford's allegation. At the White House on Monday, the Republican president said of the confirmation: ""If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay."" He dismissed as ""ridiculous"" a reporter's question about whether Judge Kavanaugh's nomination would be withdrawn. ""I think he's very much on track,"" Mr Trump said. The White House said in a statement: ""Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation.""

"Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh say they are both willing to testify Lawmakers from both sides of the US political divide have called for a delay in the vote on the nominee for the powerful Supreme Court. It follows an allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s against President Donald Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Kavanaugh denies the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. Both say they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel's vote on Mr Kavanaugh is at present scheduled for Thursday.

""We need to hear from her,"" he told news website Politico,external. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this.""

Without saying whether or not she would support a delay, Republican Susan Collins tweeted on Monday: ""Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee."" The Republican chairman of the committee, Chuck Grassley, issued a statement without addressing any delay in the vote or testimony. He said Prof Ford ""deserves to be heard"" and that the matter should be covered in follow-up calls to both her and Mr Kavanaugh, which he said he was trying to set up. Mr Grassley criticised both the Democrats and Prof Ford's lawyer for not bringing the allegations to the committee earlier.

Democratic Party Senator Dick Durbin, who serves on the judiciary committee, said the burden had been put on the panel to ""get to the bottom"" of the matter. Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn called on lawmakers to treat the process ""with bipartisan participation in a spirit of collaboration and concern for all involved"".

Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete. The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate. Senator Jeff Flake has clashed with Donald Trump previously The Republicans only have a single-vote majority on the committee, which they control 11 to 10, while they hold the Senate by just 51-49. Mr Kavanaughis strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views on issues such as abortion, and it seems unlikely any of them will cross the aisle to vote with their Republican colleagues. This means it would take just Mr Flake to potentially derail Thursday's committee vote, while only two Republican defections would swing the outcome away from Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher.

"There were plenty of twists and turns in the latest episode of BBC drama Bodyguard - but one had some viewers reaching for their mobile phones. At one point, Richard Madden's character, David Budd, gave out his mobile number. It was too tempting for a number of viewers, who couldn't resist calling it, to see if it got through to him. They were left disappointed and there are 20,000 reasons why. Or rather 20,000 combinations. That's the amount offake numbersset aside by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, for use in TV, radio and film. These include numbers for different geographic areas around the UK as well as mobile phone numbers. Millions have been hooked on the BBC political thriller Harry Rippon, communications manager for Ofcom, says this is to save anyone from having their phone number featured on TV - because usually, the first thing people do is call it. ""I think it happens quite a lot - if a number is onscreen, there's always the chance someone could call it,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""There's always someone who thinks: 'What if I call this number?' ""We've always had these numbers for this very reason."" That's possibly what happened after Bodyguard broadcast PC Budd's fake number. Some fans joked about noting it down. Allow Twitter content?

"Authorities were earlier forced to relocate the container full of corpses following complaints A refrigerated trailer containing at least 100 corpses in Mexico's western state of Jalisco has angered residents who have complained about the smell. Authorities said on Monday they were trying to relocate the container, which was rented after mortuaries in the city of Guadalajara became full. ""We have a lot of children in this neighbourhood... it could make us all sick,"" resident JosÃ© Luis Tovar said. Laws in Mexico prevent the cremation of bodies linked to violent crime. Local authorities said they were looking for a longer-term solution to store the bodies following a recent wave of violence. ""We ran out of cemetery plots where we could bury them,"" the head of the Jalisco forensic investigators unit, Luis Octavio Cotero, said. He added that a site was being established that was expected to facilitate some 800 corpses, AFP news agency reports. 'Mariachi musician' gunmen kill three in Mexico City Mexico finds 166 skulls in mass grave Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the cartels The refrigerated trailer had previously been parked at a warehouse in the neighbourhood of Duraznera, on the outskirts of Guadalajara, but after two weeks the residents began to complain of a foul stench and said the container was attracting flies. It was then moved to an empty lot in the suburb of Tlajomulco de ZÃºÃ±iga, but residents there began to protest at the weekend. ""We don't want it here. They need to put it somewhere else, it stinks,"" Mr Tovar said. Mexico has suffered a wave of violent killings in recent years. More than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since December 2006, when Mexico's government declared war on organised crime. Mexico experienced its most violent year in 2017 with more than 25,000 murders, official figures suggest. It is the highest annual tally since modern records began. Organised crime accounted for nearly three-quarters of those murders.

"The Irish border is the single biggest sticking point at this stage of the Brexit negotiations. The Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to leave the EU's customs union and single market but at the same time has promised no hardening of the border. That means no new physical infrastructure and no new checks or controls for customs or product standards Her solution is the Chequers plan, with its ""combined customs territory"" and ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules on goods and agriculture. Now, the European Research Group (ERG), which backs a ""clean-break Brexit"", has suggested another way, which avoids the need to follow all those EU rules. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the ERG, said it provided a solution for the Irish border ""in a way that any reasonable person would think meets the requirements of the European Union's concerns over the single market"". It has similarities to an earlier government plan, which proposed the continuation of some existing UK-EU arrangements and the use of technology to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. The Irish border: Brexit's 310-mile problem Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade Reality Check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland? Perhaps the most difficult issue for the Irish border is the movement of food and agriculture products. Those products are the major component of cross-border trade but they also face some of the strictest EU rules. The rules mean consignments of food or animals can enter the EU only through specified border inspection posts. Those involve mandatory document checks and a significant proportion of consignments must also be physically checked. It is likely the challenge posed by those rules nudged the prime minister towards the ""common rule book"", which would involve signing a treaty committing the UK to continued harmonisation with EU rules. The ERG approach is for an ""equivalence"" arrangement, where the EU would accept that, while UK food and agriculture rules would be different, they would still be as good as EU rules and would not put consumers at risk. It backs this up with reference to a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on food and plant safety, suggesting this would require the EU to offer equivalence However, many trade experts believe this overstates the particular strength of that agreement. The ERG document also mentions the equivalence provision in the EU-Canada trade deal - but it doesn't add that under that deal there are still documentary checks on all meat and dairy imports, with 10% subject to physical checks. The EU has been prepared to remove requirements for border inspection but only with countries that have adopted its rules. Switzerland is an example - it modifies its laws in response to changes in EU legislation and must monitor third-country exports at EU-approved border inspection posts. So, the sort of equivalence the ERG is hoping for would mean a unique approach by the EU. Please upgrade your browser One intriguing aspect of the ERG report is that, when it comes to agricultural products, it approves of the existing arrangements that mean the whole island of Ireland is a ""common biosecurity zone"". This means that animals being moved from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are subject to checks and controls, even though this is an internal UK movement. Those animals need an import licence and the exporter needs to arrange for an approved vet to examine the animals before they leave for Northern Ireland. The vet will then apply for an export health certificate. An animal transport certificate is also required. The animals and all the paperwork are checked on arrival at Larne Harbour, County Antrim. The report says: ""It has been recognised by all communities on the island of Ireland that it is sensible to capitalise on the protection afforded by the sea."" Does that leave the door open to additional checks, for example, of food products, that are being imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland? That would eliminate the need for border inspection posts but is unlikely to be approved of by the Democratic Unionist Party, whose support in Parliament the government needs. And again, this is an area where a flexible approach would be required by the EU as there is no other example of a common biosecurity zone between the EU and a region of a non-EU country. Another area where the ERG is hoping for an accommodating approach from the EU is on VAT. The report proposes that the UK would have continued access to the EU's VAT Information Exchange System (VIES). That would help avoid the need for VAT liabilities to be assessed by customs officials as products arrived at the Irish border. The ERG also describes the VAT system as providing a framework for streamlining customs controls. That streamlining involves: filing documents electronically the use of licensed customs brokers having any inspections at the factory rather than the border Familiar plans for ""trusted trader"" schemes are also laid out. The concern for small businesses in particular is that this is not frictionless trade - it means more red tape and the use of customs brokers, for example, would mean additional costs. More fundamentally, it is not at all clear on what terms the EU would allow continued access to the VIES and if those terms would be acceptable to the ERG. Would the UK agree to continued adherence to the EU VAT Directive and oversight from the European Court of Justice? Would the UK seek an even deeper VAT agreement than the one Norway was - an arrangement that took four years to negotiate?

"It's felt like a long time to get this far. Decades of debate about our place in the EU. Years of push me, pull you debates on the right, about whether there should be a referendum on our membership of the European Union. The crashing highs and lows, and lows and highs of the referendum campaign itself. And since then, more than 18 months of the Brexit process squeezing the life out of almost everything else in our politics - still a subject of huge division, of frustration, of thrill and excitement, of concern and fascination and question marks. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, says May Reality Check: How are Brexit preparations getting on? Much of 'Brexit' is mind-numbing to many in its complexity and level of detail. Some of the political game-playing is tedious soap opera to all but a precious few. The parliamentary process is vital but labyrinthine. The layers upon layers of party divisions are ever shifting, and hard to track. But what looks like a series of individual clashes, or indeed occasionally a shambles, matters. Because the eventual decisions that will and are being made in all of our names are a product of all of those tangles, and they will affect our livelihoods and the place of the country in the world for many years to come. Please upgrade your browser With six months to go, and a critical meeting of EU leaders later this week, where the UK hopes to move into the next phase, it's worth taking a breath and reflecting, in a way that's not exhaustive,  on where this process has got to. The most likely outcome right now is that a deal between the UK and the EU will be done in November. If that happens it will be made up of a legally binding withdrawal agreement - that contains the cash, what happens to citizens on both sides, and in theory, a solution for Northern Ireland. Alongside that will be the document that in theory shapes the future of the relationship for good - the political declaration. However, as we joked at the beginning of the process that the deal was likely in the end to be a fudge, so it seems that could come to pass. Behind the scenes diplomats and politicians are starting to talk about the declaration being vague, in order that trickiest issues don't have to be resolved yet. A senior cabinet minister told me last week, 'ambiguity might be the way out'. Michael Gove even suggested publicly on Sunday that this year's deal doesn't have to be the end of the story. One diplomat told me that a vague deal might be the way through but that means Brexit would then essentially go on for years - 'If the vagueness is the solution then at the end we start again'. This set of Brexit talks would conclude, only for years of a next phase to begin. But this is becoming known as 'blind Brexit', and while it is a possible way out of the talks it has obvious problems. One MP joked that we might end up with an 'agreement of adjectives'. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The most pressing argument against a vague deal is concern over the Irish border. Again in his column in the Daily Telegraph, the former foreign secretary expresses his frustration with how that question has become such a central issue in the talks. But frankly, it's been the blindingly obvious case for many months, that without a convincing arrangement coming from the UK side, the EU will find it extremely difficult to do the deal, without forcing their backstop. There's talk in negotiation circles of 'backstop 2', there's talk of a way of softening the language around the EU's position. And, of course, Brexiteers are trying hard to force Theresa May to put a different set of arrangements on the table. There is, however, no chance of her shifting, at least not until after the end of the Conservative conference. Her Chequers agreement where officials and ministers drafted a way through the EU and UK red lines is her plan for now and she isn't budging until she is forced to. Without going through the arguments as we have discussed many times here, her Chequers deal is one of the reasons why her job is at risk. Since the election, her handling of Brexit has made her vulnerable to circling rivals in the Tory party. Her advocates believe she has displayed extraordinary resilience holding on so far. But there is a sense of foreboding around the place. More and more MPs are willing to say publicly that after Brexit her time is limited. One senior MP suggested to me that if those close to the Prime Minister aren't telling her that then they are in fact doing her a disservice. The Tories have been lucky though in one sense. An opposition party that was less distracted by its own woes could be tearing strips off the government daily. As it is, with Labour's own problems so clearly on display, the government is in a less precarious position than you might expect. But they are vulnerable, enormously vulnerable, in the next couple of months. Assuming that there is a deal of some sorts (if it is possible to assume anything), the government is not certain to be able to get the vote through the House of Commons. Government insiders believe the vote will get through, that most MPs will choose the relative stability of a deal, rather than take the risk. One Tory MP even said last week, 'any deal is better than no deal'. But, and it is a big but, Tory hard core eurosceptics might join with the opposition parties to bring the deal down. They really might.  If that happens there is no map and no precedent. Those campaigning vigorously for a second referendum believe that could be their opportunity to push for a second vote. The Labour  Party hope that would bring a general election giving them an opportunity to win. A vote could sink Theresa May, or even re-open the referendum. The bumps of the last two years could be nothing in comparison to that.

"This video can not be played Theresa May told Panorama: 'I think that the alternative to that (the Chequers plan) will be not having a deal' My deal or no deal! An agreement or Armageddon! Compromise or catastrophe! This is not of course a subject to be flippant about. And it is easy to see why the government has moved already to presenting the next couple of months of fraught activity in Westminster as already being a decision for MPs - back Theresa May whatever she brings back from Brussels or take a reckless roll of the dice. There is nothing funny about the forecasts of what could happen if there is no deal. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Preparing for two 'no deal' scenarios Number 10 believes that will be the rub, the reality of the situation. But while they might wish they were at the closing stage where those arguments will play, they are not there yet. There are still forces at play that could shape the outcome of the deal, before the Tory whips can start counting up the votes. First - some Brexiteers are absolutely serious and organised about trying to force Theresa May to shift her plans. They are already making a lot of political noise. They will demand much of the oxygen at the Tory conference and could make life for the government extremely hard on what one described as 'any or all' votes in the run-up to the Brexit deal. It doesn't seem necessarily clear to me why the PM would be able to hold off all their demands this time, when on many previous occasions she has had to budge a little. In turn, some former Remainers plan to use other legislation coming back to Parliament to have another go at softening the government's position. Are Eurosceptic Tories really ready to move against May? Brexit: All you need to know There is a putative plan for another amendment to leave the country in the European economic area, starting with changing the Trade Bill in the House of Lords. One MP involved told me: ""Some MPs talk about opposing no deal but what does that really mean? There has to be a fallback plan and this amendment could lead the way to finding a solution."" It doesn't mean that those former Remainers will be successful this time around, but it doesn't mean they won't give it a good try. Add to that the increasing visibility of those campaigning for a second referendum. They know such a vote could only really come out of the turmoil of a no-deal scenario. But they are trying, extremely hard, to shift the terms of the debate. Lastly and most importantly, Theresa May's plan is a set of proposals for negotiation. While we may see friendlier rhetoric this week at an EU leaders' shindig in Salzburg, they are never going to accept her compromise in one big chunk. There will be a process of push and shove, there will have to be some more compromise. The final terms could make the calculations for MPs very different. Even some government ministers privately say they can't be sure they will back the PM until that much later stage. In the end Number 10 may well be right - they could get their way in Parliament, pushing through a historic deal not by making a persuasive case for its merits but by talking up the risks of saying no. Common sense? Or just scare tactics? That's the call MPs may have to face.

"Commuters delayed at Waterloo station Severe weather and new timetable disruption have led to the worst punctuality on Britain's railways for 12 years, new figures show. Fourteen percent of trains missed the industry measure of punctuality in the 12 months to August, according to the railways watchdog. It is the highest level of delays since 2006, when 14.2% of trains were late. The body representing the rail industry said it was ""investing billions"" but it was time for ""root and branch reform"". The figures, published by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), come after a series of major issues hit the rail network during the past 12 months. In February and March, the period of freezing weather nicknamed the Beast from the East brought parts of the network to a standstill. And new timetables introduced on 20 May caused serious disruption to commuters in the north and south-east of England. On Thursday, the ORR will publish its report into the causes of the timetable chaos. That has previously been blamed on delayed electrification in the north, poor planning by train operators and the decision by ministers to phase in the introduction of new Govia Thameslink Railway services. The government is expected to announcea review of the railwayson Thursday, led by Keith Williams, the deputy chairman of department store John Lewis. It is expected to respond to criticisms of the franchising model, after issues such as thecollapse of the East Coast Mainline franchisein May. Campaign for Better Transport chief executive Darren Shirley urged the Government and train operators to ""learn from the mistakes of the recent timetable chaos"". He said that further fare hikes would ""risk further denting passengers' confidence in the railways"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said reliability was the ""key priority"" for commuters. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said it was ""investing billions to ease congestion, reduce delays and minimise disruption"". Robert Nisbet, the group's regional director, said it would support a fundamental rethink of the way the rail network is run. ""We have been saying that the time is right for root and branch reform of the railway so that it can deliver more for passengers, communities, businesses and taxpayers,"" he said.

Some of the loudest cheers came when he said Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader if he does not agree to demands from his own MPs and party members for a referendum on the final Brexit deal at their party conference next week. ""If Jeremy Corbyn will not say 'I will support a People's Vote and I will fight Brexit', Labour members should wave him goodbye,"" said Sir Vince. ""He is currently letting down the many people in Labour's heartland who now see Brexit for what it is. It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""

He described Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as ""fundamentalists"" for which ""the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant"". He was due to say that ""years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it.""

The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump. ""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day. ""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'."" It was Sir Vince's second leader's speech to conference Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"". The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"". But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions. I'm not the next Lib Dem leader - Miller Do Lib Dem members want a new party? Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"". He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels. ""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. Sir Vince's predecessor Tim Farron listens to the speech This video can not be played In full: Sir Vince Cable's full speech to 2018 Lib Dem conference The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"". He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"". The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s. ""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference. Sir Vince also used his speech to set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs. He said the party was still ""very pale and very male"", adding: ""We must change that and keep growing.""

"Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to root out the ""scourge of anti-Semitism"" in a speech. Mrs May said some Jews are ""fearful of the future"" but that anti-Semites do not speak for the ""overwhelming majority of people in our country"". The PM said criticising Israel could never be an excuse for questioning its right to exist or for ""hatred against the Jewish people"". ""I stand with you,"" she said at the United Jewish Israel Appeal dinner. Reality Check: Is anti-Semitism on the rise? The UJIA is a charity that works with young people in Israel and the UK Jewish community. ""If we are to stand up for the values that we share - then one of the things we need to do is give young Jewish people the confidence to be proud of their identity - as British, Jewish and Zionist too,"" Mrs May said. ""There is no contradiction between these identities - and we must never let anyone try to suggest that there should be."" This video can not be played Mark Lewis and Mandy Blumenthal say they're leaving the UK because of anti-Semitism Claiming Israel is a ""racist endeavour"" - one of the examples of anti-Semitism listed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance - is ""abhorrent"" and an attempt to separate Jews in the UK from their connection with Israel, she added. The Labour Party recently adopted the IHRA code and examples in full following a drawn-out party row, alongside a statement that this would not undermine free speech on Israel. The prime minister said criticising Israel's actions ""can never be an excuse for questioning Israel's right to exist, any more than criticising Britain's actions could be an excuse for questioning our right to exist"". She added: ""And criticising the government of Israel is never - and can never be - an excuse for hatred against the Jewish people - any more than criticising the British government would be an excuse for hatred against the British people."" Mrs May speech also comes after the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was disappointed that Conservative MEPs refused back a censure motion against Hungary's government, which is accused of attacks on minorities and the rule of law.

"This video can not be played The attempted robbery was over in about 30 seconds An 85-year-old great grandfather who tackled would-be robbers wielding a sawn-off shotgun and hammers has become an internet hit. Denis O'Connor was in the Bar One Racing office in Glanmire, County Cork, on Saturday when three raiders burst through the door. One jumped the counter and threatened manager Tim Murphy. Another pointed a shotgun at Mr O'Connor. CCTV footage shows Mr O'Connor refusing to back down. The three raiders burst into the office at about 18:20 local time, demanding the contents of the safe. As Mr Murphy tackled one man who threatened him with a hammer, Mr O'Connor grappled with another of the masked men and shoved him out from behind the counter. The raider then fled. He then went after a second man who ran off. It was all over in about 30 seconds but the video has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on the internet. Mr Murphy told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he would be forever grateful for the pensioner's help in foiling the robbery. Denis O'Connor has since been back to his local betting office but has declined requests for interview Irish police have been trawling CCTV footage in a bid to catch the men. Their advice to people is not to intervene in a robbery. Meanwhile, Mr O'Connor seems none the worse for his ordeal. Irish broadcaster RTÃ reports that he declined interview requests and spent Monday morning playing pitch and putt. He is just keen for the fuss of publicity to blow over.

"Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS trader convicted of fraud, has been given a temporary reprieve from deportation to Ghana, where he was born. Adoboli was expected to be put on a charter flight late on Tuesday, but a judge has awarded a last-minute judicial review of his case. The reprieve will last ""until such time as the outcome of the review is determined"", the judge said. Adoboli served four years of a seven-year sentence for a Â£1.4bn fraud. He was released in 2015 and spent time since in a mixture of paid and unpaid work which his lawyers had argued was aimed at sharing the lessons learned from his experience. He has delivered training to people in the banking industry and to civil servants, and was staying in Livingston, West Lothian, prior to his detention. Kweku Adoboli outside court during his trial He is currently being held at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow, but attempts are now being made to secure bail for him. Campaigner and friend Nick Hopewell-Smith said ""common sense"" had prevailed. ""Kweku Adoboli may have been born elsewhere, but he is more British, with more loyalty to Britain, than many people with a passport,"" he said. That loyalty had been ""severely tested"" by the actions of the Home Office, he added. Adoboli left Ghana at the age of four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Since he was detained on 3 September, almost 75,000 people have signed a petition against his deportation, with more than 130 members of the UK and Scottish parliaments signing a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid asking him to intervene. Ex-UBS trader who lost Â£1.4bn faces deportation to Ghana UBS Rogue trader: It could happen again Illegal immigration: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? Immigration minister Caroline Nokes had said earlier in a letter that all foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment were subject to automatic deportation, unless there were compelling reasons for them to remain. The public expected ""robust action"" to be taken against foreign nationals who had committed crimes, she wrote. Adoboli was found guilty for booking fictitious trades to cover up big losses during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2011. He pleaded not guilty, saying his senior managers knew what he was doing and encouraged him to take risks.

"French and UK boats collided in the channel when the row broke out in August British and French fishermen have reached a deal to end the scrap over scallops in the English Channel. The agreement, starting on Tuesday, will see larger British boats withdrawing in return for greater fishing rights elsewhere. In August, boats collided and fishermen threw stones at each other as the French accused UK boats of depleting scallop stocks. British fishermen said they were legally entitled to fish there. Under the terms of the new deal, UK scallop dredgers over 15m long will leave the scallop beds off the coast of Normandy from midnight for six weeks. In return, France will transfer fishing rights for scallops in areas such as the Irish Sea. Smaller British boats are not restricted under the deal and can continue to fish in the Bay of Seine, where the row broke out. Fisheries minister George Eustice said: ""I commend the UK fishing industry for its patience throughout negotiations and welcome this pragmatic outcome."" Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? There have been tensions over scallop supplies in the area for 15 years. French rules prevent scallop fishing between 15 May and 1 October - allowing stocks to recover in the spawning season - but British boats can fish year-round. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? Over the past five years a deal kept the peace, with larger British boats staying out of the area in return for more fishing rights elsewhere. That deal lapsed, but when UK boats returned overnight on August 27 they were met by around 40 French craft and pelted with rocks. French police said both sides threw missiles. The action was condemned by Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, as ""high seas piracy"". About 1,350 jobs depend on the Â£120m UK scallop industry. About 60% of the catch is exported - with much of it being bought by the French. But experts warned in 2016 that the fishing effort by France, the UK, Belgium and Ireland in the Bay of Seine was depleting stocks too fast. An earlier attempt to broker a deal was scuppered. The UK and France had tried to reach an agreement which would see all British boats staying out of the disputed territory during the French no-fishing period. But the parties could not agree on the compensation package for British boats, which had been free to harvest scallops there throughout the year. Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops?

"Rhys O'Neill's son was able to pick a peach from the tree his father bought for his mum on their first date ""The first time I visited my girlfriend at college I bought a peach tree from a local nursery and I told her someday we will eat peaches from it."" These were the words 30-year-old Rhys O'Neill, from Vermont, in the US, wrote in a Redditpost,externalwhich received more than 100,000 upvotes. ""Well, it worked better than I planned. Here is our son eating a peach from that very tree"", he added. One Reddit user describes their story as a ""fairy tale"". Rhys O'Neill says this photo ""is proof for all those hardcore Reddit users that my story is real"" Rhys said he knew instantly he loved his girlfriend, Lindsy. In fact, when he bought the peach tree he already knew they would be eating the fruit from it together. ""Our first big date was at her college. I didn't know how to impress her,"" he told the BBC. Rhys said he knew it took a long time for peaches to develop so if he bought the tree it would show her he was serious. The then 21-year-old told Lindsy: ""Some day we're going to eat peaches."" She told her friends she would be marrying him. Rhys planted the tree in front of his family's house in Vermont. That was eight years ago. The pair currently live in that same house, although they have moved back and forth during their five years together. Now they are married and have two children. This summer is the first time the tree has produced peaches. Rhys said his 19-month-old son loved eating the peach but had no idea of the significance of the tree. ""He loved it. He took bites out of it,"" said Rhys. ""He threw a bit of it in his paddling pool."" The peach tree stands in the garden of the family home Rhys said his Reddit post was his first ever on the social media site. ""My brother can't believe it - my first post and I get 100,000 upvotes."" Although Rhys said the majority of comments in response had been positive, some people have called him ""creepy"" and ""highly inappropriate"". But Rhys says: ""I loved her very quickly, so the peach tree was appropriate. We just knew we were right for each other."" Texan-born Rhys said he'd ""completely forgotten"" about the tree for eight years. ""No one watered it. No one pruned it. It's been through Vermont winters."" ""Yet somehow the peaches appeared this summer."" Apple unveils iPhone XS and new Watch Yoga pants row continues in US school US school to paddle students as punishment Rhys and Lindsy say they knew they were made for each other The fruit appeared at a very opportune moment for the couple, as they have a three-month-old baby girl and aren't getting much sleep.

Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also took home one of the night's big prizes - best leading actor in a drama series. Game of Thrones won two prizes - best drama series and supporting actor for Peter Dinklage - while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel scooped five comedy awards. However, two hotly-tipped shows - Atlanta and The Handmaid's Tale - failed to replicate their successes from last year and went home empty-handed.

The 8 best moments (and 1 that didn't happen) In pictures: The Emmys red carpet The ceremony's winners in full In her acceptance speech, the British star described her time on The Crown as ""the most extraordinary two-and-a-half years of my life"". She said: ""I was given a role I never thought I would ever get a chance to play, and I met people who I will love for ever and ever. ""And the show goes on, which makes me so proud. So I dedicate this to the next cast, the next generation, and I also dedicate this to [her co-star] Matt Smith.""

Matthew Rhys' accent surprises Welsh fans The Emmy-winning TV shows you've never heard of Charlie Brooker, the British creator of Black Mirror and his co-writer William Bridges won best writing for a limited series. John Oliver added to the British success at the ceremony, picking up the prize for best variety talk series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The Marvellous Mrs Maisel was one of the night's other biggest winners - adding five trophies to the four it wonlast week at the Creative Arts Emmys. The series took home best writing, directing, lead actress and supporting actress in the comedy categories, as well as one of the night's big prizes - best comedy series. Henry Winkler took home a trophy - 42 years after his first nomination The Assassination of Gianni Versace was also one of Monday's big winners - scooping best limited series, best directing for a limited series, and best lead actor in a limited series for Darren Criss. Henry Winkler won his first Emmy - supporting actor in a comedy series for his role in Barry - 42 years after he was first nominated for playing The Fonz in Happy Days.

In addition to his family and co-workers, Daniels thanked the streaming service for ""letting artists be artists"". He added: ""Little tip for you young actors - when they call and say 'Can you ride a horse?' don't lie. You will find on day one that you're in the Kentucky Derby."" Regina King received the best actress in a limited series award from RuPaul and Leslie Jones Put together with the Creative Arts Emmys handed out last week, this year's awards tally saw Netflix and HBO tied, with 23 awards each. But one of the night's most memorable moments came from Glen Weiss, who proposed to his girlfriend from the stage during his speech. This video can not be played Emmys proposal While accepting outstanding directing for a variety special for The Oscars, he spoke to his partner Jan Svendsen, who was sitting in the audience. ""You wonder why I don't like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife,"" he said as the crowd began cheering. Svendsen, who looked shocked and delighted, then made her way up to the stage to accept his proposal. Weiss said he was giving her the ring ""that my dad put on my mom's finger 67 years ago"". His proposal came just two weeks after the death of his mother, which he also referred to in his speech. Rhys joked about the moment later in the night, telling the audience as he collected his award that his girlfriend had whispered to him: ""If you propose to me I will punch you clean in the mouth."" Sandra Oh's mother rocks hanbok at Emmys Colin Jost and Michael Che are hosting the ceremony The ceremony took place at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, with Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon kicking off proceedings. ""We're celebrating the fact that this year's Emmy Awards has the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history,"" Thompson said. ""One step closer to a black Sheldon,"" he joked - referring to The Big Bang Theory's most famous character. The pair then embarked on a parody song called We Solved It - suggesting the Emmys had single-handedly fixed Hollywood's lack of diversity - which featured cameo appearances from Sandra Oh and John Legend. John Legend made an appearance in the opening musical number about Hollywood diversity - titled We Solved It Ceremony hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che then took to the stage - referencing the fact that streaming service Netflix received the most nods this year in their opening monologue. ""NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,"" Che said, adding: ""Which is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support"". Because the Emmys have a total of 122 categories, the less high profile awards weregiven out last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys, with 26 awarded on Monday night.

"ValtÃ²nyc is one of a number of artists to be sentenced for ""glorifying terrorism"" in Spain A Belgian court has said it will not extradite a rapper who fled Spain earlier this year after being convicted over his controversial lyrics. Josep Miquel Arenas BeltrÃ¡n, known as ValtÃ²nyc, was found guilty of insulting the monarchy and glorifying terrorism. Spain issued an EU arrest warrant after the rapper disappeared before starting his three-and-a-half-year prison term. But a judge in Ghent refused the extradition request on Monday, according to ValtÃ²nyc's defence team. ""The judge has decided there will be no extradition and discarded all three charges,"" lawyer Simon Bekaert told reporters. Rapper on run from jail has 'no regrets' The Spanish rappers getting 'terror' sentences for songs Another lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, was quoted by Spanish news agency Efe as saying: ""The judge understands that this is freedom of expression and that none of the phrases in his songs contained criminal content."" In a message on Twitter, ValtÃ²nyc thanked his fans and said: ""History is written by those who win, and we are still winning."" It is not yet clear if Belgian prosecutors will appeal the decision. ValtÃ²nyc has previously said he did not regret his lyrics, which include a song with the words: ""The king has a rendezvous at the village square, with a noose around his neck."" He told the BBC in July thathis decision to leave Spain was inspired by Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after Madrid issued an arrest warrant against him over the region's declaration of independence last year. A number of artists have been found guilty of glorifying terrorism in Spain over the past year, under laws described as ""draconian"" by Amnesty International.

"Irene Collins was attacked by the dog in the kitchen of her home A woman died after she was attacked by a police dog that was searching her garden for a suspected drug dealer, an inquest heard. Irene Collins, 73, had allowed officers to search her Middlesbrough property for the man in July 2014. The German shepherd managed to get into her house and twice bit Mrs Collins, who died four days later in hospital. A post-mortem exam showed she died from lung disease, but a pathologist said her death was hastened by the bites. Assistant Coroner Karin Welch told the inquest jury that no-one was on trial, with the hearing about establishing facts around Mrs Collins's death. It would consider, among other topics, the dog's training, previous behaviour and how it got into her home. The jury was told the police helicopter had been involved in the search for the suspect in back gardens in Penrith Road, Park End, at about 21:00 BST on 16 July 2014. PC Mark Baines and his dog, Dano, were called in to help as trees and undergrowth were blocking the view. Another officer Sgt Neil Yates told the jury he gained permission from Mrs Collins to search the garden but agreed she would not have been aware a dog would be involved. He said he heard on the radio she had been bitten and went into the house to see Dano biting her forearm and PC Baines shouting for it to ""leave"", and grabbing its collar. PC Baines managed to get the dog away into the hallway and Sgt Yates went to treat her. However, there was only an archway linking the hall and kitchen and the dog got free and bit her on the leg. Sgt Yates told the hearing Mrs Collins was ""screaming, upset, crying, saying 'Why has this happened to me?'."" Matthew Donkin, for the family, asked if Sgt Yates, who was armed, ever considered shooting the dog. He said: ""I considered everything but that was not an option that was anywhere near viable. ""I was confident he would get the dog off in a reasonable time."" The hearing, at Teesside Magistrates' Court, continues.

"MP Tobias Ellwood rushed to the aid of PC Keith Palmer after the attack An MP who fought to save the life of PC Keith Palmer during last year's Westminster terror attack has told an inquest how a doctor ordered him to stop giving CPR. Tobias Ellwood rushed to helpPC Palmer after he was stabbed by Khalid Masood on 22 March. But a doctor told Mr Ellwood, ""you've done your best"", and PC Palmer died. After almost breaking down in court, the MP said: ""[We] closed the eyes and then I said 'I'm sorry'."" Mr Ellwood said that if he had taken his normal route into Parliament, he would have been closer to Masood as he launched the attack. ""I know I would have stepped forward and I regret not having the opportunity to do so,"" he added. Four other people died after Masood drove into them on Westminster Bridge. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers during the attack - will take place afterwards. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Watch: 'Hero' MP's emotional terror attack defiance Westminster attack PC 'unprotected' at gate Mr Ellwood - Conservative MP for Bournemouth East and a medically trained former Army officer - told the court he was in a meeting close by when the attack occurred. He said he heard a crash followed by screams, adding: ""These were not screams of pain... these were screams of shock."" After running through crowds of people with ""panic in their eyes"" and hearing shots fired, Mr Ellwood said he saw a number of police officers crouched near Carriage Gate - which leads to New Palace Yard, outside the Houses of Parliament - and PC Palmer and Masood on the floor. He said the three officers helping PC Palmer looked like they needed assistance, so he ran towards them. They told him he was risking his life because of the chance of a secondary attack, but the MP - whose brother died in the Bali attack in 2002 - told the court: ""My brother was killed in a secondary attack... so I was very aware of that. ""I was concerned about what would happen if things were to ratchet up, but my immediate concern was that we had somebody who was clearly badly bleeding and needed assistance."" PC Keith Palmer was pronounced dead at 15:15 on the day of the attack Mr Ellwood said PC Palmer was unconscious, but that he still had a pulse, telling the court: ""I was encouraged that we'd arrived on the scene early enough to do something."" But PC Palmer's heart stopped, and Mr Ellwood had to begin chest compressions while someone else gave the officer mouth-to-mouth. ""By this time the whole of Westminster was very silent,"" he said. A medical team arrived by helicopter and moved PC Palmer so they could operate on him in the courtyard. Mr Ellwood had to pause in the witness box, before saying: ""Forgive me, it's sometimes easier to do the helping rather than to talk about it afterwards."" Despite their efforts, the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. Mr Ellwood said: ""I told a doctor present 'you're going to have to order me to stop', and the medic said, 'Sir, you've done your best, but you do need to stop'. ""We both covered the body as best we could, closed the eyes and I said: 'I'm sorry.' ""It was a very strange end to a very traumatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left completely alone with just one other person."" Dr Antony Hudson from London's Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, who performed the surgery on PC Palmer, told the court it would have been ""nearly impossible to return a cardiac output"" to a patient in that condition. By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old Bailey Tobias Ellwood came to Court One at the Old Bailey today to give evidence - not as an MP, but as a man who tried to help save the life of a dying police officer. He stood in the witness box for nearly an hour, at times with his hands gripped onto the oak-panelled sides. His voice, calm and measured, set against the ""screams of shock"" and ""panic in peoples eyes"" which he described. He paused every so often as the memories of that day came back. As he began describing the surgery carried out on PC Palmer on the ground, he stopped talking and stayed silent for some seconds. When Mr Ellwood finished his evidence, the barrister for PC Palmer's widow thanked him for his efforts to help the officer. Despite his harrowing experience, Mr Ellwood called on other members of the public to ""step forward"" in the face of terrorist incidents. He told the court: ""I know the official advice is to step back, report it. ""[But] I find myself countering that somewhat, because if more of us do step forward as we saw in the Manchester attack - London Bridge and Westminster Bridge as well - the message gets through that no terrorist is going to win."" Asked by the lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, about security in Westminster, Mr Ellwood said there had always been a ""sense of vulnerability"" around the Houses of Parliament and that, at times, there had been less firearms protection at the site than he would have liked. But he did not want it to become ""a tower of protection"", as it would ""change the face of what Parliament is about"". The MP added: ""[With] the level of security we have in place [now], I'm not sure we could do more.""

"The star recently announced she was pregnant with her second child In an emotional interview, country star Carrie Underwood has revealed she suffered three miscarriages in the last two years. The star told CBS News she reached her lowest point earlier this year when it seemed she might have a fourth. ""I was just sobbing,"" she said. ""I was like, 'Why on earth do I keep getting pregnant if I can't have a kid?'"" The 35-year-old said she ""got mad"" at God and asked: ""What is this? Either shut the door or let me have a kid."" She added: ""For the first time, I feel like I actually told God how I felt. ""That was like a Saturday - and the Monday I went to the doctor to, like, confirm, another miscarriage. And they told me everything was great. ""He heard me,"" she continued. The star, who has a son Isaiah, 3, with her hockey player husband Mike Fisher, is now expecting a second child.

Before revealing her struggles with fertility, Underwood had faced criticism for suggesting she was too old to have children naturally. In aninterview with Redbook,external, Underwood said: ""I'm 35, so we may have missed our chance to have a big family. We always talk about adoption and about doing it when our child or children are a little older."" Many fans applauded her openness but some felt she was misguided. Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy up to but not including 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby is lost after this point it is classed as a stillbirth Unlike stillbirths, miscarriages do not have to be registered or recorded anywhere so there are no official statistics, but it is estimated that about one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage The majority of miscarriages happen within the first 12 weeks and by far the majority of those happen within the first eight weeks. When a woman gets to the second trimester - the middle three months of pregnancy - there is a much smaller likelihood of miscarriage About half of miscarriages are thought to happen because something has gone wrong with the early development of the egg cell or sperm cell. Miscarriages can also happen because of a blood clotting problem which can starve the baby of oxygen, hormonal problems, a problem with the shape or strength of the uterus or cervix, large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in the uterus, or infection The main two risk factors for miscarriage are a woman's age and the number of miscarriages she has had before. As women age, their eggs too get older and there are more likely to be abnormalities Source: Miscarriage Association,external ""You need to know your window for having children is not closed,""wrote one Twitter user,external. ""You can still have healthy children. 35 is not old, 35 is not too late, 35 is fine."" ""I totally get it,""said a fan on Facebook,external. ""We have gone back and forth about trying again and 35 was my cut off age. But now I'm 35, I'm thinking about it. I feel the clock ticking like I'm sure she does."" Underwood announced her pregnancy shortly after the interview was published; and proudly showed off her baby bump during a surprise performance on Keith Urban's US tour on 24 August. She recently had to cancel two UK appearances, at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park and the Long Road festival, due to illness. The star released a new album, Cry Pretty, last Friday and told CBS the title track had been inspired by her tough 2017, which also included a nasty fall that left her needing more than 40 stitches on her face and surgery for a broken wrist. ""I would literally have these horrible things going on in my life, and then have to go smile and, like, do some interviews or, like, do a photo shoot or something, you know?

"Mr Musk (R) alleged that British diver Mr Unsworth (L) had a ""child bride"" A British cave diver is suing tech billionaire Elon Musk for defamation after his repeated claims the diver is a child abuser. Vernon Unsworth helped with the rescue of 12 Thai teenagers from a flooded cave in July. Mr Musk has made several accusations against Mr Unsworth without evidence, including that he was a ""child rapist"". The lawsuit seeks $75,000 (Â£57,000) in compensation and an injunction against Mr Musk to stop further allegations. The filing also says Mr Unsworth is seeking ""punitive damages"" as well as the compensation, ""to punish him for his wrongdoing and deter him from repeating such heinous conduct"". It says Mr Musk sometimes used his Twitter account and emails to ""publish to the world false and defamatory accusations"" against the Briton. His account had over 22.5 million followers during this time, the filing states. The South African-born head of Tesla previously tweeted it was ""strange he hasn't sued me"" when Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action. Allow Twitter content?

A separate suit will follow in London, the filing says. ""Musk's influence and wealth cannot convert his lies into truth or protect him from accountability for his wrongdoing in a court of law,"" Mr Unsworth's US attorney, L Lin Wood, said. by Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent The first amendment of the United States Constitution which protects free speech makes defamation a challenging legal action to bring. A plaintiff (the person bringing the case) has to prove the statement made about them is false and that it has caused them material harm. However, the toughest hurdle is that if the person bringing the case is regarded as a public figure - and 'public figure' is given a pretty wide interpretation - it has to be proved that the defendant acted maliciously. In other words that the person making the statement knew it to be false and went on to make it. Another way of putting it would be that it must be proved that the defendant knowingly lied with the intention of harming the plaintiff. The pair first clashed over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help with the cave rescue. The entrepreneur postedfootage of the vehicle on Twitter,externaland suggested it could be used to help save the trapped teens. Allow Twitter content?

"There was a spike in deaths in England at the start of this summer's heatwave,new data reveals,external. But statisticians say it is too early to tell how many of them can be attributed directly to the heat. On 25 and 26 June, when temperatures soared, there were 259 more deaths than the five-year average of 2,146 for those two days. It coincided with temperatures rising above the level at which experts say heat-related deaths can occur. The Office for National Statistics, which released the data, says it still needs to look at figures for July and August, as well as more information about registered causes of death, before assessing the reasons behind the rise. The summer was the joint-hottest on record for the UK as a whole and the hottest ever in England, with the temperature peaking at 35.3C (95.5F) in Faversham, Kent, on 26 July. A heatwave can affect anyone, but the most vulnerable are older people, babies and young children and people with pre-existing health problems. On 21 and 22 June there were 214 fewer deaths than the five-year average for the same period, the quarterly report by the Office for National Statistics for the period from 1 April to 30 June shows. But when the temperature climbed into the high 20s and a heatwave alert was issued by Public Health England on 25 June, the number rose to above the average. There were 1,205 deaths on that day and 1,200 on the following day, 26 June 2018. That compared with an average of 1,072 and 1,074, respectively for the same time of year in the previous five years (2013-2017). Maximum temperatures exceeded 24.5C - the level at which Public Health England warns that excess heat-related deaths may begin to become apparent - from 25 June, when a high of 30.1C (86.1F) - the UK'shottest of the yearat that point - was recorded in London. During that period, there were 382 more deaths than the average for the same period from 2013 to 2017. A peak and fall in the number of deaths was also recorded in April, coinciding with another spell of hot weather. There were 243 more deaths in England between 18 and 19 April than the five-year average across the same period, but 378 fewer between 21 and 23 April. The ONS quarterly report covers deaths registered in England between April and June. Overall, there were 108,537 deaths in England during the three-month period - 497 fewer than the five-year average. The next release, expected in December, will examine in detail those that might be attributable to the 2018 heatwave.

"French and UK boats collided in the channel when the row broke out in August British and French fishermen have reached a deal to end the scrap over scallops in the English Channel. The agreement, starting on Tuesday, will see larger British boats withdrawing in return for greater fishing rights elsewhere. In August, boats collided and fishermen threw stones at each other as the French accused UK boats of depleting scallop stocks. British fishermen said they were legally entitled to fish there. Under the terms of the new deal, UK scallop dredgers over 15m long will leave the scallop beds off the coast of Normandy from midnight for six weeks. In return, France will transfer fishing rights for scallops in areas such as the Irish Sea. Smaller British boats are not restricted under the deal and can continue to fish in the Bay of Seine, where the row broke out. Fisheries minister George Eustice said: ""I commend the UK fishing industry for its patience throughout negotiations and welcome this pragmatic outcome."" Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? There have been tensions over scallop supplies in the area for 15 years. French rules prevent scallop fishing between 15 May and 1 October - allowing stocks to recover in the spawning season - but British boats can fish year-round. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? Over the past five years a deal kept the peace, with larger British boats staying out of the area in return for more fishing rights elsewhere. That deal lapsed, but when UK boats returned overnight on August 27 they were met by around 40 French craft and pelted with rocks. French police said both sides threw missiles. The action was condemned by Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, as ""high seas piracy"". About 1,350 jobs depend on the Â£120m UK scallop industry. About 60% of the catch is exported - with much of it being bought by the French. But experts warned in 2016 that the fishing effort by France, the UK, Belgium and Ireland in the Bay of Seine was depleting stocks too fast. An earlier attempt to broker a deal was scuppered. The UK and France had tried to reach an agreement which would see all British boats staying out of the disputed territory during the French no-fishing period. But the parties could not agree on the compensation package for British boats, which had been free to harvest scallops there throughout the year. Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops?

"About 1,000 workers at Jaguar's Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham will move from a five-day to a three-day week from October until Christmas. Jaguar Land Rover said it was making ""temporary adjustments to our production schedules"" at the factory. It was standard practice to ""regularly review its production schedules to ensure market demand is balanced globally"", JLR added. It affects about half the plant's 2,000 workers, who will remain on full pay. The move means production of Jaguar cars will slow - many of which have diesel engines. Diesel sales have sunk as buyers question their environmental impact. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP for Erdington, blamed ""Brexit chaos and the mishandling by ministers of the transition from diesel"" for the three-day week. He told the BBC the government had sent ""the message that somehow if you buy a diesel car, they'll be worthless, in circumstances where actually the new generation diesels are ultra low emission produced by the company. So there's been a real problem there."" Despite the ""continuing headwinds"" affecting the car industry, JLR said it was committed to its UK plants, ""in which we have invested more than Â£4bn since 2010 to future-proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models"". As well as Castle Bromwich, JLR also has plants in Halewood and Solihull. Assistant general secretary of the Unite union, Tony Burke, pointed the blame at Theresa May. ""This is the continuing effect of the chaotic mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations by the government, which has created uncertainty across the UK's automotive industry and the manufacturing sector generally,"" he said. Last week, JLR boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" orrisk big job cuts at the carmakerand wiping out its profits. The production cutbacks come on the day that Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP and Brexit supporter, accused Mr Speth of scaremongering with his predictions. ""I'm afraid I think he's making it up. We've had figures made up all the time by the scaremongers in this debate and I'm afraid nobody believes them,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Sir Bernard's comments were described as ""embarrassing"" by pro-Remain Tory backbencher Anna Soubry. The company said in April it would not renew the contracts of 1,000 temporary workers at two factories. JLR is owned by India's Tata Motors and employs 40,000 people directly, with another 260,000 working in its supply chain. In July, Jaguar Land Rover warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal wouldthreaten Â£80bn worth of investmentplans for the UK and could force it to close factories. Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, a fifth of which were sold to mainland Europe.

"Coca-Cola is best known for its eponymous caffeine-based drink, but the firm now appears to be experimenting with a different drug: cannabis. According to Canada's BNN Bloomberg,external, the drinks giant is in talks with local producer Aurora Cannabis about developing marijuana-infused beverages. These would not aim to intoxicate consumers but to relieve pain. The firm declined to comment but said it was watching the cannabis drinks market closely. ""Along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive cannabidiol as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,""Coca-Cola said in a statement.,external Corona beer firm pours $4bn into weed Cannabis debate: What you need to know Cannabidiol, a constituent of cannabis, can help ease inflammation, pain and cramping, but has no psychoactive effect. It comes as Canada prepares to follow certain US states in legalising cannabis for recreational use, after years of permitting it for medicinal purposes. It has given rise to a large pot growing industry and some high-profile partnerships. Earlier this year, beer giant Molson Coors Brewing said it would make cannabis-infused drinks with Hydropothecary, while Corona-beer maker Constellation Brands invested $4bn more into pot firm Canopy Growth. A partnership between Coke and Aurora would mark the first entry of a major manufacturer of non-alcoholic drinks into the market. Quoting unnamed sources, BNN Bloomberg said Coca-Cola was in ""serious talks"" with Aurora but no deal had been finalised. ""They're pretty advanced down the path"" of doing a deal, one source was quoted as saying. ""It's going to be more of the 'recovery drink' category,"" the source added. Aurora, in a separate statement, said it would not discuss business development initiatives until they were finalised, but added: ""Aurora has expressed specific interest in the infused beverage space, and we intend to enter that market.""

"This video can not be played Hundreds rescued in deadly Florence floods As flooding continues to inundate North Carolina, the death toll from Florence has risen to at least 32, with 25 deaths confirmed in North Carolina. The state's governor, Roy Cooper, said on Monday that the ""epic storm"" was still an immediate danger as rivers reach major flood levels. The coastal city of Wilmington became an island amid heavy floods following the storm. Officials have warned evacuated residents to stay away. Wilmington grapples with Florence aftermath At a news conference on Monday, Gov Cooper said ""catastrophic flooding and tornados are still claiming lives and property"" across the state. ""For many parts of North Carolina the danger is still immediate,"" he said. ""Some areas have not seen the worst flooding yet. This is a monumental disaster for our state."" An initial estimate from Moody's Analytics puts the cost of Florence between $17bn (Â£13bn) and $22bn, making the storm one of the 10 costliest hurricanes in US history,according to NPR,external. Most of the monetary damage is due to property loss, and the company said these figures could rise as inland flooding continues. The Waffle House chain remained open in the marooned city - whether a town's Waffle House is open is one of the indicators FEMA uses to determine the scale of a disaster In Wilmington, with its population of about 120,000, some 400 people have had to be rescued from flood waters, and most of the city remains without power. The governor said that 23 truckloads of supplies were able to make it into Wilmington this morning, though officials are uncertain whether the single road into the city will remain functional as rivers continue to flood. The National Weather Service has warned of at least two further days of possible flash flooding in the area before conditions are forecast to improve. ""Do not come here,"" New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White said. ""We want you home, but you can't come yet."" A city-wide curfew has been extended after five people were arrested on suspicion of looting from a store on Saturday. The area is usually best known as a filming location for US dramas One Tree Hill and Dawson's Creek, and as the childhood home of US basketball legend Michael Jordan. Florence has now weakened to a tropical depression with winds of 30mph (45km/h), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Some parts of the Carolinas have seen up to 40in (100cm) of rain since Thursday. On Monday, the National Weather Service announced that the Cape Fear River near Fayetteville, North Carolina, is expected to reach the major flood stage - levels over 60ft (18m) - by this evening.

Power companies are working to restore power to the nearly half a million homes and businesses in both states that are still without electricity. The storm has begun to move into Virginia and West Virginia, and is expected to turn toward New England on Tuesday. On Monday, police in Union County, North Carolina, recovered the body of a one-year-old boy who had been swept away by floodwaters. The boy's mother had driven around a barricade in the road and ended up stalled in rushing water. As she tried to leave the car, she lost grip of the boy and he was carried off in the floods, theNews & Observer,externalreported. An 88-year-old man was also found dead in Union County on Monday, next to a car that had been submerged in the floods. Among the other fatalities were two men in their 70s who died in Lenoir County - one had been connecting extension cords and another was blown by high winds when checking on his dogs. Four road deaths in South Carolina have been blamed on the storm, and two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

"This video can not be played Theresa May told Panorama: 'I think that the alternative to that (the Chequers plan) will be not having a deal' Theresa May has told the BBC that MPs will have a choice between her proposed deal with the EU - or no deal at all. She was also critical of a plan by Brexiteers to resolve the Irish border issue, saying it would create a ""hard border 20km inside Ireland"". The prime minister did admit that under ""no-deal there would be some short-term disruption"". Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said no-deal would be ""catastrophic"" and people were ""too casual about it"". He told Panorama: ""It's not viable. It's rhetoric, not reality, and it can't be allowed to happen."" But Mrs May said it was the government's job to ""make sure we make a success of no-deal, just as we make a success of getting a good deal."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Under no deal there would be some short-term disruption"" Her comments were in response to questioning about theBank of England's governor Mark Carney's warningthat a no-deal Brexit could see house prices crash by more than a third. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fundhas saidthe UK economy will shrink without a Brexit deal. In its annual assessment of the UK economy, the IMF said that all likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"", but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government had to listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"". Brexit: All you need to know Chequers plan 'will avoid hard border' May 'irritated' by leadership speculation Reality Check: The UK's Brexit preparations The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations between the two sides are still taking place. Mrs May set out her proposals for the key issue of cross-border trade after a Chequers summit in July, but it has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers who say plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Speaking to Panorama, Mrs May said that if Parliament does not ratify the Chequers plan ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Theresa May calculated that faced with a ""binary choice"" of the Chequers deal or no deal, Brexiteers would not have the ""chutzpah to say 'no way'"" and Remainers would decide that carrying on fighting the plan would be too risky. But the risks are that the PM cannot say for certain what the final deal will look like - and some Brexiteers were already determined not to vote for it, she added. The Panorama documentary features Theresa May and husband Philip watching ITV show The Chase at Chequers Mr Johnson's column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalrenewed his attack on the Chequers proposals and the government's plans for avoiding new border checks on the Northern Irish border. He criticised the UK's decision to agree with the EU on the need for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border irrespective of a trade deal, saying the issue was being used ""to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels"". Downing Street responded by saying Mr Johnson had been part of the government that signed up to the backstop plan. In her Panorama interview, Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. Last week a group of Brexiteer Tory MPs said a hard border could be avoided by using ""established"" technology and ""modifying"" existing arrangements. Mr Johnson refers to the suggestions by the European Research Group in his column, saying that ""extra checks done away from the border"" would prevent the need for physical checks when vehicles move between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Theresa May hits back at Boris Johnson over Chequers plan But Mrs May insisted that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"". ""You don't solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland,"" she said. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""insult to the intelligence of British voters"" for the prime minister to say it was a ""choice between either the Chequers fudge or a cataclysmic cliff edge"". Speaking later at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton,Sir Nick claimedEuropean leaders were ""seeking to find some way of giving Britain more time"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC the prime minister should ""try a bit harder"" to get a better deal. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May has found herself embattled with some in her party, after about 50 European Research Group Tory MPs openly discussed how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister. On Sunday Brexit-supporting Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the Chequers plan was the right one ""for now"". He told the BBC a future prime minister could alter the relationship between the UK and the EU. Mrs May will attempt to persuade EU leaders of the merits of her plans at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday. With nearly six months to go until exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, a poll commissioned by BBC Radio 5 Live suggests that the UK remains split over whether Brexit will be positive for the UK. According to a Comres survey, 50% of British adults feel the overall impact will be negative, whereas 41% think it will be positive. When asked about the handling of Brexit negotiations, almost 79% of people polled thought that the government had handled them badly, and 63% thought the EU had handled them badly. The People's Vote campaign, meanwhile, claimed a ""fresh wave"" of 18-year-olds becoming eligible to vote was ""transforming the dynamics of the Brexit debate"" because they mostly back staying in the EU.

"Last December, Christine Lagarde was in a more positive mood. Globally, economies were growing at a ""reasonable"" pace. Recent progress on the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the rest of the European Union were ""welcome"". Both sides had just agreed the outline of the withdrawal agreement and divorce bill. Nine months on and todaya much bleaker assessment from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and its managing director. The challenges on Brexit were ""daunting"", the IMF said. A ""no deal"" would have a significant and negative shock effect on the UK economy. And any Brexit deal, Chequers or otherwise, was also likely to mean a smaller economy in the future. There was still no solution to the Ireland border question. An economic ""Brexit dividend' - relied on by Theresa May to pay for at least some of the extra funding promised for the NHS - was unlikely to arrive quickly enough. Brexit: Where has the process got to? Brexit: All you need to know Yes, exports had been boosted by the fall in the value of sterling after the referendum, but not by enough to offset other negative effects. And such was the level of uncertainty around the Brexit process there was even a warning for the Bank of England on interest rates. ""Further withdrawal of monetary stimulus should await clear confirmation of a durable rise in domestic cost pressures,"" the IMF said. Which, in plainer language, means don't increase interest rates until it is crystal clear that inflation - prices - are going up too strongly for the economy to cope. The IMF says the challenges of Brexit are ""daunting"" Before Ms Lagarde made her speech this morning, Philip Hammond made a short statement. ""We must heed the warnings of the IMF about not reaching a deal,"" he said. The chancellor is clear. His political colleagues, he believes, need to focus on the economic effects of a ""no deal"" as outlined today by the IMF. And not flirt with the idea that, somehow, it might not have the negative economic effects outlined today. ""No-one voted to be poorer,"" he said last year. The Treasury believes the IMF's analysis is correct. A ""no deal"" would carry significant economic costs.

"The Duchess of Sussex has launched her first solo project as a royal - a cookbook in support of Grenfell families and others. Meghan has written the foreword to a recipe book produced by cooks at the Hubb Community Kitchen, based near the tower in west London. The duchess has been working with volunteers there since January. She said she felt ""connected"" to the project as ""a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together."" The book, called 'Together: Our Community Cookbook', includes 50 recipes by women whose community was affected by the tower block fire in June 2017, which killed 72 people. Among the cooks the duchess worked with on private visits to the Hubb were two survivors of the blaze. Hiwot Dagnachew helped to save the lives of her niece, Meron Mekonnen, and Ms Mekonnen's two children by calling them to warn of the fire. ""We were fast asleep and my phone rang - I'm so lucky it wasn't on silent,"" Ms Mekonnentold The Telegraph.,external And Munira Mahmud was instrumental in founding the community kitchen, based at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, because she had nowhere to prepare food after losing her home in the fire. The duchess described her as the ""chef de cuisine"" and recounted how on her first visit Ms Mahmud put her in an apron and made her wash rice. Hiwot Dagnachew (far left) and Munira Mahmud (far right) were among the Grenfell survivors who worked with the duchess The idea for a fundraising book came when the cooks told the duchess the kitchen could only open twice a week, prompting her to ask: ""How about sharing your recipes with other people?"" They hope the proceeds will allow the Hubb - named after the Arabic word for love - to support Grenfell families and others in the community seven days a week. Meghan has been working with the community kitchen since January The duchess helped the group find a publisher, while the Royal Foundation - a charity set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - provided legal and administrative back-up. In her foreword, she said that the Hubb brought cultures together under one roof and allowed people to enjoy ""the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy"". ""Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive,"" the duchess said. Two of the cooks, Intlak Al Saiegh and Ahlam Saeid, show off their work Family recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean are featured in the book. In their introduction, the women said: ""Our kitchen has always been a place of good food, love, support and friendship. ""We cook the recipes we've grown up with; there's no stress, and the recipes always work because they have been made so many times - it's proper comfort food."" The Royal Foundation will administer the transfer of the proceeds from the sale of the book to the Hubb Community Kitchen and related projects.

"This video can not be played Christine Lagarde has warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would entail ""substantial costs"" for the UK economy The International Monetary Fund has warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit on World Trade Organization terms would entail ""substantial costs"" for the UK economy. The IMF said thatall likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"",external, but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"". The challenges in getting a deal done remained ""daunting"", it said. The IMF expects Britain's economy to grow by 1.5% in both 2018 and 2019 if a broad Brexit agreement is struck. The predictions came in the IMF's latest annual assessment of the UK economy. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, told a news conference at the Treasury in London: ""Those projections assume a timely deal with the EU on a broad free trade agreement and a relatively orderly Brexit process after that. ""Any deal will not be as good as the smooth process under which goods, services, people and capital move around between the EU and the UK without impediments and obstacles."" Brexit: Where has the process got to? Brexit: All you need to know The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the government must listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"". He added: ""The IMF are clear today that no deal would be extremely costly for the UK as it would also for the EU, and that despite the contingency actions we're taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the past 10 years in repairing our economy."" Theresa May phones EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker The IMF warning comes as Theresa May told the BBC thatMPs must choose between her proposed deal with the EU - or no deal at all. Speaking to Panorama, the prime minister said that if Parliament does not ratify her Chequers plan, ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"". Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland to avoid a hard border there. A plan by Brexiteers to resolve the Irish border issue also came in for criticism from the prime minister, who said it would create a ""hard border 20km inside Ireland"". Please upgrade your browser The IMF's Ms Lagarde said a ""disorderly"" or ""crash"" exit from the EU would have a series of consequences, including reduced growth, an increased deficit and depreciation of sterling, causing the UK economy to contract. The IMF also said a no-deal outcome would affect other EU economies ""to a lesser extent"". ""The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""This should be fairly obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not."" She pointed out that countries tended to trade mostly with their neighbours: ""I think geography talks very loudly."" Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Comparing this year's IMF analysis and Ms Lagarde's words with last December and there is a significant cooling of sentiment around the effects of Brexit. The IMF is signalling that, with just over six months to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, the very fact that ""no deal"" remains on the table is of economic concern. When asked if she could see any ""positives"" coming from Brexit, Ms Lagarde repeated the long list of possible negatives. ""No,"" seemed to be her answer. Read Kamal's blog in full Ms Lagarde said she ""very much"" hoped that the UK and the EU would strike a deal, describing herself as ""a desperate optimist"". Recent UK economic data has shown a pick-up in growth. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics saidthe economy had grown by 0.6% over the three months to July- the fastest pace in almost a year. The latest IMF prediction represents a slight upgrade for 2018. In July, the IMF said the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2019.

"One of the top shareholders in Unilever has said it will vote against the firm's plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands, amid growing investor concern about the plan. Aviva Investors told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, is relocating to simplify its corporate structure. It needs 75% of shareholder votes to get the plan through. Marmite maker Unilever goes Dutch for HQ Why is Unilever scrapping its London HQ? Unilever has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. The company is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index with a market value of about Â£124bn. However, under UK rules it would no longer be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 in London after the proposed change. Shareholders fear this would cause a rush for the exits to sell the stock, leading to losses. Dove is one of Unilever's major brands David Cumming, chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Aside from the fact it is disappointing to see a world-class company like Unilever leave the UK, it also means longstanding UK shareholders may be forced to sell their stock. ""I don't see logically why any UK shareholder would support their decision to go Dutch, because there is no upside only downside."" Some have speculated Unilever is making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denies. Mr Cummings said he believed the company is also seeking ""protection"" aftera failed takeover attempt by US food giant Kraft Heinzin 2017. According tothe Financial Times,external, more than a fifth of Unilever's top 50 shareholders have expressed concerns privately about the relocation. Another institutional shareholder, Lindsell Train, echoed Mr Cumming's concerns about becoming a forced seller ""at a time and price not of our choosing"". Lindsell Train held a 2.5% stake in the company as of July, while Aviva holds 1.4%. Other shareholders include BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and Leverhulme, both of which hold more than 5%. A Unilever spokesman said the company was confident it would win the approval of shareholders: ""We have engaged extensively with our shareholders and we believe the vast majority are fully supportive of the board's proposal.""

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut left a trail of devastation in the Philippines Rescuers in the Philippines are digging through mud to retrieve bodies buried by a landslide that hit as Typhoon Mangkhut battered the country. At least 32 people in the mining town of Itogon, in Benguet province, were crushed in a single shelter. Teams are raking through the rubble with their bare hands, passing blocks of concrete and pieces of wood down a 50ft line to clear the area. Typhoon Mangkhut is now weakening over southern China. Four people were killed in the province of Guangdong - three by falling trees. The storm ploughed across the main Philippine island of Luzon over the weekend. More than 60 people have been killed, mostly in landslides triggered by heavy rains, with the majority in Benguet province. A group of artisanal goldminers in the village of Ucab, which lies in a valley in Itogon municipality, had huddled with their families in a two-storey shelter, Conrad Navidad of the International Organization for Migration told the BBC. The building was crushed, and 29 people remain missing. ""It was used as a worship area for the church group of the mine workers and their families,"" said Mr Navidad, who was at the scene earlier on Monday. ""Before the typhoon hit, their pastor invited them to take refuge in that bunkhouse - and then the disaster happened and they were buried by the landslide. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines 'We are cowering in fear' ""They are not hoping for survivors anymore - just for the retrieval of the bodies buried."" The Chamber of Mines of the Philippines said mining operators had been told to leave, but that a mine near the shelter had been operating illegally. The Philippine government on Monday said it was deploying security forces to put a stop to illegal small-scale mining in the vast Cordillera mountain region, a practice which is credited with increasing the likelihood of landslides in communities like Itogon. Relatives of those caught in the landslide wait as rescuers dig for bodies The BBC's Howard Johnson, who has been covering the storm, described a trail of destruction along the northern coast of Luzon, with forests ripped to shreds and electricity poles felled. There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. How to survive a monster storm What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong Preparation and evacuation procedures have nonetheless improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools closed, and the army was put on standby in advance. Typhoon Mangkhut is one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in decades.It made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon. It is now weakening as it makes its way across southern China and has been downgraded to a tropical storm. More than 2.5 million people have been evacuated in Guangdong and on Hainan island. People caught outside as the worst of the storm approached were overwhelmed by conditions In Hong Kong, which was hit hard over the weekend, videos on social media showed apartments swaying in the wind, scaffolding crashing to the ground and commercial buildings with windows shattered. Transport services were suspended, with flights cancelled, trains stopped, and major roads closed. Officials put the number of injured at more than 200. The city managed to avoid serious casualties but now faces a difficult recovery as thousands remain affected by flooding and travel disruptions. Allow Twitter content?

"Around 500 people will be eligible for treatment with the new combination drug therapy Hundreds of patients with a type of aggressive skin cancer will be offered a targeted therapy on the NHS in England and Wales, which reduces the risk of it returning. At present, they have to hope their cancer will not return after surgery. The drug has been shown to improve the survival of people with stage III melanoma, with a particular mutation. A skin cancer charity said making the treatment available on the NHS was ""a huge step forward"". Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, with 15,400 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. A gene mutation called BRAF is found in approximately half of cases - and around 500 of those people have stage III. This means that cancer cells have spread into skin, lymph vessels or lymph glands close to the melanoma, but they haven't spread to more distant parts of the body. The therapy, which has beenapproved by the health body NICE,external- the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - is a combination of the drugs dabrafenib and trametinib which can be taken at home as five tablets a day. It comes after a clinical trial of more than 800 patients found a lower risk of the cancer recurring in a group taking the therapy. Three years after surgery, 58% of this group survived with no relapse compared to 39% of the placebo group. The therapy was also found to increase the overall length of time people live, by reducing how many people develop an incurable form of the disease. However there were side effects, including fatigue and nausea, that occurred in a third of patients taking the therapy, and 10% of the placebo group. Gill Nuttall, from charity Melanoma UK, said: ""We are continuing to see an increase in the number of people in the UK with melanoma, especially among younger people. ""The availability of this treatment is a huge step forward for the hundreds of BRAF-positive patients who are currently left with very few options following surgery. ""The current 'watch and wait' approach is an extremely worrying and stressful time for patients and their families."" Melanoma accounts for more deaths than all other skin cancers, with around 2,400 in the UK every year. Mirella Marlow, deputy director for the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said there were currently no treatments available for people with this stage and type of melanoma to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. She said the decision marked ""an important development in the management of melanoma"". Professor Ruth Plummer, clinical professor of experimental cancer medicine, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, said the treatment had ""the potential to transform the standard of care for people with BRAF-positive stage III melanoma"".

"This video can not be played Almost nine out of 10 drivers say they have been tailgated on England's roads A campaign has been launched to stop drivers on England's roads from tailgating - said to be one of the biggest bugbears for motorists. More than 100 people are killed or seriously hurt each year in crashes caused by driving too closely to other vehicles, Highways England says. And almost nine out of 10 drivers say they have been tailgated, with some left feeling ""victimised"". Drivers are advised to allow a two-second gap between vehicles. More than 100 people are killed or seriously hurt each year in crashes caused by tailgating, Highways England says Ahead of the launch of its ""Don't Be A Space Invader"" campaign, Highways England surveyed 1,109 motorists and found that one in four had tailgated another driver in the last three months. ""It makes the driver in front feel targeted and victimised, distracting their attention from the road ahead and making them more likely to make a mistake,"" Richard Leonard, head of road safety at Highways England, said. In-car research using dashcams, facial recognition and heart monitors revealed reactions to tailgating included surprise, anger and contempt. It was identified as the biggest single bugbear that drivers have about other road users. Stackable 'cars of the future' unveiled Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? Tailgating caused one in eight casualties in 2016 on motorways and A-roads in England,external, government statistics show. Former Formula 1 world champion Nigel Mansell is backing the campaign, describing tailgating as ""a driving habit I utterly deplore"". ""Not only is it aggressive and intimidating, but there is absolutely no upside to it,"" he said. ""You will not get to your destination faster, you are not a skilled driver for doing it, and you are putting so many innocent people at risk"". Figures obtained by the BBC in 2014 showed thatthousands of motorists had been fined for hogging lanes and tailgating.

"It's felt like a long time to get this far. Decades of debate about our place in the EU. Years of push me, pull you debates on the right, about whether there should be a referendum on our membership of the European Union. The crashing highs and lows, and lows and highs of the referendum campaign itself. And since then, more than 18 months of the Brexit process squeezing the life out of almost everything else in our politics - still a subject of huge division, of frustration, of thrill and excitement, of concern and fascination and question marks. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, says May Reality Check: How are Brexit preparations getting on? Much of 'Brexit' is mind-numbing to many in its complexity and level of detail. Some of the political game-playing is tedious soap opera to all but a precious few. The parliamentary process is vital but labyrinthine. The layers upon layers of party divisions are ever shifting, and hard to track. But what looks like a series of individual clashes, or indeed occasionally a shambles, matters. Because the eventual decisions that will and are being made in all of our names are a product of all of those tangles, and they will affect our livelihoods and the place of the country in the world for many years to come. Please upgrade your browser With six months to go, and a critical meeting of EU leaders later this week, where the UK hopes to move into the next phase, it's worth taking a breath and reflecting, in a way that's not exhaustive,  on where this process has got to. The most likely outcome right now is that a deal between the UK and the EU will be done in November. If that happens it will be made up of a legally binding withdrawal agreement - that contains the cash, what happens to citizens on both sides, and in theory, a solution for Northern Ireland. Alongside that will be the document that in theory shapes the future of the relationship for good - the political declaration. However, as we joked at the beginning of the process that the deal was likely in the end to be a fudge, so it seems that could come to pass. Behind the scenes diplomats and politicians are starting to talk about the declaration being vague, in order that trickiest issues don't have to be resolved yet. A senior cabinet minister told me last week, 'ambiguity might be the way out'. Michael Gove even suggested publicly on Sunday that this year's deal doesn't have to be the end of the story. One diplomat told me that a vague deal might be the way through but that means Brexit would then essentially go on for years - 'If the vagueness is the solution then at the end we start again'. This set of Brexit talks would conclude, only for years of a next phase to begin. But this is becoming known as 'blind Brexit', and while it is a possible way out of the talks it has obvious problems. One MP joked that we might end up with an 'agreement of adjectives'. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The most pressing argument against a vague deal is concern over the Irish border. Again in his column in the Daily Telegraph, the former foreign secretary expresses his frustration with how that question has become such a central issue in the talks. But frankly, it's been the blindingly obvious case for many months, that without a convincing arrangement coming from the UK side, the EU will find it extremely difficult to do the deal, without forcing their backstop. There's talk in negotiation circles of 'backstop 2', there's talk of a way of softening the language around the EU's position. And, of course, Brexiteers are trying hard to force Theresa May to put a different set of arrangements on the table. There is, however, no chance of her shifting, at least not until after the end of the Conservative conference. Her Chequers agreement where officials and ministers drafted a way through the EU and UK red lines is her plan for now and she isn't budging until she is forced to. Without going through the arguments as we have discussed many times here, her Chequers deal is one of the reasons why her job is at risk. Since the election, her handling of Brexit has made her vulnerable to circling rivals in the Tory party. Her advocates believe she has displayed extraordinary resilience holding on so far. But there is a sense of foreboding around the place. More and more MPs are willing to say publicly that after Brexit her time is limited. One senior MP suggested to me that if those close to the Prime Minister aren't telling her that then they are in fact doing her a disservice. The Tories have been lucky though in one sense. An opposition party that was less distracted by its own woes could be tearing strips off the government daily. As it is, with Labour's own problems so clearly on display, the government is in a less precarious position than you might expect. But they are vulnerable, enormously vulnerable, in the next couple of months. Assuming that there is a deal of some sorts (if it is possible to assume anything), the government is not certain to be able to get the vote through the House of Commons. Government insiders believe the vote will get through, that most MPs will choose the relative stability of a deal, rather than take the risk. One Tory MP even said last week, 'any deal is better than no deal'. But, and it is a big but, Tory hard core eurosceptics might join with the opposition parties to bring the deal down. They really might.  If that happens there is no map and no precedent. Those campaigning vigorously for a second referendum believe that could be their opportunity to push for a second vote. The Labour  Party hope that would bring a general election giving them an opportunity to win. A vote could sink Theresa May, or even re-open the referendum. The bumps of the last two years could be nothing in comparison to that.

"One of the top shareholders in Unilever has said it will vote against the firm's plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands, amid growing investor concern about the plan. Aviva Investors told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, is relocating to simplify its corporate structure. It needs 75% of shareholder votes to get the plan through. Marmite maker Unilever goes Dutch for HQ Why is Unilever scrapping its London HQ? Unilever has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. The company is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index with a market value of about Â£124bn. However, under UK rules it would no longer be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 in London after the proposed change. Shareholders fear this would cause a rush for the exits to sell the stock, leading to losses. Dove is one of Unilever's major brands David Cumming, chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Aside from the fact it is disappointing to see a world-class company like Unilever leave the UK, it also means longstanding UK shareholders may be forced to sell their stock. ""I don't see logically why any UK shareholder would support their decision to go Dutch, because there is no upside only downside."" Some have speculated Unilever is making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denies. Mr Cummings said he believed the company is also seeking ""protection"" aftera failed takeover attempt by US food giant Kraft Heinzin 2017. According tothe Financial Times,external, more than a fifth of Unilever's top 50 shareholders have expressed concerns privately about the relocation. Another institutional shareholder, Lindsell Train, echoed Mr Cumming's concerns about becoming a forced seller ""at a time and price not of our choosing"". Lindsell Train held a 2.5% stake in the company as of July, while Aviva holds 1.4%. Other shareholders include BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and Leverhulme, both of which hold more than 5%. A Unilever spokesman said the company was confident it would win the approval of shareholders: ""We have engaged extensively with our shareholders and we believe the vast majority are fully supportive of the board's proposal.""

"Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh say they are both willing to testify Lawmakers from both sides of the US political divide have called for a delay in the vote on the nominee for the powerful Supreme Court. It follows an allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s against President Donald Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Kavanaugh denies the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.

Prof Ford spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory, she said, prompting her to approach Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete. The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate. Senator Jeff Flake has clashed with Donald Trump previously The Republicans only have a single-vote majority on the committee, which they control 11 to 10, while they hold the Senate by just 51-49. Mr Kavanaughis strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views on issues such as abortion, and it seems unlikely any of them will cross the aisle to vote with their Republican colleagues. This means it would take just Mr Flake to potentially derail Thursday's committee vote, while only two Republican defections would swing the outcome away from Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher.

"The g-force pushed blood into Tyler's head which caused him to pass out, his mum said A teenager has been quizzed by police after a ""stupid"" YouTube stunt in which a boy was spun at high speed on a park roundabout using the wheel of a moped. Tyler Broome was left with ""horrific injuries""similar to those inflicted by high levels of g-force, his mother said she was told by doctors. The 11-year-old passed out and was abandoned by those involved, she said. Nottinghamshire Police said a 16-year-old was interviewed under caution and a moped has been seized. More stories from the East Midlands The teenager was questioned about his involvement over what happened at Ashvale Park, in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, on Wednesday. Dawn Hollingworth released a video of son Tyler, which shows him spread-eagled across the top of the roundabout as it spins around. At the end of the recording, Tyler appears to fall down, his head flopping forward as it comes to a stop. Tyler was left with facial bruising but the consequences could have been far worse, doctors said Blood rushed to his head, causing swelling and bruising to his face, she said. The 51-year-old said doctors told her Tyler's injuries were usually seen in fighter pilots suffering the effects of g-force. Ch Insp Andy Rooke said: ""What may have seemed like 'a bit of fun' at the time has turned into an incident where an 11-year old boy has received horrific injuries. ""We hope that this incident and the severity of the boy's injuries serve as a strong warning to anyone thinking about recreating something they have seen online.""

"The Duchess of Sussex has launched her first solo project as a royal - a cookbook in support of Grenfell families and others. Meghan has written the foreword to a recipe book produced by cooks at the Hubb Community Kitchen, based near the tower in west London. The duchess has been working with volunteers there since January. She said she felt ""connected"" to the project as ""a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together."" The book, called 'Together: Our Community Cookbook', includes 50 recipes by women whose community was affected by the tower block fire in June 2017, which killed 72 people. Among the cooks the duchess worked with on private visits to the Hubb were two survivors of the blaze. Hiwot Dagnachew helped to save the lives of her niece, Meron Mekonnen, and Ms Mekonnen's two children by calling them to warn of the fire. ""We were fast asleep and my phone rang - I'm so lucky it wasn't on silent,"" Ms Mekonnentold The Telegraph.,external And Munira Mahmud was instrumental in founding the community kitchen, based at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, because she had nowhere to prepare food after losing her home in the fire. The duchess described her as the ""chef de cuisine"" and recounted how on her first visit Ms Mahmud put her in an apron and made her wash rice. Hiwot Dagnachew (far left) and Munira Mahmud (far right) were among the Grenfell survivors who worked with the duchess The idea for a fundraising book came when the cooks told the duchess the kitchen could only open twice a week, prompting her to ask: ""How about sharing your recipes with other people?"" They hope the proceeds will allow the Hubb - named after the Arabic word for love - to support Grenfell families and others in the community seven days a week. Meghan has been working with the community kitchen since January The duchess helped the group find a publisher, while the Royal Foundation - a charity set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - provided legal and administrative back-up. In her foreword, she said that the Hubb brought cultures together under one roof and allowed people to enjoy ""the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy"". ""Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive,"" the duchess said. Two of the cooks, Intlak Al Saiegh and Ahlam Saeid, show off their work Family recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean are featured in the book. In their introduction, the women said: ""Our kitchen has always been a place of good food, love, support and friendship. ""We cook the recipes we've grown up with; there's no stress, and the recipes always work because they have been made so many times - it's proper comfort food."" The Royal Foundation will administer the transfer of the proceeds from the sale of the book to the Hubb Community Kitchen and related projects.

"Brett Kavanaugh denies the allegations A woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted by US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has identified herself. Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post Mr Kavanaugh had pinned her to a bed and tried to undress her when they were both teenagers. Mr Kavanaugh denied the allegations when they first surfaced last week. The top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are now expected to speak to both Mr Kavanaugh and Mrs Ford. Mrs Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University,told the Post she had decided to go public,externalas her privacy was ""being chipped away"". She said she first approached Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July, shortly after Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory. If chosen for the lifetime appointment, Mr Kavanaugh would be expected to tilt the Supreme Court's balance to the right. The conservative appeals court judgeis strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views, such as on abortion. Mrs Ford said she believed the incident happened in 1982, when she was 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was 17. He was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland, and she was studying at a nearby high school. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations The incident allegedly happened at a gathering of teenagers at a house, when Mr Kavanaugh and a friend allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom. Mr Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk, she says. In the words of the Washington Post, ""While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. ""When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."" Mrs Ford, 51, is further quoted as saying that she managed to break free. ""I thought he [Mr Kavanaugh] might inadvertently kill me,"" she told the Post. Mr Kavanaugh issued his denial last week: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time"". Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room,told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"",external. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete. The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said to push through a vote then would be an ""insult"" to American women. Five takeaways from the Kavanaugh hearings Trump Supreme Court pick under microscope Listen: Who is Judge Brett Kavanaugh? Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the committee, has also said he is ""not comfortable voting yes"" should no attempt be made to hear Mrs Ford's story. Republicans have a single-vote majority on the committee, 11 to 10. ""We need to hear from her,"" he told website Politico,external. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this."" Two other Republican senators have also expressed concerns: Bob Corker, who said the vote should be delayed until the Mrs Ford is heard, andLisa Murkowski, who told CNN a delay was something ""they might have to consider"",external. Neither sit on the committee, but Republicans can ill afford any defections in the full Senate if they want Mr Kavanaugh confirmed, as they hold a slim 51-49 majority. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee's Republican chairman, said he was ""actively working"" to set up bipartisan calls to both people as a result of the revelations. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's glide path to the Supreme Court has been interrupted. That doesn't mean, however, his nomination is destined to crash and burn. The allegations about an incident that happened when the judge was a teenager, more than 30 years ago, will be difficult to prove with any degree of certainty. While Christine Blasey Ford offers corroborating evidence for her claims, the accusations won't be adjudicated in a court of law or even the court of public opinion. The only thing that matters when it comes to Mr Kavanaugh's professional fate is whether there are at least two Republicans in the Senate willing to side with Democrats and block the judge's confirmation. All eyes will be on Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two considered most likely to break ranks. This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher. Mrs Ford says she sent a letter to her local congresswoman, Democrat Anna Eshoo, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat. Mrs Ford says she believes Ms Feinstein honoured her request to keep the letter confidential, but ""others did not"". This video can not be played Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh: ""I'm a team player"" Ms Feinstein said in a statement after seeing the Washington Post article: ""I support Mrs Ford's decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee."" Senator Grassley issued a statement defending Mr Kavanaugh. ""Judge Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI full-field investigations from 1993 to 2018,"" he said. ""No such allegation resembling the anonymous claims ever surfaced.""

"""Inescapable"" costs, like childcare and disability, should be considered alongside income when measuring poverty in the UK, experts say. The Social Metrics Commission says the proposals make ""significant changes to our understanding"" of poverty. The measurement puts 68% of those in families where no-one works in poverty and 9% in families where adults work full-time. The government said it offered ""further insight"" into a ""complex"" issue. It currently measures poverty by looking at a person's income compared with the rest of the country, and compares present incomes with salaries earlier in the decade to see how they have changed over time. Reality Check: What does 'poor' really mean? More children and pensioners in poverty Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food' The SMC says as well as costs, the new measure takes into account the positive impact of access to liquid assets, such as savings. It also takes steps to include groups of people who have been left out of poverty statistics before, such as those living on the streets or in overcrowded housing. The organisation has developed the measure over the last two-and-a-half years. Chair of the SMC, Baroness Philippa Stroud, said groups needed to come together when looking at how to measure poverty. ""The need for an independent commission was clear,"" she said. ""For too long it has been possible to have a debate about the measurement of poverty. ""Now I call on people and organisations across, and outside of, the political spectrum to support this new measure of poverty so that we can all put our energy into creating the policies and solutions that build pathways out of poverty."" The latest study from the SMC,externalshows there are 2.5 million people in the UK who are less than 10% above the poverty line, which means small changes in circumstances could see them fall below it. But the SMC said there was good news from their metrics too, with far fewer pensioners living in poverty than was previously thought thanks to a ""significant fall"" in pensioner poverty over the last 15 years. The poverty rates varied significantly across the UK though. The lowest rates were in Scotland - almost 3% lower than the UK's overall figure of 22% - and the highest were in Wales - around 24%. England showed the highest levels of child poverty - close to 33%. A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Measuring poverty is complex, and this report offers further insight into that complexity and the additional measures that can be taken into consideration. ""This government is committed to making a positive difference to the outcomes for poor and disadvantaged families and children.""

"Labour is calling for a ban on parents-to-be being told the sex of their baby after early blood tests, amid fears it may lead to abortions of girls. The Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) is used by the NHS to test for genetic conditions, but people can pay for it privately to discover a baby's sex. Labour MP Naz Shah said it was morally wrong for people to use the test to abort pregnancies based on the outcome. The Department of Health said it would continue to review the evidence. An investigation by the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found thousands of British women discussing using NIPT to determine sex on an online forum. Ms Shah, who is shadow women and equalities minister, said cultural practices in some communities like the South Asian community, have a preference for boys. She said this put great strain on women ""forcing them to adopt methods such as NIPT to live up to expectations of family members"". NIPT involves taking a sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood, to gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome. It can also be used to determine sex, information which NHS doctors will not be sharing with parents when the test is rolled out across England next month. Private clinics offer the same test for around Â£150-Â£200 and do share this information. Some require only that a drop of blood be sent in the post with results sent back in a few days. Ms Shah said: ""NIPT screenings should be used for their intended purpose, to screen for serious conditions and Down's syndrome. ""The government needs to look into this exploitative practice and enforce appropriate restrictions."" 'I had a panic attack when they said it was a girl' Zara, not her real name, is Sikh and lives in Greater London. ""I had straightaway made that decision that I didn't want to have this baby. ""We were a family of five girls and every time my Mum had another daughter everyone would come to the house as if they were coming to mourn. ""For them it's like a burden. My fear was I didn't want to go through what my mother went through."" Zara discovered the sex of her baby five months into her pregnancy and opted to have a surgical abortion. She now regrets the decision. ""You see friends and family that have daughters and they have such a lovely relationship. I'm someone's daughter and someone's sister,"" she said. Zara says she believes abortion on the grounds of sex is a ""very common"" practice. Rani Bilkhu from the Jeena International organisation says many women say they have suffered violence or been coerced into abortions because they were pregnant with a second or third girl. It wants sex-selective abortion to be viewed as a form of honour-based violence. ""No wonder they're resorting to sex-selection abortion because they've got no choice,"" she says. ""They don't want to be homeless, they don't want their marriage to fail - all because they couldn't give birth to a boy."" The online forums where British women discussed using NIPT include thousands of posts where women express their anxiety about having a girl. One said: ""I need a son to heal me... my only bet is NIPT followed by continuation, only if it's a boy."" The programme also found one area, Slough, where women's clinics offering these tests were being promoted on roadside adverts. ""This poster is really telling the community, 'Come here, come to us and we'll let you know whether you're having a boy or a girl,'"" says Ms Bilkhu. Labour MP for Slough, Tan Dhesi, said marketing tests offering sex determination should be stamped out. ""Communities in South Asia have made huge strides in tackling this social evil,"" he said. ""That's been primarily through legislation, banning gender determination clinics. In the UK I think we need to be doing likewise, with regards to the private sector as well."" Ms Bilkhu said the scale of the problem was extremely hard to measure Choosing an abortion due to sex is illegal in the UK, apart from some rare exemptions, but it is difficult to detect as women often cite other reasons for having the procedure. In 2015, the government acknowledged it did not know how widespread testing for sex was. It said if NIPT became more popular, it would need to analyse the impact it was having on the gender ratio in ethnic minority communities. Ms Bilkhu said it was extremely hard to measure. ""Not only do the government not understand there's an issue around sex-selection abortion, but also charities and statutory sectors aren't asking the questions,"" she said. The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, recently held a consultation on NIPT testing. It believes the ability to determine sex reinforces pressure on women to have boys. ""The desire for sex-selection is a major driver of private-sector testing,"" said Tom Shakespeare from the council. ""I don't think the government want to regulate, they just don't like it in any sector. ""But countries like China and India have recognised the problem of sex-selective abortion and so it's very difficult to get this information - in India it is illegal.  So if we allow it, people will come here as tourists."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""The pre-natal test is never meant to be used for determining the sex of a child. We will continue to review the evidence."" Watch the BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK.

"Sewing needles have been inserted inside strawberries in Australia Australia has ordered an investigation into the discovery of sewing needles hidden in strawberries, amid growing alarm over scares across the country. Contaminated punnets have now been reported in six states and territories. A minister called it a ""vicious crime"". One man was taken to hospital after eating a strawberry that held a needle. Several brands have been recalled, while New Zealand's biggest grocers have stopped selling Australian strawberries as a precaution. Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt ordered the Food Safety Authority of Australia and New Zealand to investigate the scare. ""This is a very vicious crime and it's a general attack on the public,"" he said. Local authorities are also investigating, but no suspects have been identified. Cases of fruit tampering were first reported in Queensland last week, before spreading to New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. Growers and police have suggested that some cases may be copycat incidents. Six of eight states and territories have been affected The Queensland state government has offered a A$100,000 (Â£55,000; $72,000) reward for information. ""How could any right-minded person want to put a baby or a child or anybody's health at risk by doing such a dreadful act?"" Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Saturday. On Thursday, the Queensland Strawberry Growers' Association said the needles may have been placed by a ""disgruntled employee"". However, police said that it was too early to speculate. Pomegranate contamination kills woman Melon listeria kills three in Australia At least six brands have been caught up in the scare: Berry Obsession, Berry Licious, Love Berry, Donnybrook Berries, Delightful Strawberries and Oasis. Health officials have advised Australians to cut up strawberries before eating them. Growers have expressed concerns that the scare, which has come during the peak of production, could have a negative effect on sales for an industry worth about A$130m a year. Strawberry prices have already dropped around the country, with prices in Western Australia now below the cost of production, ABC News reported over the weekend. On Monday, New Zealand's two largest food distributors - Countdown and Foodstuffs - said they had stopped importing Australian strawberries due to the scare.

"MP Tobias Ellwood rushed to the aid of PC Keith Palmer after the attack An MP who fought to save the life of PC Keith Palmer during last year's Westminster terror attack has told an inquest how a doctor ordered him to stop giving CPR. Tobias Ellwood rushed to helpPC Palmer after he was stabbed by Khalid Masood on 22 March. But a doctor told Mr Ellwood, ""you've done your best"", and PC Palmer died. After almost breaking down in court, the MP said: ""[We] closed the eyes and then I said 'I'm sorry'."" Mr Ellwood said that if he had taken his normal route into Parliament, he would have been closer to Masood as he launched the attack. ""I know I would have stepped forward and I regret not having the opportunity to do so,"" he added. Four other people died after Masood drove into them on Westminster Bridge. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers during the attack - will take place afterwards. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Watch: 'Hero' MP's emotional terror attack defiance Westminster attack PC 'unprotected' at gate Mr Ellwood - Conservative MP for Bournemouth East and a medically trained former Army officer - told the court he was in a meeting close by when the attack occurred. He said he heard a crash followed by screams, adding: ""These were not screams of pain... these were screams of shock."" After running through crowds of people with ""panic in their eyes"" and hearing shots fired, Mr Ellwood said he saw a number of police officers crouched near Carriage Gate - which leads to New Palace Yard, outside the Houses of Parliament - and PC Palmer and Masood on the floor. He said the three officers helping PC Palmer looked like they needed assistance, so he ran towards them. They told him he was risking his life because of the chance of a secondary attack, but the MP - whose brother died in the Bali attack in 2002 - told the court: ""My brother was killed in a secondary attack... so I was very aware of that. ""I was concerned about what would happen if things were to ratchet up, but my immediate concern was that we had somebody who was clearly badly bleeding and needed assistance."" PC Keith Palmer was pronounced dead at 15:15 on the day of the attack Mr Ellwood said PC Palmer was unconscious, but that he still had a pulse, telling the court: ""I was encouraged that we'd arrived on the scene early enough to do something."" But PC Palmer's heart stopped, and Mr Ellwood had to begin chest compressions while someone else gave the officer mouth-to-mouth. ""By this time the whole of Westminster was very silent,"" he said. A medical team arrived by helicopter and moved PC Palmer so they could operate on him in the courtyard. Mr Ellwood had to pause in the witness box, before saying: ""Forgive me, it's sometimes easier to do the helping rather than to talk about it afterwards."" Despite their efforts, the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. Mr Ellwood said: ""I told a doctor present 'you're going to have to order me to stop', and the medic said, 'Sir, you've done your best, but you do need to stop'. ""We both covered the body as best we could, closed the eyes and I said: 'I'm sorry.' ""It was a very strange end to a very traumatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left completely alone with just one other person."" Dr Antony Hudson from London's Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, who performed the surgery on PC Palmer, told the court it would have been ""nearly impossible to return a cardiac output"" to a patient in that condition. By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old Bailey Tobias Ellwood came to Court One at the Old Bailey today to give evidence - not as an MP, but as a man who tried to help save the life of a dying police officer. He stood in the witness box for nearly an hour, at times with his hands gripped onto the oak-panelled sides. His voice, calm and measured, set against the ""screams of shock"" and ""panic in peoples eyes"" which he described. He paused every so often as the memories of that day came back. As he began describing the surgery carried out on PC Palmer on the ground, he stopped talking and stayed silent for some seconds. When Mr Ellwood finished his evidence, the barrister for PC Palmer's widow thanked him for his efforts to help the officer. Despite his harrowing experience, Mr Ellwood called on other members of the public to ""step forward"" in the face of terrorist incidents. He told the court: ""I know the official advice is to step back, report it. ""[But] I find myself countering that somewhat, because if more of us do step forward as we saw in the Manchester attack - London Bridge and Westminster Bridge as well - the message gets through that no terrorist is going to win."" Asked by the lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, about security in Westminster, Mr Ellwood said there had always been a ""sense of vulnerability"" around the Houses of Parliament and that, at times, there had been less firearms protection at the site than he would have liked. But he did not want it to become ""a tower of protection"", as it would ""change the face of what Parliament is about"". The MP added: ""[With] the level of security we have in place [now], I'm not sure we could do more.""

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong A powerful storm which killed dozens of people in the Philippines is now making its way across southern China. Typhoon Mangkhut is one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in decades. Two people have been killed in the Chinese province of Guangdong, according to state media - more than 2.5 million people have been evacuated in Guangdong and on Hainan island. In Hong Kong, the storm wrecked buildings and shut down the city. The typhoon is now moving inland, and is expected to hit the Chinese regions of Guizhou, Chongqing and Yunnan later in the day. In the Philippines, 33 miners have been confirmed dead and at least 29 are missing after a landslide hit a mining site in Itogon in Benguet province, according to local reports. Search and rescue missions are continuing, and there are fears the death toll could rise above 100, said Itogon's mayor, Victorio Palangdan. Families move to safer ground after landslides hit Itogon town in Benguet province People caught outside as the worst of the storm approached were photographed overwhelmed by conditions In Hong Kong, which was hit hard over the weekend, videos on social media showed apartments swaying in the wind, scaffolding crashing to the ground and commercial buildings with windows shattered. Transport services have also been suspended, with flights cancelled, trains stopped and major roads closed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mangkhut is expected to gradually weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday as it continues to move inland. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon. In pictures: Deadly typhoon hits China Officials put the number of injured in Hong Kong at more than 200. Despite avoiding a direct hit, winds there reached more than 110mph and as water levels surged by almost 3.5m (12ft) in places. Authorities had issued their maximum alert, warning residents to stay indoors and away from windows to avoid flying debris. Most shops and public services were shut, and about 900 flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport. A resident living in a high-rise in the city told Reuters news agency she could feel her building swaying in the storm. ""It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours,"" Elaine Wong said. ""It made me feel so dizzy."" In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history, the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. The heavy winds smashed in windows in some Hong Kong high-rises Downtown roads were pictured deluged with water, stranding vehicles The storm ploughed across the main Philippine island of Luzon over the weekend. Most of the deaths there were caused by landslides, government officials say. Dozens of people are still missing after the storm, which is being called Ompong locally.

Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? The BBC's Howard Johnson in the Philippines described a trail of destruction along the northern coast of Luzon with forests ripped to shreds and electricity poles felled. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited the badly affected area of Tuguegarao on Sunday There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Preparation and evacuation procedures have improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

"Kevin Beattie won nine caps for England Former team-mates and opponents have been paying tribute to ex-Ipswich and England defender Kevin Beattie, who has died from a suspected heart attack. Former England captain Terry Butcher said he was ""devastated"" by the death of the 64-year-old. ""He was my hero and my inspiration,"" Butcher said. ""You try to model yourself on him but it was impossible - he was the complete footballer."" George Burley, who won the FA Cup with Beattie, said he was ""a legend"". Beattie was born in Carlisle and moved to Ipswich when he was 15, going on to make 296 starts for the club, scoring 32 goals. He was a PFA Young Player of the Year, represented England nine times and also won the Uefa Cup under Sir Bobby Robson. He is widely considered by fans and former players of Ipswich to be the club's best-ever player. This video can not be played Kevin Beattie: Ex team-mates pay tribute to the defender Beattie, back row with arm raised, won the FA Cup with Ipswich Town in 1978 Flags were flying at half-mast at Portman Road on Monday Sir Bobby, who died in 2009, said Beattie was the ""best defensive player that this country has produced"". In his autobiography, Sir Bobby said he signed Beattie after scout Ron Gray described him as a ""colossus"" with a ""neck like a bull"". Butcher said he first watched Beattie as a fan and idolised him throughout his career. ""I used to watch him from the terraces and marvel at his strength and ability,"" Butcher told BBC Radio Suffolk. ""He used to hurt people by simple tackles but he wasn't vicious, he was one of the loveliest men you'd meet on the pitch as well - he was a gentleman. But he was strong and wanted to win.""

Beattie's career was hampered by injuries and it was all but over when he left Ipswich at the age of 28. ""He put his body on the line, and in the end his injuries helped other people, myself included, get in the team,"" Butcher said. ""But you didn't want to get in the team because I just used to love watching him play. ""He had spring-like legs. His spring and timing was immaculate. When he went up to head the ball, nobody else was going to win it. ""When he used to shoot with his left foot it was like an Exocet."" Kevin Beattie continued to live in Ipswich, caring for his wife Beattie was known for his aerial ability and strong left foot George Burley said Beattie's athleticism and determination to win meant ""nobody could play against him"". ""He was quicker than anybody, stronger; he was fantastic in the air, he had a left foot that was like a sledgehammer - he virtually scored from the halfway line in one game,"" Burley said. ""And as a fella, Kev was one of these lads where if anyone was struggling, he'd come help you. If somebody needed Â£2 for a taxi, 'I'll give you it', anything like that. ""If anybody wanted something they'd go to Kevin, and Kevin took it all on himself and really enjoyed doing that. He was that type of lad."" How a town was bewitched by the magic of the FA Cup 'The day a little market town grew up' - BBC News Kevin Beattie was a regular on BBC Radio Suffolk and was on air on Saturday Allan Hunter, whose partnership with Beattie earned them the nicknames ""Bacon and Eggs"" from Sir Bobby, said his former team-mate was a ""fantastic fella and a fantastic player"". ""He was the greatest thing I ever played with, and that includes George Best,"" the former Northern Ireland international said. Allow Twitter content?

""The team was littered with good players, but I think everyone would say he was our best one. ""Not only was he a great player, if you wanted someone who was absolutely perfect for the dressing room, Kevin Beattie was your man.

Roger Osborne, who scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Arsenal, said it had been an ""honour"" to share the pitch with Beattie. ""Beat was quite annoying, really, because everything came so easy for him,"" Osborne said. ""Us poorer players had to train really hard and work to keep our fitness. Beat used to stroll in and took it all for granted. ""He was just stronger, fitter and better than anyone else. He didn't have to try."" Veteran journalist Stuart Jarrold saw virtually every game Beattie played for Ipswich, and interviewed him many times, getting to know him well. ""He was a wonderful player - probably the best player ever to play for Ipswich Town,"" he said. ""He was a joy to watch in his pomp. Strong in the air, strong on the ground, strong in the tackle - he could run and beat players over 50 yards, and then shoot and break the back of the net from 30 yards. He'd leap in the air and his forehead would be level with the crossbar. ""Off the field, he was such an affable bloke. He never made any money out of football. He was the salt of the earth - he came from nothing as this 15-year-old kid."" Ipswich beat West Brom to reach the FA Cup final in 1978 Jarrold believes that had Beattie not been forced out of the game through injury, he would have gone on to win many more England caps, and that he has no equivalent in modern football. ""The game has changed. He was a colossus. There's no-one else like him,"" he said. ""What would he be worth in today's transfer market? As Bobby Robson said, he was priceless."" John Wark, part of the FA Cup and Uefa Cup-winning sides, said Beattie, lovingly called ""Monster"" by his team-mates, was ""the best-ever"" player for Ipswich. ""We had a lot of other great players but Beat was the one they couldn't get by in the European games,"" he said. ""His downfall was his injuries."" Former opponents and more recent players also paid tribute to Beattie, with ex-Manchester United, England and Millwall winger Gordon Hill calling him ""a true gentleman and fantastic centre-half"".

Beattie was loved by fans and fellow professionals for his personality as much as his playing ability, with many of his team-mates describing him as a joker. Other stories paint him as a slightly hapless character, with Sir Bobby saying ""trouble seemed to find him easily"". In his autobiography, Sir Bobby recalled how Beattie once threw a can of petrol on a bonfire that had failed to light. From his hospital bed, Beattie told his manager he was ""all right"" and that he would be able to play the following day, but it turned out he was absent for the next five months. ""He was blessed and cursed at the same time,"" Sir Bobby wrote. ""Blessed with talent and cursed by bad luck."" Kevin Beattie's 1998 autobiography, The Beat, is full of tales of what John Motson refers to in the book's foreword as the ""madcap side"" of his character. Anecdotes include getting his foot stuck in a hotel shoe cleaner on the eve of the FA Cup final, being duped into appearing in a photo shoot with ""Spain's biggest porn star"" and being locked up overnight in a Bermuda prison for fears he was too drunk and would get in trouble. He describes two car crashes. In one, team-mate Robin Turner wrote off his car by hitting a lamp-post as Beattie decided to take off his knee bandage and put it over his face ""for a laugh"". In the other, in 1974, Beattie flipped his car on to its roof as he tried to overtake team-mate Brian Talbot's Ford Capri in a race to the training ground. Miraculously, only one of Beattie's three passengers received a minor injury. Sir Bobby Robson called Beattie ""strong as iron and daft as a brush"" Beattie writes fondly of his role as Michael Caine's double in the movie Escape to Victory, and is thrilled to recall how he won $100 from the ""arrogant"" Sylvester Stallone by beating him at arm-wrestling. Beattie, one of nine children and father to three daughters, talks of his humble background and how, throughout his life, he put family first. He writes that he dreams of taking his grandchildren to Disneyland in Florida, and of spending ""a couple of pounds"" a week on the National Lottery in the hope of getting lucky. Plenty is written about the thrill of winning the FA Cup, but there's equal excitement as Beattie recalls how he and other players were able to ""make a killing"" by selling surplus Wembley tickets. For all his successes, the sense that Beattie could have achieved more is never far away. ""Had I been able to keep fit, I reckon I would have played over 100 times for my country and joined an elite group of players,"" he writes. ""I bet I am not the only footballer who struggles. OK, it is great to be fit and healthy when you are young, but when you have to suffer when you finish, no-one tells you about that side of football. ""Mind you, I would still do the same again if I had the chance all over again."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Beattie broke his arm in what proved to be his last match for Ipswich, a 1-0 defeat to Manchester City in the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1981. He had short spells with Middlesbrough and Colchester after leaving Ipswich, but returned to the town to live after retiring. He led a modest life, caring for his wife Maggie, who has multiple sclerosis, in a council-owned bungalow. ""Ipswich Town is in my blood,"" Kevin Beattie wrote in his autobiography In 2012, speaking shortly after headmitted falsely claiming benefits, Beattie saidmore could be done to help former playerswho had fallen on hard times. He also reflected on whether injections to help him recover quickly from injuries had shortened his career. ""Football is the love of my life,"" he said. ""I've let myself down in a way, saying yes to injections and stuff like that. But I've got my memories and you can't take that away."" Mark Murphy's Breakfast show on BBC Radio Suffolk was dedicated to Kevin Beattie and featured tributes from several former team-mates as well as fans. You canlisten again via the iPlayer.

"This video can not be played Christine Lagarde has warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would entail ""substantial costs"" for the UK economy The International Monetary Fund has warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit on World Trade Organization terms would entail ""substantial costs"" for the UK economy. The IMF said thatall likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"",external, but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"". The challenges in getting a deal done remained ""daunting"", it said. The IMF expects Britain's economy to grow by 1.5% in both 2018 and 2019 if a broad Brexit agreement is struck. The predictions came in the IMF's latest annual assessment of the UK economy. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, told a news conference at the Treasury in London: ""Those projections assume a timely deal with the EU on a broad free trade agreement and a relatively orderly Brexit process after that. ""Any deal will not be as good as the smooth process under which goods, services, people and capital move around between the EU and the UK without impediments and obstacles."" Brexit: Where has the process got to? Brexit: All you need to know The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the government must listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"". He added: ""The IMF are clear today that no deal would be extremely costly for the UK as it would also for the EU, and that despite the contingency actions we're taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the past 10 years in repairing our economy."" Theresa May phones EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker The IMF warning comes as Theresa May told the BBC thatMPs must choose between her proposed deal with the EU - or no deal at all. Speaking to Panorama, the prime minister said that if Parliament does not ratify her Chequers plan, ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"". Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland to avoid a hard border there. A plan by Brexiteers to resolve the Irish border issue also came in for criticism from the prime minister, who said it would create a ""hard border 20km inside Ireland"". Please upgrade your browser The IMF's Ms Lagarde said a ""disorderly"" or ""crash"" exit from the EU would have a series of consequences, including reduced growth, an increased deficit and depreciation of sterling, causing the UK economy to contract. The IMF also said a no-deal outcome would affect other EU economies ""to a lesser extent"". ""The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""This should be fairly obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not."" She pointed out that countries tended to trade mostly with their neighbours: ""I think geography talks very loudly."" Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Comparing this year's IMF analysis and Ms Lagarde's words with last December and there is a significant cooling of sentiment around the effects of Brexit. The IMF is signalling that, with just over six months to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, the very fact that ""no deal"" remains on the table is of economic concern. When asked if she could see any ""positives"" coming from Brexit, Ms Lagarde repeated the long list of possible negatives. ""No,"" seemed to be her answer. Read Kamal's blog in full Ms Lagarde said she ""very much"" hoped that the UK and the EU would strike a deal, describing herself as ""a desperate optimist"". Recent UK economic data has shown a pick-up in growth. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics saidthe economy had grown by 0.6% over the three months to July- the fastest pace in almost a year. The latest IMF prediction represents a slight upgrade for 2018. In July, the IMF said the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2019.

"This video can not be played Hundreds rescued in deadly Florence floods As flooding continues to inundate North Carolina, the death toll from Florence has risen to at least 32, with 25 deaths confirmed in North Carolina. The state's governor, Roy Cooper, said on Monday that the ""epic storm"" was still an immediate danger as rivers reach major flood levels. The coastal city of Wilmington became an island amid heavy floods following the storm. Officials have warned evacuated residents to stay away. Wilmington grapples with Florence aftermath At a news conference on Monday, Gov Cooper said ""catastrophic flooding and tornados are still claiming lives and property"" across the state. ""For many parts of North Carolina the danger is still immediate,"" he said. ""Some areas have not seen the worst flooding yet. This is a monumental disaster for our state."" An initial estimate from Moody's Analytics puts the cost of Florence between $17bn (Â£13bn) and $22bn, making the storm one of the 10 costliest hurricanes in US history,according to NPR,external. Most of the monetary damage is due to property loss, and the company said these figures could rise as inland flooding continues. The Waffle House chain remained open in the marooned city - whether a town's Waffle House is open is one of the indicators FEMA uses to determine the scale of a disaster In Wilmington, with its population of about 120,000, some 400 people have had to be rescued from flood waters, and most of the city remains without power. The governor said that 23 truckloads of supplies were able to make it into Wilmington this morning, though officials are uncertain whether the single road into the city will remain functional as rivers continue to flood. The National Weather Service has warned of at least two further days of possible flash flooding in the area before conditions are forecast to improve. ""Do not come here,"" New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White said. ""We want you home, but you can't come yet."" A city-wide curfew has been extended after five people were arrested on suspicion of looting from a store on Saturday. The area is usually best known as a filming location for US dramas One Tree Hill and Dawson's Creek, and as the childhood home of US basketball legend Michael Jordan. Florence has now weakened to a tropical depression with winds of 30mph (45km/h), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Some parts of the Carolinas have seen up to 40in (100cm) of rain since Thursday. On Monday, the National Weather Service announced that the Cape Fear River near Fayetteville, North Carolina, is expected to reach the major flood stage - levels over 60ft (18m) - by this evening.

""We know that we're going to need significant federal resources, and they have promised them across the board,"" Gov Cooper said on Monday of Fema and DHS. Power companies are working to restore power to the nearly half a million homes and businesses in both states that are still without electricity. The storm has begun to move into Virginia and West Virginia, and is expected to turn toward New England on Tuesday. On Monday, police in Union County, North Carolina, recovered the body of a one-year-old boy who had been swept away by floodwaters. The boy's mother had driven around a barricade in the road and ended up stalled in rushing water. As she tried to leave the car, she lost grip of the boy and he was carried off in the floods, theNews & Observer,externalreported. An 88-year-old man was also found dead in Union County on Monday, next to a car that had been submerged in the floods. Among the other fatalities were two men in their 70s who died in Lenoir County - one had been connecting extension cords and another was blown by high winds when checking on his dogs. Four road deaths in South Carolina have been blamed on the storm, and two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

"The Irish border is the single biggest sticking point at this stage of the Brexit negotiations. The Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to leave the EU's customs union and single market but at the same time has promised no hardening of the border. That means no new physical infrastructure and no new checks or controls for customs or product standards Her solution is the Chequers plan, with its ""combined customs territory"" and ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules on goods and agriculture. Now, the European Research Group (ERG), which backs a ""clean-break Brexit"", has suggested another way, which avoids the need to follow all those EU rules. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the ERG, said it provided a solution for the Irish border ""in a way that any reasonable person would think meets the requirements of the European Union's concerns over the single market"". It has similarities to an earlier government plan, which proposed the continuation of some existing UK-EU arrangements and the use of technology to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. The Irish border: Brexit's 310-mile problem Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade Reality Check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland? Perhaps the most difficult issue for the Irish border is the movement of food and agriculture products. Those products are the major component of cross-border trade but they also face some of the strictest EU rules. The rules mean consignments of food or animals can enter the EU only through specified border inspection posts. Those involve mandatory document checks and a significant proportion of consignments must also be physically checked. It is likely the challenge posed by those rules nudged the prime minister towards the ""common rule book"", which would involve signing a treaty committing the UK to continued harmonisation with EU rules. The ERG approach is for an ""equivalence"" arrangement, where the EU would accept that, while UK food and agriculture rules would be different, they would still be as good as EU rules and would not put consumers at risk. It backs this up with reference to a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on food and plant safety, suggesting this would require the EU to offer equivalence However, many trade experts believe this overstates the particular strength of that agreement. The ERG document also mentions the equivalence provision in the EU-Canada trade deal - but it doesn't add that under that deal there are still documentary checks on all meat and dairy imports, with 10% subject to physical checks. The EU has been prepared to remove requirements for border inspection but only with countries that have adopted its rules. Switzerland is an example - it modifies its laws in response to changes in EU legislation and must monitor third-country exports at EU-approved border inspection posts. So, the sort of equivalence the ERG is hoping for would mean a unique approach by the EU. Please upgrade your browser One intriguing aspect of the ERG report is that, when it comes to agricultural products, it approves of the existing arrangements that mean the whole island of Ireland is a ""common biosecurity zone"". This means that animals being moved from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are subject to checks and controls, even though this is an internal UK movement. Those animals need an import licence and the exporter needs to arrange for an approved vet to examine the animals before they leave for Northern Ireland. The vet will then apply for an export health certificate. An animal transport certificate is also required. The animals and all the paperwork are checked on arrival at Larne Harbour, County Antrim. The report says: ""It has been recognised by all communities on the island of Ireland that it is sensible to capitalise on the protection afforded by the sea."" Does that leave the door open to additional checks, for example, of food products, that are being imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland? That would eliminate the need for border inspection posts but is unlikely to be approved of by the Democratic Unionist Party, whose support in Parliament the government needs. And again, this is an area where a flexible approach would be required by the EU as there is no other example of a common biosecurity zone between the EU and a region of a non-EU country. Another area where the ERG is hoping for an accommodating approach from the EU is on VAT. The report proposes that the UK would have continued access to the EU's VAT Information Exchange System (VIES). That would help avoid the need for VAT liabilities to be assessed by customs officials as products arrived at the Irish border. The ERG also describes the VAT system as providing a framework for streamlining customs controls. That streamlining involves: filing documents electronically the use of licensed customs brokers having any inspections at the factory rather than the border Familiar plans for ""trusted trader"" schemes are also laid out. The concern for small businesses in particular is that this is not frictionless trade - it means more red tape and the use of customs brokers, for example, would mean additional costs. More fundamentally, it is not at all clear on what terms the EU would allow continued access to the VIES and if those terms would be acceptable to the ERG. Would the UK agree to continued adherence to the EU VAT Directive and oversight from the European Court of Justice? Would the UK seek an even deeper VAT agreement than the one Norway was - an arrangement that took four years to negotiate?

"The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has lowered its UK growth forecast, and warns by 2020 the economy will have experienced its second-weakest decade. The BCC has lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2018 from 1.3% to 1.1% and in 2019 from 1.4% to 1.3%. Its forecast for 2020 is unchanged at 1.6% growth. The downgrades are driven by a weaker outlook for trade and investment. Exporters face more subdued growth over continued Brexit uncertainty and slower growth in key markets, it says. It adds that the high upfront cost of doing business in the UK and the ongoing uncertainty over the UK's future relationship with the EU are expected to continue to stifle business investment. ""Despite strong performances by some firms, the UK economy as a whole is set to grow at a snail's pace,"" said Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on many firms, as most of the practical questions facing trading businesses remain unanswered. ""The lack of precision on the nature of the UK's future relationship with the EU is lowering expectations for both business investment and export growth. ""The drag effect on investment and trade would intensify in the event of a 'messy' and disorderly Brexit. ""Businesses need the Brexit negotiations to deliver clarity, precision and results at pace over the coming weeks."" The BCC says the government must now work to bolster business confidence, slash costs, and encourage business investment. The labour market is expected to continue to be a source of strength for the economy, with the unemployment rate predicted to remain close to its record low. But the BCC warns firms will face ""significant"" skills gaps, undermining their potential to grow. Meanwhile workers are unlikely to experience meaningful real wage growth as the gap between pay and price growth is forecast to remain negligible. It says it now sees interest rates reaching 1.25% by 2020.

"It's felt like a long time to get this far. Decades of debate about our place in the EU. Years of push me, pull you debates on the right, about whether there should be a referendum on our membership of the European Union. The crashing highs and lows, and lows and highs of the referendum campaign itself. And since then, more than 18 months of the Brexit process squeezing the life out of almost everything else in our politics - still a subject of huge division, of frustration, of thrill and excitement, of concern and fascination and question marks. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, says May Reality Check: How are Brexit preparations getting on? Much of 'Brexit' is mind-numbing to many in its complexity and level of detail. Some of the political game-playing is tedious soap opera to all but a precious few. The parliamentary process is vital but labyrinthine. The layers upon layers of party divisions are ever shifting, and hard to track. But what looks like a series of individual clashes, or indeed occasionally a shambles, matters. Because the eventual decisions that will and are being made in all of our names are a product of all of those tangles, and they will affect our livelihoods and the place of the country in the world for many years to come. Please upgrade your browser With six months to go, and a critical meeting of EU leaders later this week, where the UK hopes to move into the next phase, it's worth taking a breath and reflecting, in a way that's not exhaustive,  on where this process has got to. The most likely outcome right now is that a deal between the UK and the EU will be done in November. If that happens it will be made up of a legally binding withdrawal agreement - that contains the cash, what happens to citizens on both sides, and in theory, a solution for Northern Ireland. Alongside that will be the document that in theory shapes the future of the relationship for good - the political declaration. However, as we joked at the beginning of the process that the deal was likely in the end to be a fudge, so it seems that could come to pass. Behind the scenes diplomats and politicians are starting to talk about the declaration being vague, in order that trickiest issues don't have to be resolved yet. A senior cabinet minister told me last week, 'ambiguity might be the way out'. Michael Gove even suggested publicly on Sunday that this year's deal doesn't have to be the end of the story. One diplomat told me that a vague deal might be the way through but that means Brexit would then essentially go on for years - 'If the vagueness is the solution then at the end we start again'. This set of Brexit talks would conclude, only for years of a next phase to begin. But this is becoming known as 'blind Brexit', and while it is a possible way out of the talks it has obvious problems. One MP joked that we might end up with an 'agreement of adjectives'. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The most pressing argument against a vague deal is concern over the Irish border. Again in his column in the Daily Telegraph, the former foreign secretary expresses his frustration with how that question has become such a central issue in the talks. But frankly, it's been the blindingly obvious case for many months, that without a convincing arrangement coming from the UK side, the EU will find it extremely difficult to do the deal, without forcing their backstop. There's talk in negotiation circles of 'backstop 2', there's talk of a way of softening the language around the EU's position. And, of course, Brexiteers are trying hard to force Theresa May to put a different set of arrangements on the table. There is, however, no chance of her shifting, at least not until after the end of the Conservative conference. Her Chequers agreement where officials and ministers drafted a way through the EU and UK red lines is her plan for now and she isn't budging until she is forced to. Without going through the arguments as we have discussed many times here, her Chequers deal is one of the reasons why her job is at risk. Since the election, her handling of Brexit has made her vulnerable to circling rivals in the Tory party. Her advocates believe she has displayed extraordinary resilience holding on so far. But there is a sense of foreboding around the place. More and more MPs are willing to say publicly that after Brexit her time is limited. One senior MP suggested to me that if those close to the Prime Minister aren't telling her that then they are in fact doing her a disservice. The Tories have been lucky though in one sense. An opposition party that was less distracted by its own woes could be tearing strips off the government daily. As it is, with Labour's own problems so clearly on display, the government is in a less precarious position than you might expect. But they are vulnerable, enormously vulnerable, in the next couple of months. Assuming that there is a deal of some sorts (if it is possible to assume anything), the government is not certain to be able to get the vote through the House of Commons. Government insiders believe the vote will get through, that most MPs will choose the relative stability of a deal, rather than take the risk. One Tory MP even said last week, 'any deal is better than no deal'. But, and it is a big but, Tory hard core eurosceptics might join with the opposition parties to bring the deal down. They really might.  If that happens there is no map and no precedent. Those campaigning vigorously for a second referendum believe that could be their opportunity to push for a second vote. The Labour  Party hope that would bring a general election giving them an opportunity to win. A vote could sink Theresa May, or even re-open the referendum. The bumps of the last two years could be nothing in comparison to that.

"This video can not be played The Institute for Government says time is running short to implement a successful Brexit With just over six months to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union, a report from the London-based think tank, the Institute for Government (IFG), has warned that - deal or no deal - the government is running short of time to implement a successful Brexit. The IFG says,externalTheresa May's government has left its ""no-deal"" preparations too late to help many businesses, and in most policy areas it would not be able to avoid damage to the economy next year. Even if a deal is reached, the IFG says, the proposed 21-month transition period after Brexit - which would expire at the end of December 2020 - does not give enough time to agree and ratify a future trade deal. All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU What would a ""no deal"" look like? Key dates and potential hurdles BBC News asked the IFG to assess the readiness of preparations for leaving the EU, which the report describes as an ""unprecedented task for modern government"". The report divides the challenges into negotiation, legislation and implementation and identifies serious obstacles in all three areas, concluding that implementation is the biggest concern of all. Progress has certainly been made on negotiations on a Withdrawal Agreement, and there is""potential for a deal"" in the coming weeks.But talks on the outline of a future trade relationship have barely begun. And if the Withdrawal Agreement is not finalised soon, time to pass the necessary legislation to ratify and implement it will be in short supply. When it comes to ""no-deal"" plans, ministers insist they are ""far advanced"" and the IFG agrees thatprogress has been made.But businesses also need to be ready for dramatic change and the IFG says government guidance to business and consumers on how to prepare has come too late. The report says other European governments, such as the Irish and Dutch, published their ""no-deal"" guidance ""much earlier"". The report uses a traffic light system to assess overall progress. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019, only one policy area - EU programmes and funds - is coloured green, suggesting that the government will be ready. Nine other broad policy areas - including borders, citizens and migration, agriculture, fisheries and food, health, transport, tax and data and services - are given a red light, suggesting the government won't be able to avoid ""major negative impacts"" of no deal next year. Even if a deal is reached, which is what the government wants, implementing Brexit in the 21-month transition period - which would, among other things, mean agreeing and ratifying a future trade deal - looks ""completely unfeasible"", according to the report. For example, the IFG says that more than 140,000 businesses would need to be ready for changes at UK borders, and new customs systems would not be ready in time. It notes that the government is hiring 9,000 extra staff and spending Â£2bn on Brexit preparations by March 2019, with more money allocated for 2019-20; but it warns that ""Brexit is the biggest implementation challenge government has faced in generations"". To give a sense of scale, it has compared the Brexit transition with other major UK government projects over the last few years. The automatic pension enrolment programme, and preparations for the London Olympics, both took more than a decade to prepare and implement; digitising tax took five years. Implementing Brexit in 21 months will, by comparison, be extremely tight. The IFG report also compares the length of the transition period (21 months) with the time taken to negotiate and fully implement recent free trade agreements. The EU-Canada free trade deal that we hear so much about has taken more than seven years so far. The EU-South Korea deal took nine years. In other words, even if ""no deal"" on a withdrawal agreement is avoided in March 2019, the government will still be facing the prospect of ""no deal"" on a comprehensive trade agreement in December 2020, at the end of the transition period. The clock is ticking in Parliament too. If a deal on a Withdrawal Agreement is reached this autumn, possibly in mid-November, there would only be about 70 sitting days in Parliament before Brexit is due to happen. In the past, says the IFG, significant treaty change has taken about 40 days to get through Parliament. Part of a potential 70-day period would have to be devoted to other issues such as debating the Budget and passing a finance bill. The government will also need to win a ""meaningful vote"" on its deal with the EU in the House of Commons, before trying to pass legislation giving the Withdrawal Agreement effect in UK law. And while a number of votes may be tight, so too will be the number of days. The House of Commons could choose to sit more often on a Friday to add extra days, but there will not be much room for manoeuvre. In the past 18 months, the IFG says there have been some big achievements and the government has passed six of the 13 Brexit bills currently announced. But there are now only six months to go. The government also needs to pass about 800 pieces of secondary legislation (known as statutory instruments) to ensure that UK law actually works properly on the day the UK leaves the EU. The Department for Exiting the European Union says its planning demonstrates that it can be done, but ""there is a lot of work to do in order to manage it"". Please upgrade your browser An additional challenge, the IFG points out, is that ""until a full Withdrawal Agreement is locked down in legal text"", government preparations for no deal have to continue. In the event of no deal, of course, Parliament will have to scramble to pass all sorts of legislation for sudden change in a whole host of policy areas. ""There is a real risk,"" the IFG argues, ""that this will not be in place, and the UK will face a legal hiatus."" The risks are reflected in the traffic lights: if there is a deal they are green for most legislation, except for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would still need to be passed and is flashing amber. With no deal, again there is some green, indicating that plans are already in place. But there are plenty of pieces of legislation coloured amber, suggesting uncertainty, and on the future rights of citizens in the event of no deal, the lights remain red. An awful lot depends on the next few weeks - as negotiations with the EU on a Withdrawal Agreement, the terms on which the UK will leave, reach their final phase. The two sides also need to agree a political declaration on the future relationship - and persuade the UK and European parliaments to accept it all. The IFG's negotiation traffic lights have a lot in green, including a financial settlement, citizens, and agreement in principle on the transition period. Officials say the deal is at least 80% done. ""We make progress every week and a deal is within our sights,"" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons this month. But the IFG also designates some amber issues - including governance (the role of the European Court of Justice), and the status of Gibraltar; while the toughest part of all - avoiding a hard border in Ireland - is still flashing red. The other red light in this section refers to the fraught process of ratification in the UK Parliament, while the government also needs to renegotiate hundreds of agreements with other countries - on trade and other issues - to replace those it has been part of as an EU member. Brexit, the IFG concludes, is likely to lead to ""unprecedented levels of change across huge swathes of policy simultaneously"". That is one of the reasons why many people are campaigning for a People's Vote or second referendum, once the details of any deal to leave are revealed. That, of course, is not government policy. But with six months to go, the whole process remains highly uncertain. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"It's been more than two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the negotiations, pronouncements and progress reports seem never-ending. So while there's just over six months until Brexit day, with a 21-month transition period after that, we ask why does it seem to be taking sooo long?  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

"This video can not be played Theresa May told Panorama: 'I think that the alternative to that (the Chequers plan) will be not having a deal' Theresa May has told the BBC that MPs will have a choice between her proposed deal with the EU - or no deal at all. She was also critical of a plan by Brexiteers to resolve the Irish border issue, saying it would create a ""hard border 20km inside Ireland"". The prime minister did admit that under ""no-deal there would be some short-term disruption"". Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said no-deal would be ""catastrophic"" and people were ""too casual about it"". He told Panorama: ""It's not viable. It's rhetoric, not reality, and it can't be allowed to happen."" But Mrs May said it was the government's job to ""make sure we make a success of no-deal, just as we make a success of getting a good deal."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Under no deal there would be some short-term disruption"" Her comments were in response to questioning about theBank of England's governor Mark Carney's warningthat a no-deal Brexit could see house prices crash by more than a third. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fundhas saidthe UK economy will shrink without a Brexit deal. In its annual assessment of the UK economy, the IMF said that all likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"", but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government had to listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"". Brexit: All you need to know Chequers plan 'will avoid hard border' May 'irritated' by leadership speculation Reality Check: The UK's Brexit preparations The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations between the two sides are still taking place. Mrs May set out her proposals for the key issue of cross-border trade after a Chequers summit in July, but it has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers who say plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Speaking to Panorama, Mrs May said that if Parliament does not ratify the Chequers plan ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Theresa May calculated that faced with a ""binary choice"" of the Chequers deal or no deal, Brexiteers would not have the ""chutzpah to say 'no way'"" and Remainers would decide that carrying on fighting the plan would be too risky. But the risks are that the PM cannot say for certain what the final deal will look like - and some Brexiteers were already determined not to vote for it, she added. The Panorama documentary features Theresa May and husband Philip watching ITV show The Chase at Chequers Mr Johnson's column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalrenewed his attack on the Chequers proposals and the government's plans for avoiding new border checks on the Northern Irish border. He criticised the UK's decision to agree with the EU on the need for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border irrespective of a trade deal, saying the issue was being used ""to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels"". Downing Street responded by saying Mr Johnson had been part of the government that signed up to the backstop plan. In her Panorama interview, Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. Last week a group of Brexiteer Tory MPs said a hard border could be avoided by using ""established"" technology and ""modifying"" existing arrangements. Mr Johnson refers to the suggestions by the European Research Group in his column, saying that ""extra checks done away from the border"" would prevent the need for physical checks when vehicles move between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Theresa May hits back at Boris Johnson over Chequers plan But Mrs May insisted that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"". ""You don't solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland,"" she said. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""insult to the intelligence of British voters"" for the prime minister to say it was a ""choice between either the Chequers fudge or a cataclysmic cliff edge"". Speaking later at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton,Sir Nick claimedEuropean leaders were ""seeking to find some way of giving Britain more time"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC the prime minister should ""try a bit harder"" to get a better deal. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May has found herself embattled with some in her party, after about 50 European Research Group Tory MPs openly discussed how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister. On Sunday Brexit-supporting Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the Chequers plan was the right one ""for now"". He told the BBC a future prime minister could alter the relationship between the UK and the EU. Mrs May will attempt to persuade EU leaders of the merits of her plans at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday. With nearly six months to go until exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, a poll commissioned by BBC Radio 5 Live suggests that the UK remains split over whether Brexit will be positive for the UK. According to a Comres survey, 50% of British adults feel the overall impact will be negative, whereas 41% think it will be positive. When asked about the handling of Brexit negotiations, almost 79% of people polled thought that the government had handled them badly, and 63% thought the EU had handled them badly. The People's Vote campaign, meanwhile, claimed a ""fresh wave"" of 18-year-olds becoming eligible to vote was ""transforming the dynamics of the Brexit debate"" because they mostly back staying in the EU.

"Luke Massella, aged 10 in 2001 with his mother and uncle, had to undergo surgery many times Bioprinting human tissue using specialised 3D printers promises to transform medicine, with implications for organ transplants, cancer treatment and antibiotic development. Luke Massella is one of about 10 people alive walking around with a replacement bladder that has been grown from his own cells. He was born with a condition called spina bifida, which, from birth, left a gap in his spine. By 10 years old, he had survived a dozen surgeries and beaten doctors' initial expectations that he'd never walk. But then a malfunctioning bladder made his kidneys fail. ""I was kind of facing the possibility I might have to do dialysis [blood purification via machine] for the rest of my life,"" he says. ""I wouldn't be able to play sports, and have the normal kid life with my brother."" An enterprising surgeon, Anthony Atala at Boston Children's Hospital, took a small piece of Luke's bladder, and over two months grew a new one in the lab. Then in a 14-hour surgical procedure he replaced the defective bladder with the new one. Dr Atala has pioneered growing replacement body tissue and organs in the laboratory ""So it was pretty much like getting a bladder transplant, but from my own cells, so you don't have to deal with rejection,"" says Luke. Rejection is when the body's immune system attacks transplanted cells that come from another organism. Using tissue grown from a patient's own cells helps combat this effect. Luke went on to be a wrestling coach in the Connecticut public schools and now, at 27, runs events in the jewellery industry. ""Pretty much I was able to live a normal life after,"" he says. He underwent surgery 17 times before he was 13, but hasn't had to since. Dr Atala's work involves bioprinting, using modified 3D inkjet machines to produce biological tissue. His team has developed ""eight cell-based tissues we put into patients,"" he says, including engineered skin, urethras, and cartilage, all grown in the lab. Bioprinters can help create organic replacement body parts like this urethra in the making These engineered organs are going through clinical trials for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. ""You need to know how to make these organs by hand, then the bioprinter is really a scale-up tool,"" says Dr Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina. In other words, bioprinting would enable these organs to be made in an affordable, consistent, and precisely constructed way, he believes. ""Flat structures like skin"" are easiest to print, he says. Then ""tubular structures like blood vessels and urethras"" are a little more complex, with ""hollow non-tubular organs like bladders"" harder still. But hardest are ""solid organs like hearts, lungs, and kidneys,"" with ""so many more cells per centimetre"". For these highly complex organs bioprinters provide a precision that surpasses human hands, he says. Bioprinting has taken off following a dramatic discovery by Shinya Yamanaka and Sir John Gurdon, who  a Nobel Prize for their work in 2012. Adult ordinary cells can now be reprogrammed to make stem cells - called induced pluripotent stem cells - which can be used to make any other cell in the body. ""A lot has happened in the last couple of years,"" says Steven Morris, chief executive of bioprinting start-up Biolife4d. Mr Morris is working to bioprint a heart using these pluripotent cells over the next year. This will initially be a smaller version of the organ, he explains, but could eventually help pharmaceutical companies bypass testing trial drugs on animals, he says. And ultimately, bioprinting organs from people's own cells will solve the ""huge lack of supply"" in organs for transplant, says Mr Morris, and do away with the need for anti-rejection immunosuppressant drugs. Specialist printers could even reproduce cancers tumours, giving doctors the chance to test ""which treatment could specifically work on that patient,"" says Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Swedish start-up Cellink. Bioprinters are becoming more sophisticated as the technology develops His firm has been given a â¬2.5m ($2.9m; Â£2.2m) grant from the European Union to develop these tumour-modelling printers. Bioprinters also give us a way of ""quickly laying down small quantities of fluid to test if a new antibiotic would work for that specific patient,"" says Annette Friskopp, vice president for specialty printing systems at the large tech firm HP in Palo Alto. This could help tackle the growing and serious problem of antimicrobial resistance - the rise of ""superbugs"" traditional antibiotics can't kill. HP is partnering with the US Center for Disease Control to deploy printers in four regional labs in the US this autumn. Printers of any kind need ink, and bioprinters are no different. ""Bioink"" is a gel that can be extruded through a printing nozzle and mimics the suspension lying between cells, called the extracellular matrix. Both university labs and start-ups, such as Cellink, have been developing bioinks that can be used with many types of cells, says Ahu Arslan Yildiz, a biochemist who heads a research group at Izmir Institute of Technology in western Turkey. Ahu Arslan Yildiz holds up a bioprinted cancer tumour And these ""universal"" bioinks are growing more and more ""processable and easy to handle,"" says Ms Yildiz, while also not being toxic. Another breakthrough in the fast-developing field comes from Japan. Most bioprinting uses a scaffold to hold cells in place. And once cells are ""coaxed to a certain level, they begin to self organise and assemble,"" says Arnold Kriegstein, director of the stem cells and regeneration medicine centre at the University of California, San Francisco. The scaffold can then be removed. Are 'swipe left' dating apps bad for our mental health? The race to make the world's most powerful computer ever 'My robot makes me feel like I haven't been forgotten' How did Coca-Cola put fizz into its World Cup sales? Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency But Koichi Nakayama, at Saga University in southern Japan, has been developing a way to create 3D tissue without scaffolds. Instead, he lances small spheres on a fine array of needles, called a kenzan. Dr Nakayama, a doctor and chairman of the university's Regenerative Medicine and Biomedical Engineering department, is now ""preparing the first human trial in our university"" to implant dialysis tubes ""just made from a patient's own skin cells"". So bioprinting is making huge strides and promising to give many of us a new lease of life.

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong A powerful storm which killed dozens of people in the Philippines is now making its way across southern China. Typhoon Mangkhut is one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in decades. Two people have been killed in the Chinese province of Guangdong, according to state media - more than 2.5 million people have been evacuated in Guangdong and on Hainan island. In Hong Kong, the storm wrecked buildings and shut down the city. The typhoon is now moving inland, and is expected to hit the Chinese regions of Guizhou, Chongqing and Yunnan later in the day. In the Philippines, 33 miners have been confirmed dead and at least 29 are missing after a landslide hit a mining site in Itogon in Benguet province, according to local reports. Search and rescue missions are continuing, and there are fears the death toll could rise above 100, said Itogon's mayor, Victorio Palangdan. Families move to safer ground after landslides hit Itogon town in Benguet province People caught outside as the worst of the storm approached were photographed overwhelmed by conditions In Hong Kong, which was hit hard over the weekend, videos on social media showed apartments swaying in the wind, scaffolding crashing to the ground and commercial buildings with windows shattered. Transport services have also been suspended, with flights cancelled, trains stopped and major roads closed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon. In pictures: Deadly typhoon hits China Officials put the number of injured in Hong Kong at more than 200. Despite avoiding a direct hit, winds there reached more than 110mph and as water levels surged by almost 3.5m (12ft) in places. Authorities had issued their maximum alert, warning residents to stay indoors and away from windows to avoid flying debris. Most shops and public services were shut, and about 900 flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport. A resident living in a high-rise in the city told Reuters news agency she could feel her building swaying in the storm. ""It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours,"" Elaine Wong said. ""It made me feel so dizzy."" In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history, the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. The heavy winds smashed in windows in some Hong Kong high-rises Downtown roads were pictured deluged with water, stranding vehicles The storm ploughed across the main Philippine island of Luzon over the weekend.

Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? The BBC's Howard Johnson in the Philippines described a trail of destruction along the northern coast of Luzon with forests ripped to shreds and electricity poles felled. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited the badly affected area of Tuguegarao on Sunday There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Preparation and evacuation procedures have improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

"Dozens of people have told BBC Scotland they were abused at the home Decades of physical cruelty and child sex abuse allegations at a children's home in Argyll have been uncovered by a BBC investigation. The claims centre around Lagarie Children's Home in Rhu, Argyll, run by the Sailors' Society charity. More than a dozen people have told the BBC they were abused at the home, many of them sexually, by staff there. The Sailors' Society says it ""apologises unreservedly that this abuse happened"". Between 1949 and 1982, hundreds of children were sent to live at Lagarie. They were the children of seafarers taken in by the Sailors Society, a Christian charity supporting the families of men working at sea. The programme,Disclosure: Suffer The Children, to be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 22:40 on Mondaytells the harrowing stories of the victims of abuse during two separate regimes at the home. The Rev William Barrie has been accused of raping victims hundreds of times and his wife Mary of physical abuse Angela Montgomery and her sisters Mary and Norma were at the home because their mother had died young and their father was at sea. They told the BBC they were subjected to sustained sexual abuse after the Rev William Barrie and his wife Mary took charge of the home in 1972. The sisters who survived the evil at Lagarie - BBC News The Montgomery sisters said that over the years at Lagarie they were raped hundreds of times by Mr Barrie and physically abused by his wife. This video can not be played Angela Montgomery tells of abuse at Lagarie Children's Home Angela, now 56, said: ""After a while, even as unpleasant as it wasâ¦not that you got used to it, you just thoughtâ¦ there was no point struggling or fightingâ¦ you know. You justâ¦ it was this level of acceptance of, it became part and parcel of life at Lagarie."" Angela tells the programme children were taken away from Lagarie to conventions to be abused by people associated with Mr Barrie and the Sailors' Society. The Montgomery sisters left Lagarie more than 40 years ago and each of them has struggled with mental health problems. Matron Anne Millar pictured with with Roddy Austin Roddy Austin said he lived in fear after being abused at the home During an earlier regime which Disclosure has investigated, the allegations centred on Anne Millar, the matron of the home who professed to be a devout Christian but Roddy Austin, one of the former residents, said he lived in fear at Lagarie. Roddy, 61, said: ""Unless you've lived it, you can't experience it, you can't try to fathom what went on in that placeâ¦she was evil."" Philip Donald, now 58, was in the home for about two and a half years. He says Ms Millar used to pick him up by the ears, throw him into a cold bath and put her soap-covered fingers down his throat. Both Roddy and Philip say they were sexually abused by the Lagarie gardener, Norman Skelton. Philip told the programme, ""He raped me. Over and over again."" Philip Donald said the matron put soap-covered fingers down his throat Mr Skelton died in 1999. Anne Millar retired from the home 1970 and is also now dead. The Montgomery sisters and others gave statements to the old Strathclyde police force about the abuse in the early 2000s but no-one was charged. A second police investigation, prompted by the Sailors Society, concluded in 2016. Mrs Barrie was questioned, and a report sent to the fiscal, but she was never charged. She died in late 2017. William Barrie died in 1993 without ever having to answer any questions about the allegedly large-scale and organised abuse of children in his care. Stuart Rivers said the charity apologised unreservedly that the abuse happened Stuart Rivers, chief executive of the Southampton-based charity which has the Queen as its patron, was interviewed for the programme and apologised for the abuse that happened. He said: ""I was horrified when I heard these accounts. We do regret any abuse happened and we have apologised unreservedly that this abuse happened."" Asked if the charity takes full responsibility for the abuse that took place, he said: ""I think we have to take some responsibility. I want to see a satisfactory outcome for all who have been affected by this."" He added that the charity is providing counselling for Lagarie survivors. Patrick McGuire, of Thompson's Solicitors, represents some former residents of Lagarie in civil cases against the Sailors' Society. He said: ""The abuse is on an entirely different scale from anything else that we've seen. ""The simple fact is that nobody was looking out for these kids."" Patrick McGuire said the abuse was on a different scale from anything else he had seen Mr Rivers said: ""We have co-operated fully with police and the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and have written to all former residents we have had any contact with to date, apologising for any abuse suffered and encouraging them to make contact with police and the inquiry if they felt able to do so."" The charity opposed the Scottish government's plans to end the Time Bar law preventing victims of historical abuse from bringing civil actions. It said it believed a government-led redress scheme, which is under consideration, was the best solution. Mr Rivers added: ""Nobody involved in these historic events is connected in any way with the organisation now. We are no longer involved in running this, or any other children's home, and today we have rigorous safeguarding measures in place."" Police sent a file to the crown in 2016 about Mrs Barrie and one other man in relation to Lagarie. No charges were brought. A Crown Office spokesperson said: ""Following full and careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the currently available admissible evidence, Crown Counsel instructed that there should be no proceedings at this time. ""The Crown reserves the right to raise proceedings should further evidence become available."" Disclosure will share the results of its investigation to the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry which last week announced that Lagarie has now been added to the list of residential homes it will probe.
