"Final score: Rams 23-20 Bengals Cooper Kupp scores two TDs - including winning score - as he is named Super Bowl MVP Bengals QB Joe Burrow brought down by Aaron Donald in dying seconds to seal Rams' second Super Bowl victory Rams lose wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr to knee injury in first half Get involved: #BBCNFL Paul Higham and Ben Collins Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals What a season it's been, and what a victory that was for the Los Angeles Rams inside their own SoFi Stadium. They dominated early, lost Odell Beckham to injury, then were rocked by an early second-half blitz by the Cincinnati Bengals. Aaron Donald and the defence stopped Joe Burrow in his tracks though before Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp led the game-winning drive late one. It means vindication for owner Stan Kroenke for moving the team back to LA, splashing out 5bn on this stadium and sanctioning their ambitious plans of assembling their star-studded squad. Read our full report on Super Bowl 56and watch out for more highlights and reaction on the website. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Sean McVay is the youngest head coach ever to win a Super Bowl, and have his side just shown a new way to go about bringing success in the NFL? They've gone against the grain and used their draft picks in trades for older, established stars, and being fine with missing out on first round college players. It's hard to argue when Von Miller and Matthew Stafford both had such a huge impact on the game, while the free agent they brought in Odell Beckham Jr was also starring before he got injured. They say it's a copycat league in the NFL, so will teams try and win the Super Bowl the Rams way from now on? Watch this space. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Well, there we have it - the team built to win a Super Bowl claims the trophy in their stadium built to host it. It has kind of a nice ring to it as the Los Angeles Rams get their Hollywood ending to the season. They paid a high price for Matthew Stafford but their QB stepped up when he needed to right at the end, along with two players they drafted - Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald. It was a fine effort by Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and the Bengals, who also played well on defence, but their downfall was exactly where we expected it to be - protecting Burrow. Burrow was sacked seven times tonight - and even with his obvious talents he just didn't have enough time to respond. You get the sense Burrow will be back though, and the Rams just about deserved to win overall. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Cooper Kupp has been a revelation this season and been the dominant receiver in the NFL - in just his first season playing with new QB Matthew Stafford. He could be even better next season... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Matthew Staffordcame up huge in the fourth quarter making big throws in big moments, including the game-winning pass to Cooper Kupp. But he was full of praise for his team-mates following the win. ""I am so proud of this team,"" he said. ""There are so many guys that deserve this, so many guys who have given their hearts and souls to this team. ""I just thank for coach [McVay] for saying you and Cooper Kupp go and get this thing done and calling plays for him. ""Kept finding ways to get him the ball, and he kept making unbelievable plays, that is what he does."" Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Rams owner Stan Kroenke lifts the Lombardi Trophy: ""Building this stadium didn't turn out too badly,"" he says. Wonder if Arsenal fans are celebrating Kroenke's success? Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Aaron Donaldwas a menace all game, and sealed the victory with that final sack on Joe Burrow. He's won plenty of individual honours but has always wanted a Super Bowl ring. ""I'm just so happy, I wanted this so bad, I feel amazing,"" Donald said on the field. ""It was one last play to be world champs, and we made a play and won so that's all that matters. ""This is the best feeling in the world, I don't know what to say."" There was talk of Donald retiring if the Rams won the Super Bowl, but he's not thinking about anything but celebrating. ""I'm in the moment, I just want to enjoy this right now with these guys and my kids and live in the moment for now."" Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals That's the end of the game, and the Los Angeles Rams become the second straight team to win the Super Bowl in their home stadium after a tough old battle with the Cincinnati Bengals. It was mainly a defensive scuffle but that final drive led by Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp, then the final play aptly from Aaron Donald sealed a hard-fought victory. The Rams built this team for this moment, and they delivered when they had to.

"TV producer Beryl Vertue, whose company created the series Men Behaving Badly and Sherlock, has died aged 90. The media executive, who rose to the top of the industry after starting as a secretary, ""passed away peacefully"" on Saturday, her family said. Industry colleagues called her one of the most influential women in British TV. Daughters Sue and Debbie, producers at the company their mother founded, said: ""She meant so much to so many."" Vertue's career began when she was asked by the writers of Steptoe and Son, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, to type up their scripts. In the mid-1950s, she began representing figures such as sitcom scriptwriter Johnny Speight and comedian Frankie Howerd, in effect becoming a talent agent. She also had success selling shows such as Til Death Us Do Part and Steptoe and Son to the US market. In 1979, she founded Hartswood films, producing a series of shows including the 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, which starred Martin Clunes, Neil Morrissey, Leslie Ash and Caroline Quentin. Her company was also behind the critically acclaimed drama Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch, produced by Vertue and her daughter Sue, who is married to the series co-creator Steven Moffat. Sue and Debbie said in a statement that their mother had remained sharp until the end of her life, continuing to grill her daughters about work in her final days. Vertue was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch in 2016 ""I know we're not alone in thinking that somehow she'd go on forever. She meant so much to so many,"" they said. ""She wasn't just our mum, she was our best friend, our mentor, our adviser, our role model, our holiday companion, our giggle-maker and our boss!"" They said that ""she was often the last person at a party, she didn't suffer fools, she was fair, she was kind, she was fun, she was stubborn, in fact she was the total package and we will miss her beyond words"". ""She was more than a mother to us - she was also a friend. To many in the industry she was more than a friend - she was often a mother,"" her daughters added. Writer and actor Mark Gatiss - who co-created Sherlock and played the detective's brother, Mycroft - paid tribute to her ""extraordinary legacy"", from helping to type out scripts for the Goon Show to representing Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks. ""She saw it all and did most of it,"" he said. ""But foremost - a wonderful woman, a loyal colleague and an absolute scream. She was loved."" Vertue produced the hit 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, whose stars included Leslie Ash Actor and comedian Dawn French called her ""mighty and marvellous"" and said her death was ""a huge loss"". Charlotte Moore, the BBC's chief content officer, said Vertue was ""one of the most influential women in British broadcasting"" who ""literally helped shape the TV industry as we know it today"". Vertue was made an OBE in 2000 and a CBE in 2016 for her work in the TV industry. She also received a series of industry awards, including Bafta's Alan Clarke award for outstanding creative contribution to television in 2004. In March 2012 she was recognised for her lifetime achievement at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards, and in 2016 she was presented with a similar award from Cumberbatch at the Women in Film and TV Awards.

"Elizabeth, 10, had her first Covid jab on Sunday Clinically vulnerable five to 11-year-olds are being encouraged to get Covid vaccinations by a health board. Elizabeth, 10, who had her first vaccine on Sunday, said the jab ""looks kind of fierce, but it isn't"". Betsi Cadwaladr University health board is also offering inoculation to children the same age who share a home with someone at risk. The decision was made in December to offer jabs to eligible children in that age group. But vaccination centres still want more to get jabbed. Deputy nurse manager at Llandudno's Sector House vaccination centre, Nia Williams, said uptake has been ""slow but steady"" since invites were sent. Heart surgery Wales: Calls for child operations to resume Children asked 'are you much too fat' in survey Jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds 'for children and parents to decide' ""It's a big decision for parents to bring their child,"" she said. ""It takes time to make a good decision, the right decision for your child... they are maybe still stalling it or still thinking about it. ""Our view is that the children should be vaccinated."" Elizabeth was given a certificate after the inoculation was done Elizabeth, of Conwy county, was one of three children who visited the Llandudno clinic for her first vaccine on Sunday. The type 1 diabetes patient believes other children should also get jabbed. The 10-year-old said: ""It didn't hurt, you could just feel it was there. ""I blinked and it was over... A lot of the time you get injections when you go to hospital and it stings so much."" Elizabeth said having the vaccine means she will be able to visit her grandparents in Canada in summer. Betsi Cadwaladr health board is offering vaccinations at Llandudno's Sector House Ms Williams said they were trying to make the experience ""easy and child friendly"". ""We want them to come back for their second vaccine,"" she said. Betsi Cadwaladr health board in north Wales is holding the clinics for at risk 5- 11 year olds at weekends during term time.

"Gareth Hughes received a cheque for more than Â£2.3tn An energy firm has apologised after 74 customers hit by power cuts during Storm Arwen accidentally received compensation cheques for trillions of pounds. Northern Powergrid is paying tens of thousands of pounds to customers hit by days of outages in November. But a number with Halifax and Newcastle postcodes received cheques made out for 13-figure sums. Northern Powergrid said a clerical error was to blame. Pictures of the erroneous cheques have been circulating on social media days after the firmwas criticised for taking months to process compensation claims. Gareth Hughes, 44, from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, shared a picture of his cheque for more than Â£2.3tn. Mr Hughes, who was without power for more than three days, said he had been sent a previous cheque for Â£135 but had complained as he was told he was entitled to more. He said the new cheque made him smile, adding: ""But I knew it wasn't a value that could be realistic."" Mr Hughes was without power for more than three days during Storm Arwen A spokeswoman for Northern Powergrid said an electricity meter reference was incorrectly quoted as the payment sum. ""As soon as we identified the clerical error we ensured all 74 customers' cheques were stopped so they could not be cashed,"" she said. The firm said the error was being investigated and is thought to be an isolated incident. ""We thank those customers who were honest and contacted us and we have been making contact directly over the weekend with all 74 customers affected to make them aware, apologise for the error and reassure them that a correct payment will be issued to them on Monday,"" the spokeswoman said. The winds of Strom Arwen brought down trees and power lines across the network causing mass power outages, with some properties in Northumberland and County Durhamtaking more than a week to be reconnected.

"This video can not be played The humble sheepdog has been an integral part of British farm life for centuries, but never before have they commanded so much respect - or money. The past two years has seen unprecedented prices recorded for specially bred and trained dogs at agricultural marts. Many of the top dogs are now coming from Wales, including a border collie called Kim from Ceredigion,which sold for a world record Â£27,000 last February. Sheep farmer and dog-handler Emrys Jones, from Barmouth in Gwynedd, said he regularly fields calls from across the world asking about his dogs, with 40 going abroad to places such as South Korea, Japan, Australia, Norway and the USA at a recent sale. ""The old boys wouldn't believe what's happening nowadays,"" he said. Michael Priestley of Farmers Weekly said: ""Better dogs cost more but better dogs make the job of gathering in sheep much quicker and they minimise labour cost.

"Police moved in on the remaining protesters in large numbers on Sunday morning Police have cleared the remaining protesters blocking a key bridge between Canada and the United States, after a week of disruption. Canada's protests against Covid vaccine certification to cross the border have paralysed trade across the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario. A judge issued an order on Friday to break up the protest, but dozens of demonstrators remained in defiance. Police have now cleared the road, though the bridge remains closed. In a statement, police said Sunday's action resulted in over a dozen arrests on a charge of mischief - which refers to damage or interference with property. Multiple vehicles were also seized, police said, none of the arrests became violent. The clearing effort first began on Saturday morning, when many of the vehicles involved left peacefully on police orders. But as news of the police action spread, more protesters turned up, temporarily swelling the crowd. But by Sunday morning, only a few dozen people remained, and police resumed their operation. Within hours, only a small number of stragglers remained on the sidelines, though police vehicles, rather than protesters, continue to block off the road to the Ambassador Bridge. Windsor police warned people to avoid the area of the bridge, tweeting: ""Enforcement will continue in the demonstration area and there will be zero tolerance for illegal activity."" Officials say they hope to reopen the bridge later on Sunday. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor The police came to oust the remaining protesters in the early cold of Sunday morning, putting an end to the blockade that had ground traffic on one of Canada's most important trade routes to a halt for nearly a week. Their numbers had dwindled overnight from a couple hundred protesters on Saturday to just about 30 stalwarts willing to brave the -17C (1F) temperature over night. Police had erected concrete barricades, effectively boxing their encampments - located south of the Ambassador Bridge - and surrounded them in tactical gear. ""Nobody is doing anything there. We're all just standing there with our Canadian flags, we want freedom"", protester Tyler Kok told the BBC. ""I heard one of the cops say 'we're taking the trucks first' so I mean that's kind of the beginning of the end. I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" he added. That protest had already cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade. About a kilometre down the road, after breaking up Mr Kok and his friends, police moved in to end a second small encampment. Horns honked loud in protest, but with police far outnumbering protesters, their noise was a swan song, not a rallying cry. The protest has inspired others around the world to stage similar action, in a bid to congest city roads and attract attention - such as in France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. AT THE SCENE:After police raid, what next for Canada protests? ANALYSIS:Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Paris saw hundreds of vehicles converge on the cityfrom around France on Saturday, in a self-styled Freedom Convoy which aimed to disrupt traffic in protest against the use of Covid passes to enter bars, restaurants, and public spaces. Hundreds of motorists were fined over the banned protests, and dozens of people were arrested amid volleys of tear gas near the Champs-ElysÃ©es. Many protesters planned to move on to Brussels - home to several key EU institutions - to join up with a wider European movement based on the Canadian demonstrations.

"Cardiff Bus unveiled its new electric fleet in January A plan to move the whole of Wales' bus fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2035 needs a nationwide funding plan, operators have said. Unlike England and Scotland, Wales does not yet have a government-run fund to help operators with the cost of green vehicles and infrastructure. Newport and Cardiff have made big steps in bringing electric buses into use, but they are the outliers at present. Work on a funding scheme is happening this year, the Welsh government said. Cardiff Bus unveiled 36 new electric buses in January, which means zero emission (ZE) vehicles now make up almost a quarter of its fleet, four years after the first eight-week trial of an electric bus in the city. Why did we shun electric buses 50 years ago? Dual nationality: Same country but roads apart On board Wales' first electric bus Newport was the first place in Wales to install apermanent electric service busin 2019. Newport Bus hopes to be running half its fleet with electric buses by the end of 2022 Newport Transport introduced the country's first electric fleet of buses in 2020 to take its total to 16, and is expecting a further 16 in March. It hopes to have half its 100-strong fleet switched to electric this year. But these are the only two significant ZE fleets in Wales. Even Swansea, Wales' second largest city, has no provision and the council is not aware of any plans by private operators in the city to change this. Welsh government has pledged to switch allTrawsCymru,externallong-distance services to ZE by2026 The 50% most polluting buses will be replaced by ZE buses by2028 Deadline for all public service buses to be zero-tailpipe emission (no fossil fuels on board)2035 John Dowie, director of partnerships at First UK, which owns First Cymru, said Wales had benefitted from some of the UK government schemes, which had supplied funding for the Cardiff and Newport buses, but it had always been ""on the margins trying to make the best of someone else's scheme"". ""I think it's time for Wales to set up its own scheme that's suited to Welsh circumstances and drive its own agenda, not just wait to pick up the crumbs from England,"" he added. He estimated the cost of investment from the Welsh government to convert all buses would run to ""tens of millions every year, spread over a number of years"", but this would be accompanied by operators investing similar amounts. All TrawsCymru services are due to be zero emission by 2026 Six electric buses are planned for a new TrawsCymru T22 route in Gwynedd between Blaenau Ffestiniog, Porthmadog and Caernarfon, and along the T19 Blaenau Ffestiniog to Llandudno route. Another eight are in the pipeline for the T1 service between Carmarthen and Aberystwyth. Following a Â£4.8m Welsh government grant, Carmarthenshire council is seeking planning permission to build a new electric charging depot to power TrawsCymru. How will bus operators manage? First Cymru boss Jane Reakes-Davies said public transport had to be seen as a better option First Cymru, which operates in south and west Wales, has committed to the 2035 zero-emission deadline. Chief executive Jane Reakes-Davies pointed to the planned TrawsCymru Carmarthen to Aberystwyth services as an example of how electric buses could place extra financial demands on operators. The diesel service is run with five buses, but will need eight electric buses, plus charging points, to maintain the level of service. Mr Dowie said approximately one Â£30,000 charger was needed for every two buses, as well as cables to connect them to the grid and the more expensive parts for electric and hydrogen buses. ""It makes investing in zero unaffordable on most routes, so that's where we need a partnership with government to help with the extra costs, not the underlying cost that we would have had to spend anyway for diesel [buses],"" he added. Newport Bus has said it was ""imperative that government takes its place in the assisted funding of zero emission bus schemes"" found in all other parts of the UK. Operator Stagecoach agreed, with the company's Emma Knight pointing to the ""unfortunate"" lack of a funding in Wales to match England'sZebra,externalplan or Scotland'slow-emission bus,externalscheme. She said: ""Electric vehicles are significantly more expensive than non-electric buses and government support is a key part of securing the transition to cleaner fleets. ""[But] there is a far bigger opportunity to address climate change and improve local air quality by encouraging people to move out of their cars to more sustainable public transport and active travel."" This point has also been made by Prof Mark Barry, architect of theSouth Wales Metro. He said the biggest decarbonisation impact came not from how the buses were powered (although that helped) but by ""getting thousands of people out of their cars and on to public transport"". Ms Reakes-Davies added things such as priority bus lanes also helped persuade passengers. ""If you're on a bus and you're just sitting in a stream of cars, there's no advantage, whereas if it is a more speedy journey by bus then you will be inclined to go by bus,"" she said. The pandemic has had a big impact on behaviour, with more people using cars because of Covid fears, increasing congestion. She said public transport had to be more appealing in order to be able to invest in having clean vehicles on the road. However, it is possible that introducing electric buses could accelerate the shift towards bus use as they were ""definitely more appealing"" to the public, according to Bus Users UK's director for Wales Barclay Davies. ""I just think there's an acceptance that we've probably reached tipping point - we can't go on adding more and more cars to the road and more congestion,"" he said. Travelling on a well-equipped, quiet electric bus was ""certainly a better experience"" for passengers compared to bus travel a few decades ago. Despite the current higher costs of ZE buses, there had not been rises in the cost of tickets as a result in areas of the UK where electric buses had been brought in, he stressed. ""The costs [of buying ZE buses] should go down over time so the hope is as manufacturing scales up, the cost of vehicles will reduce. ""But operators tell us at the moment because of the price differential they are looking to governments to help them make the transmission,"" he added. Mr Davies said initiatives such as free bus transport before Christmas in Swansea, Cardiff and Newport, and a month-longfree bus travel pilot in Newport,externalrunning next month, could really help give potential passengers a chance to ""give it a go"". A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Over the next year we will work with the public sector to create a funding scheme to support the transition to electric buses. ""In the meantime, we have provided grants to local authorities for projects that will see zero emission buses replace diesel buses on major Welsh routes.""

"Friends ended in 2004 after 10 seasons but has remained hugely popular worldwide since then Several Chinese streaming platforms have been accused of censoring LGBT plotlines from hit US sitcom Friends. The show was re-released in China earlier this week on Tencent, Bilibili, Sohu, iQiyi and Alibaba's Youku. But Chinese fans have complained of scenes being deleted, including those that reference a lesbian character, and another featuring a same-sex kiss. It is unclear why the scenes have been removed, and none of the platforms have responded publicly to the accusations. The show, which ran from 1994-2004, is based in New York City and centres around a group of friends played by Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. Friends has a massive following in China, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with teaching them English and introducing them to US culture. Sohu held broadcast rights between 2012 and 2018, and aired full, uncensored episodes at the time. China TV blurs Western brands over Xinjiang cotton Can Western brands recover in China after backlash? China changes Fight Club film ending But Chinese fans shared their dismay on social media about the re-release and its omissions. In one instance, dialogue was axed about the ex-wife of one character, Ross, who left him after she realised she was a lesbian. Incorrect subtitles were also used to downplay sexual references, the South China Morning Post reports. In one scene, the phrase ""multiple orgasms"" was translated to the Chinese phrase for ""women have endless gossips"". ""Not only does it ignore women's sexual desire and enjoyment... [it] also reinforces the gender stereotype of women,"" one user wrote on social media site Weibo, according to CNN. ""If you can't show the complete version under the current atmosphere, then don't import it,"" wrote another. Several users have called for a boycott of the show in protest. The hashtag #FriendsCensored has became a popular term on Weibo in recent days. But on Sunday, searches for the hashtag and other variations produced either zero or limited results - indicating discussions may have caught the attention of Chinese censors. Lady Gaga's appearance at a Friends reunion was cut from Chinese broadcasts last year In recent years, China has shut down tens of thousands of websites and social media accounts containing ""vulgar"" and pornographic content, and other material deemed illegal or anti-Chinese. Scenes featuring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and K-Pop band BTS were cut froma Friends reunion special aired last year. It's unclear why the musicians were removed from the final broadcast, but all three have previously been accused of insulting China. Lady Gaga, for example, has been banned from touring in the country after meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016.

"TV producer Beryl Vertue, whose company created the series Men Behaving Badly and Sherlock, has died aged 90. The media executive, who rose to the top of the industry after starting as a secretary, ""passed away peacefully"" on Saturday, her family said. Industry colleagues called her one of the most influential women in British TV. Daughters Sue and Debbie, producers at the company their mother founded, said: ""She meant so much to so many."" Vertue's career began when she was asked by the writers of Steptoe and Son, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, to type up their scripts. In the mid-1950s, she began representing figures such as sitcom scriptwriter Johnny Speight and comedian Frankie Howerd, in effect becoming a talent agent. She also had success selling shows such as Til Death Us Do Part and Steptoe and Son to the US market. In 1979, she founded Hartswood films, producing a series of shows including the 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, which starred Martin Clunes, Neil Morrissey, Leslie Ash and Caroline Quentin. Her company was also behind the critically acclaimed drama Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch, produced by Vertue and her daughter Sue, who is married to the series co-creator Steven Moffat. Sue and Debbie said in a statement that their mother had remained sharp until the end of her life, continuing to grill her daughters about work in her final days. Vertue was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch in 2016 ""I know we're not alone in thinking that somehow she'd go on forever. She meant so much to so many,"" they said. ""She wasn't just our mum, she was our best friend, our mentor, our adviser, our role model, our holiday companion, our giggle-maker and our boss!"" They said that ""she was often the last person at a party, she didn't suffer fools, she was fair, she was kind, she was fun, she was stubborn, in fact she was the total package and we will miss her beyond words"". ""She was more than a mother to us - she was also a friend. To many in the industry she was more than a friend - she was often a mother,"" her daughters added. Writer and actor Mark Gatiss - who co-created Sherlock and played the detective's brother, Mycroft - paid tribute to her ""extraordinary legacy"", from helping to type out scripts for the Goon Show to representing Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks. ""She saw it all and did most of it,"" he said. ""But foremost - a wonderful woman, a loyal colleague and an absolute scream. She was loved."" Vertue produced the hit 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, whose stars included Leslie Ash Actor and comedian Dawn French called her ""mighty and marvellous"" and said her death was ""a huge loss"". Charlotte Moore, the BBC's chief content officer, said Vertue was ""one of the most influential women in British broadcasting"" who ""literally helped shape the TV industry as we know it today"". Vertue was made an OBE in 2000 and a CBE in 2016 for her work in the TV industry. She also received a series of industry awards, including Bafta's Alan Clarke award for outstanding creative contribution to television in 2004. In March 2012 she was recognised for her lifetime achievement at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards, and in 2016 she was presented with a similar award from Cumberbatch at the Women in Film and TV Awards.

"Police moved in on the remaining protesters in large numbers on Sunday morning Police have cleared the remaining protesters blocking a key bridge between Canada and the United States, after a week of disruption. Canada's protests against Covid vaccine certification to cross the border have paralysed trade across the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario. A judge issued an order on Friday to break up the protest, but dozens of demonstrators remained in defiance. Police have now cleared the road, though the bridge remains closed. In a statement, police said Sunday's action resulted in over a dozen arrests on a charge of mischief - which refers to damage or interference with property. Multiple vehicles were also seized, police said, none of the arrests became violent. The clearing effort first began on Saturday morning, when many of the vehicles involved left peacefully on police orders. But as news of the police action spread, more protesters turned up, temporarily swelling the crowd. But by Sunday morning, only a few dozen people remained, and police resumed their operation. Within hours, only a small number of stragglers remained on the sidelines, though police vehicles, rather than protesters, continue to block off the road to the Ambassador Bridge. Windsor police warned people to avoid the area of the bridge, tweeting: ""Enforcement will continue in the demonstration area and there will be zero tolerance for illegal activity."" Officials say they hope to reopen the bridge later on Sunday. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor The police came to oust the remaining protesters in the early cold of Sunday morning, putting an end to the blockade that had ground traffic on one of Canada's most important trade routes to a halt for nearly a week. Their numbers had dwindled overnight from a couple hundred protesters on Saturday to just about 30 stalwarts willing to brave the -17C (1F) temperature over night. Police had erected concrete barricades, effectively boxing their encampments - located south of the Ambassador Bridge - and surrounded them in tactical gear. ""Nobody is doing anything there. We're all just standing there with our Canadian flags, we want freedom"", protester Tyler Kok told the BBC. ""I heard one of the cops say 'we're taking the trucks first' so I mean that's kind of the beginning of the end. I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" he added. That protest had already cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade. About a kilometre down the road, after breaking up Mr Kok and his friends, police moved in to end a second small encampment. Horns honked loud in protest, but with police far outnumbering protesters, their noise was a swan song, not a rallying cry. The protest has inspired others around the world to stage similar action, in a bid to congest city roads and attract attention - such as in France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.

"Gareth Hughes received a cheque for more than Â£2.3tn An energy firm has apologised after 74 customers hit by power cuts during Storm Arwen accidentally received compensation cheques for trillions of pounds. Northern Powergrid is paying tens of thousands of pounds to customers hit by days of outages in November. But a number with Halifax and Newcastle postcodes received cheques made out for 13-figure sums. Northern Powergrid said a clerical error was to blame. Pictures of the erroneous cheques have been circulating on social media days after the firmwas criticised for taking months to process compensation claims. Gareth Hughes, 44, from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, shared a picture of his cheque for more than Â£2.3tn. Mr Hughes, who was without power for more than three days, said he had been sent a previous cheque for Â£135 but had complained as he was told he was entitled to more. He said the new cheque made him smile, adding: ""But I knew it wasn't a value that could be realistic."" Mr Hughes was without power for more than three days during Storm Arwen A spokeswoman for Northern Powergrid said an electricity meter reference was incorrectly quoted as the payment sum. ""As soon as we identified the clerical error we ensured all 74 customers' cheques were stopped so they could not be cashed,"" she said. The firm said the error was being investigated and is thought to be an isolated incident. ""We thank those customers who were honest and contacted us and we have been making contact directly over the weekend with all 74 customers affected to make them aware, apologise for the error and reassure them that a correct payment will be issued to them on Monday,"" the spokeswoman said. The winds of Strom Arwen brought down trees and power lines across the network causing mass power outages, with some properties in Northumberland and County Durhamtaking more than a week to be reconnected.

"Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay has said his appointment to chief of staff is ""an honour"" Government will take a ""step back"" from people's lives and pursue ""a smaller state"", the PM's new top aide has said. Steve Barclaytold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat while public health interventions and vast amounts spent in the pandemic were the right decisions, it was time for ""a more enabling approach"". The PMmade cabinet minister Mr Barclayhis new chief of staff last week. No 10 says the prime minister will focus on domestic policy on a tour of parts of the UK this week. It comes as Boris Johnson faces continued criticism and concern from some Conservative MPs about his leadership. Boris Johnson names two key aides What do key resignations mean for PM? Mr Barclay's appointment as chief of staff was part of a No 10 shake-up in the wake of civil servant Sue Gray's initial report into Downing Street lockdown parties, and the ongoing police investigation into gatherings. In his first public comments since then, Mr Barclay writes: ""Now it is a priority to restore a smaller state - both financially and in taking a step back from people's lives. ""It's time to return to a more enabling approach. To trust the people, return power to communities, and free up business to deliver."" As chief of staff, Mr Barclay is the prime minister's most senior advisor with, No 10 says, responsibility for ""driving the government's agenda more efficiently and ensuring it is better aligned with the cabinet and backbenchers"". The role is usually a political appointment rather than a civil servant position. Meanwhile, the prime minister has said he would be ""getting out of London"" this week to focus on ""the job of uniting and levelling up the country"". Mr Johnson will travel to Scotland to visit a manufacturing site and meet with workers. But the trip comes in the week he is required to respond to a police questionnaire about events in No 10 during lockdown. The Met Police has said the questions, which have been sent by email to more than 50 people, ""must be answered truthfully"" and should be responded to within seven days. The questionnaire has the same status as information given in an interview under caution. But being contacted does not mean a fine would always be issued, the police have said. Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said it would be ""very tough"" for Mr Johnson to cling on to power if he is fined. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he believed Mr Johnson would ""go on and fight the next election successfully"".

Mr Johnson will travel to Scotland to visit a manufacturing site and meet with workers. But the trip comes in the week he is required to respond to a police questionnaire about events in No 10 during lockdown. The Met Police has said the questions, which have been sent by email to more than 50 people, ""must be answered truthfully"" and should be responded to within seven days. The questionnaire has the same status as information given in an interview under caution. But being contacted does not mean a fine would always be issued, the police have said. Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said it would be ""very tough"" for Mr Johnson to cling on to power if he is fined. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he believed Mr Johnson would ""go on and fight the next election successfully"".

"Liudmyla Bobova was displaced to Kharkiv by the war. ""I can breathe freely here,"" she said. About half an hour's drive from the centre of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, in a low-rise industrial area of the city, there are rows of what look like white shipping containers set back from the main road and ringed by a blue metal fence. The rows of containers, blanketed by snow this time of year, are actually a village of temporary housing units for people who already fled the war in Ukraine once, back in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists seized much of the Donbas region by force. The residents of the ""module city"" live in remarkably cramped conditions - imagine a portable cabin you would see on a construction site, with low ceilings and strip lights, divided into a living room, kitchen and bathroom area and occupied by families of two or three or more. ""Yes, the accommodation is depressing,"" said Liudmyla Bobova, a resident who shares a private unit with her husband and elderly mother - a relative luxury compared with their previous unit where they occupied one small room in a communal unit, sleeping on bunk beds and sharing a kitchen and toilet. And yet Bobova and her family are grateful to be here, she said. ""There is occupation,"" she said, referring to the separatist territory they fled. ""Life there is grey, you cannot breathe freely. Here, I can breathe freely."" As for her change in living conditions, she only shrugged. ""That was one life, this is a another life,"" she said. In her previous life, Bobova lived in Molodohvardiisk, a small mining town a stone's throw from the Russian border, where there was little political activity and people were only absent-mindedly pro-Russian, she said. Her family fled the region along with thousands of others when the war began, escaping on foot and by train as shells fell ""like rumbling thunder"". Residents of Kharkiv's 'module city' live in dilapidated temporary units on the outskirts of the city. They ended up in the module city and have lived here since. The modules - paid for by the German government - had a maximum shelf life of three and a half years for human occupation, but seven years on about 175 people remain. ""There's nothing more constant than the temporary,"" said Artur Statsenko, who oversees the units for the local council. ""The state hasn't managed these people at all. For the past eight years we have not received anything from the state budget. We have a special Ministry for Reintegration but they have not given us a penny."" The BBC asked the Ministry for Reintegration - created in 2016 and tasked with caring for internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Donbas - to respond, but they declined to answer questions. For the IDPs, Russia's looming new threat to invade Ukraine brings the prospect of a double displacement. Their temporary homes, just 25 miles from the border, would be squarely in Russia's path. But an invasion appeared to be low down the list of concerns for the module city residents. ""We don't talk about the escalation, or the fact we might have to flee again,"" said Iryna Belinska, a 64-year-old grandmother of nine who lives in a unit with her unwell husband. ""We need a proper roof over our head, not a plastic little house,"" she said, gesturing to her broken ceiling and bowed floor. ""We have much more mundane things on our minds than war."" Iryna Belinska lives with her husband in a module. ""We don't talk about the escalation,"" she said. The war in eastern Ukraine has shifted the cultural identity of Kharkiv, a historically Russian-speaking city 300 miles from Kyiv but just 30 miles from the Russian border. Belinska spoke in Russian, but Bobova only speaks Ukrainian now. She abandoned Russian overnight in 2014 when she was was forced to flee her home - a kind of personal protest against the war. The separatists who seized Donbas attempted to seize Kharkiv too, and briefly they raised their flag on the regional government building in the city centre. The ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled here in search of political support, but he was met by street protests and fled again to Crimea, and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second most-populous city, remained undisputed. ""Kharkiv was always pro-Ukrainian,"" said Boris Redin, an avuncular lifelong ""Kharkiver"" who has operated a kind of pro-Ukraine protest tent opposite the local government building since 2014. ""But it has become more pro-Ukrainian since the war started, like every city,"" he said. ""If the Russians want to attack us, they are our guests, we are not afraid."" Kharkiv would be a logical destination for the Russians if they rolled over the border nearby, but Vladimir Putin's troops could face a grinding resistance from the population. Many have enrolled in volunteer battalions and trained to fight, and two weeks ago the city's streets filled with protesters again, this time chanting ""Kharkiv is Ukraine"" and ""stop Russian aggression"". ""People have joined the territorial defence, volunteers continue to go the warzone, all this is working,"" said Svitlana Gorbunova-Ruban, the deputy mayor of Kharkiv. ""We are ready to defend our city in any situation and by all means."" Boris Redin has operated a kind of pro-Ukraine protest tent opposite the local government building since 2014 There is a lot here to defend - 38 universities, museums, a thriving tech sector and vibrant contemporary arts scene. The celebrated Ukrainian writer Oksana Zabuzhko just finished a three-week residency here. ""There was an explosion of art in Kharkiv when the war began,"" said Natalia Ivanova, director of the city's institute of contemporary art. ""It was art of resistance, protest, non-acceptance."" Displaced artists and opera singers from Donetsk and Luhansk were invited to join theatre companies and opera productions in Kharkiv, said Svitlana Oleshko, a local theatre director. ""They were welcomed in Kharkiv,"" she said. ""This is a city of young people and they are more and more pro-Ukrainian and less and less Russian. They can see life in Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea and they don't want to live that way."" The war is felt here in a way it isn't in cities further west. Troops travel through Kharkiv on the way to the front and return to its hospitals wounded. Families have been estranged across a line that separates the city from the disputed territory, and the influx of people displaced from Donbas - somewhere between 120,000 and 350,000 - has brought its own divisions. How suicide became the hidden toll of the war in Ukraine There were ""undoubtedly cases of discrimination"" against the displaced when they arrived in Kharkiv, said Alla Feshchenko, the head of Station Kharkiv - a local non-governmental organisation. ""People refused to lease their apartments to them for example, because they were afraid they might turn out to be pro-Russian,"" she said. ""But other Kharkivers treated the IDPs wonderfully - they understood that we could have met the same fate, only we were luckier than Luhansk and Donetsk."" In the early days of the war, you would occasionally see cars driving around the city with fabric stretched across the roof or side bearing the world ""children"", Feshchenko said - a sign the car belonged to someone who had driven out of the disputed territory during the fighting. ""They didn't take the fabric off because they could not believe they were no longer under threat,"" she said. Washing hangs outside a the temporary units at the module city on the outskirts of Kharkiv. One thing was certain with regard to the displaced people who came to Kharkiv, Feshchenko said: the federal government had ""totally failed them"". ""The module city is the evilest evil,"" she said. ""People categorically should not be left in such a place. There was complete chaos there - fights, broken windows, showdowns, module vs module. It puts people on the bottom rung."" Gorbunova-Ruban, the deputy mayor, told the BBC the city had been sitting on finalised plans for four years for permanent housing on the site of the module city, after an agreement to split the costs 30% - 70% with the government, but the Ministry for Reintegration was yet to pay any of its part. This is the primary concern of the remaining residents of the module city - getting into proper accommodation. They would like to become real Kharkivers themselves. They hold occasional council meetings to discuss their concerns, and the minister for reintegration comes up more than the prospect of war. Liudmyla Bobova doesn't really miss Molodohvardiisk, she said. Some of her distant relatives are still there, and nothing they've told her makes her want to go back. ""Before the war, my life was full. But all I need here is my own home, and life will be full again,"" she said in Ukrainian. Daria Sipigina contributed to this report.

"No-campaign posters have sprung up warning: ""Today tobacco, tomorrow sausages?"" Swiss voters have backed a ban on tobacco advertising anywhere young people might see it. In effect, the Yes vote in the nationwide referendum will lead to a complete ban. The move will bring Switzerland into line with its European neighbours, most of whom adopted strict rules on tobacco advertising years ago. Despite its healthy, environmentally friendly image, Switzerland has the most lax rules on tobacco in Europe. Long after smoking in pubs and restaurants was outlawed in the UK, France, or Germany, the Swiss were still puffing away. Supermarket shoppers would regularly be approached by smiling young women giving away free samples of the latest cigarette brand. And while those things were banned a few years ago, tobacco advertising remained. Hailing Sunday's result, Social Democrat member of parliament Flavia Wasserfallen paid tribute to the doctors' and teachers' associations who campaigned for the ban. ""People worked really hard for policy that puts young people at its heart,"" she told Swiss television. The World Health Organization's historic Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was negotiated in Geneva almost 20 years ago. Switzerland signed it, but still has not ratified it - the only country in Europe not to - because its legislation on advertising was not, until Sunday's vote, compliant. Yes-campaign posters say more children smoke because of tobacco advertising Compared with much of Europe, cigarettes here are cheap and 27% of Swiss adults smoke - higher than the European average. Time and again legislation aimed at introducing tighter restrictions was rejected in parliament. And even after campaigners gathered enough signatures to force the referendum demanding a ban, the Swiss government recommended a No vote. Those backing the ban say that is down to the presence of the world's major tobacco companies here. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco all have their headquarters in Switzerland. The tobacco industry is estimated to contribute over $6bn (Â£4.5bn; â¬5bn) a year, and 11,000 jobs, to the Swiss economy. Just days before the vote it became clear - as many had suspected - that the tobacco companies had been funding the No campaign. Opponents argued a ban on advertising a legal product was unacceptable, and that it would open the door to restrictions on other things, like sugar or alcohol, judged to be harmful to health. Posters featuring some of Switzerland's favourite foods - cake and sausages - appeared with the bleak warning ""these will be next"". But voters were less than impressed by the campaign. Switzerland has 9,000 tobacco-related deaths each year and the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses is a drain on the health system. It also pushes up the cost of health insurance, which everyone has to pay, whether they are a smoker or not. 'Too much smoking in French films' One million French smokers quit in a year Swiss voters reject key climate change measures Ahead of the vote, opinion polls suggested more than 60% would back the ban. In the end that was reduced to 56%, but still a clear majority. ""The people understood that health is more important than economic interests,"" Stefanie de Borba of the Swiss League against Cancer told AFP news agency. Three other decisions went before Swiss voters on Sunday as well: on banning all animal testing, on more financial subsidies for the media, and on ending stamp duty for equity capital. All three were rejected. The animal testing was viewed as too limiting for Switzerland's world class medical research and development sector. The media subsidies were viewed by many voters as lining the pockets of media barons, while abolishing stamp duty would, voters thought, simply have made people who were already rich even richer. These are complex subjects for voters to decide on, but that is how Switzerland's system of direct democracy works. There is rule of thumb about how voters should decide if they feel they do not understand the issues: take the government's advice. But on Sunday the government urged a yes to media subsidies, and lost. It urged a yes to abolishing the stamp duty and lost, and it urged a no to the ban on tobacco advertising, and lost. Ministers may have to take some time to reflect on whether they are out of touch with voters. But as for tobacco, as one Swiss commentator put it on Sunday: ""In the choice between economic freedom and health, the majority of voters chose the latter... Whether it's advertising bans, smoking bans or more expensive cigarettes, smoking no longer has a lobby among the people - unlike among the politicians.""

"Police moved in on the remaining protesters in large numbers on Sunday morning Police have cleared the remaining protesters blocking a key bridge between Canada and the United States, after a week of disruption. Canada's protests against Covid vaccine certification to cross the border have paralysed trade across the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario. A judge issued an order on Friday to break up the protest, but dozens of demonstrators remained in defiance. Police have now cleared the road, though the bridge remains closed. In a statement, police said Sunday's action resulted in over a dozen arrests on a charge of mischief - which refers to damage or interference with property. Multiple vehicles were also seized, police said, none of the arrests became violent. The clearing effort first began on Saturday morning, when many of the vehicles involved left peacefully on police orders. But as news of the police action spread, more protesters turned up, temporarily swelling the crowd. But by Sunday morning, only a few dozen people remained, and police resumed their operation. Within hours, only a small number of stragglers remained on the sidelines, though police vehicles, rather than protesters, continue to block off the road to the Ambassador Bridge. Windsor police warned people to avoid the area of the bridge, tweeting: ""Enforcement will continue in the demonstration area and there will be zero tolerance for illegal activity."" Officials say they hope to reopen the bridge later on Sunday. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor The police came to oust the remaining protesters in the early cold of Sunday morning, putting an end to the blockade that had ground traffic on one of Canada's most important trade routes to a halt for nearly a week. Their numbers had dwindled overnight from a couple hundred protesters on Saturday to just about 30 stalwarts willing to brave the -17C (1F) temperature over night. Police had erected concrete barricades, effectively boxing their encampments - located south of the Ambassador Bridge - and surrounded them in tactical gear. ""Nobody is doing anything there. We're all just standing there with our Canadian flags, we want freedom"", protester Tyler Kok told the BBC. ""I heard one of the cops say 'we're taking the trucks first' so I mean that's kind of the beginning of the end. I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" he added. That protest had already cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade. About a kilometre down the road, after breaking up Mr Kok and his friends, police moved in to end a second small encampment. Horns honked loud in protest, but with police far outnumbering protesters, their noise was a swan song, not a rallying cry. The protest has inspired others around the world to stage similar action, in a bid to congest city roads and attract attention - such as in France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.

"This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump 24th Winter Olympic Games Hosts:Beijing, ChinaDates:4-20 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds; live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and mobile app Scrutiny of those around Kamila Valieva has increased after the World Anti-Doping Agency said it will investigate the adults working with the teenager. The 15-year-old Russian's failed drugs test has cast a dark cloud over the Beijing Winter Olympics, with her age prompting questions over how a child became embroiled in suspected doping. The figure skater was training in Beijing on Sunday, hours before a hearing to determine her Olympic fate. She came here tipped for women's gold. The European champion, whofailed a drugs testin December, will hear on Monday if she can compete in the individual women's event in Beijing on Tuesday. A lengthy hearing concluded on Sunday and a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) panel will decide whether to suspend her. ""It was a long hearing. Now the panel will deliberate until tomorrow morning, the end of the morning,"" said Matthieu Reeb, the general secretary of Cas. ""I cannot comment on anything at the hearing but I hope to give you a decision in a few hours."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had earlier called for global anti-doping body Wada to investigate her entourage. Hours later, Wada said it would ask its independent intelligence and investigations department to look into the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her. Kamila Valieva 'entourage' investigation would be welcome - IOC Valieva test puts Russia & doping in spotlight again Kamila Valieva's training has been watched by soft toys as well as global media Valieva has continued to train amid the uncertainty and media attention, sometimes looking tearful. The soft toys at the rink are a reminder of her tender age and the reason why this case has been even more shocking than other failed drugs tests. Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said it was important to remember the ""human side of this story... to think about a person of 15 in this situation"". ""We need to treat this situation extremely carefully."" Among those who have been watching Valieva train are her three coaches (left to right) Daniil Gleikhengauz, Sergei Dudakov and Eteri Tutberidze At times in practice Valieva has been embraced by one of her coaches Eteri Tutberidze, who is now under the spotlight as among those who could be considered part of the ""entourage"". In a brief interview with Russian state television, Tutberidze said she was certain the teenager was ""clean and innocent"". Also seen watching from the side of the rink in Beijing have been her other coaches Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, and also team doctor Filipp Shvetsky. The coaches are all from the Sambo-70 club in Moscow, which has produced a series of successful young skaters in recent years. They include Pyeongchang 2018 champion Alina Zagitova, who was 15 when she won gold and 2018 silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva, who was 18. Meanwhile, Yulia Lipnitskaya, was 15 when she won team gold at Sochi 2014. Russian skaters arrived in Beijing strongly fancied to sweep the podium in the women's event - with 17-year-olds Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova having finished behind Valieva in a Russian 1-2-3 at the European championships last month. The trio share the same coaches and all three regularly perform quadruple jumps - the most difficult in the sport and very rare in women's figure skating in general. Neither Trusova nor Shcherbakova have had any issues with their tests. The IOC says the Cas hearing will only be about the lifting of Valieva's provisional suspension, which was imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada). The full case will be heard by Rusada because the drug test was at a national competition, but Wada can appeal against any decision. Valieva returned a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine at the Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December. But it was only reported on 8 February, the day after she became the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics to help the Russian Olympic Committee team win gold. When the issue came to light, the medal ceremony was postponed at short notice. The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until after the outcome of the hearing. Trimetazidine is used in the prevention of angina attacks but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. Valieva has been allowed to train after a successful challenge against her provisional suspension by Rusada. But the IOC, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have now appealed to Cas against Rusada's decision to allow her to continue. The Cas panel will consist of president Fabio Iudica of Italy and arbitrators Jeffrey Benz, of the United States, and Slovenian Vesna Bergant Rakocevic.

"This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump 24th Winter Olympic Games Hosts:Beijing, ChinaDates:4-20 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds; live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and mobile app Scrutiny of those around Kamila Valieva has increased after the World Anti-Doping Agency said it will investigate the adults working with the teenager. The 15-year-old Russian's failed drugs test has cast a dark cloud over the Beijing Winter Olympics, with her age prompting questions over how a child became embroiled in suspected doping. The figure skater was training in Beijing on Sunday, hours before a hearing to determine her Olympic fate. She came here tipped for women's gold. The European champion, whofailed a drugs testin December, will hear on Monday if she can compete in the individual women's event in Beijing on Tuesday. A lengthy hearing concluded on Sunday and a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) panel will decide whether to suspend her. ""It was a long hearing. Now the panel will deliberate until tomorrow morning, the end of the morning,"" said Matthieu Reeb, the general secretary of Cas. ""I cannot comment on anything at the hearing but I hope to give you a decision in a few hours."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had earlier called for global anti-doping body Wada to investigate her entourage. Hours later, Wada said it would ask its independent intelligence and investigations department to look into the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her. Kamila Valieva 'entourage' investigation would be welcome - IOC Valieva test puts Russia & doping in spotlight again Kamila Valieva's training has been watched by soft toys as well as global media Valieva has continued to train amid the uncertainty and media attention, sometimes looking tearful. The soft toys at the rink are a reminder of her tender age and the reason why this case has been even more shocking than other failed drugs tests. Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said it was important to remember the ""human side of this story... to think about a person of 15 in this situation"". ""We need to treat this situation extremely carefully."" Among those who have been watching Valieva train are her three coaches (left to right) Daniil Gleikhengauz, Sergei Dudakov and Eteri Tutberidze At times in practice Valieva has been embraced by one of her coaches Eteri Tutberidze, who is now under the spotlight as among those who could be considered part of the ""entourage"". In a brief interview with Russian state television, Tutberidze said she was certain the teenager was ""clean and innocent"". Also seen watching from the side of the rink in Beijing have been her other coaches Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, and also team doctor Filipp Shvetsky. The coaches are all from the Sambo-70 club in Moscow, which has produced a series of successful young skaters in recent years. They include Pyeongchang 2018 champion Alina Zagitova, who was 15 when she won gold and 2018 silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva, who was 18. Meanwhile, Yulia Lipnitskaya, was 15 when she won team gold at Sochi 2014. Russian skaters arrived in Beijing strongly fancied to sweep the podium in the women's event - with 17-year-olds Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova having finished behind Valieva in a Russian 1-2-3 at the European championships last month. The trio share the same coaches and all three regularly perform quadruple jumps - the most difficult in the sport and very rare in women's figure skating in general. Neither Trusova nor Shcherbakova have had any issues with their tests. The IOC says the Cas hearing will only be about the lifting of Valieva's provisional suspension, which was imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada). The full case will be heard by Rusada because the drug test was at a national competition, but Wada can appeal against any decision. Valieva returned a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine at the Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December. But it was only reported on 8 February, the day after she became the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics to help the Russian Olympic Committee team win gold. When the issue came to light, the medal ceremony was postponed at short notice. The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until after the outcome of the hearing. Trimetazidine is used in the prevention of angina attacks but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. Valieva has been allowed to train after a successful challenge against her provisional suspension by Rusada. But the IOC, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have now appealed to Cas against Rusada's decision to allow her to continue. The Cas panel will consist of president Fabio Iudica of Italy and arbitrators Jeffrey Benz, of the United States, and Slovenian Vesna Bergant Rakocevic.

"Friends ended in 2004 after 10 seasons but has remained hugely popular worldwide since then Several Chinese streaming platforms have been accused of censoring LGBT plotlines from hit US sitcom Friends. The show was re-released in China earlier this week on Tencent, Bilibili, Sohu, iQiyi and Alibaba's Youku. But Chinese fans have complained of scenes being deleted, including those that reference a lesbian character, and another featuring a same-sex kiss. It is unclear why the scenes have been removed, and none of the platforms have responded publicly to the accusations. The show, which ran from 1994-2004, is based in New York City and centres around a group of friends played by Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. Friends has a massive following in China, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with teaching them English and introducing them to US culture. Sohu held broadcast rights between 2012 and 2018, and aired full, uncensored episodes at the time. China TV blurs Western brands over Xinjiang cotton Can Western brands recover in China after backlash? China changes Fight Club film ending But Chinese fans shared their dismay on social media about the re-release and its omissions. In one instance, dialogue was axed about the ex-wife of one character, Ross, who left him after she realised she was a lesbian. Incorrect subtitles were also used to downplay sexual references, the South China Morning Post reports. In one scene, the phrase ""multiple orgasms"" was translated to the Chinese phrase for ""women have endless gossips"". ""Not only does it ignore women's sexual desire and enjoyment... [it] also reinforces the gender stereotype of women,"" one user wrote on social media site Weibo, according to CNN. ""If you can't show the complete version under the current atmosphere, then don't import it,"" wrote another. Several users have called for a boycott of the show in protest. The hashtag #FriendsCensored has became a popular term on Weibo in recent days. But on Sunday, searches for the hashtag and other variations produced either zero or limited results - indicating discussions may have caught the attention of Chinese censors. Lady Gaga's appearance at a Friends reunion was cut from Chinese broadcasts last year In recent years, China has shut down tens of thousands of websites and social media accounts containing ""vulgar"" and pornographic content, and other material deemed illegal or anti-Chinese. Scenes featuring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and K-Pop band BTS were cut froma Friends reunion special aired last year. It's unclear why the musicians were removed from the final broadcast, but all three have previously been accused of insulting China. Lady Gaga, for example, has been banned from touring in the country after meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016.

"No-campaign posters have sprung up warning: ""Today tobacco, tomorrow sausages?"" Swiss voters have backed a ban on tobacco advertising anywhere young people might see it. In effect, the Yes vote in the nationwide referendum will lead to a complete ban. The move will bring Switzerland into line with its European neighbours, most of whom adopted strict rules on tobacco advertising years ago. Despite its healthy, environmentally friendly image, Switzerland has the most lax rules on tobacco in Europe. Long after smoking in pubs and restaurants was outlawed in the UK, France, or Germany, the Swiss were still puffing away. Supermarket shoppers would regularly be approached by smiling young women giving away free samples of the latest cigarette brand. And while those things were banned a few years ago, tobacco advertising remained. Hailing Sunday's result, Social Democrat member of parliament Flavia Wasserfallen paid tribute to the doctors' and teachers' associations who campaigned for the ban. ""People worked really hard for policy that puts young people at its heart,"" she told Swiss television. The World Health Organization's historic Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was negotiated in Geneva almost 20 years ago. Switzerland signed it, but still has not ratified it - the only country in Europe not to - because its legislation on advertising was not, until Sunday's vote, compliant. Yes-campaign posters say more children smoke because of tobacco advertising Compared with much of Europe, cigarettes here are cheap and 27% of Swiss adults smoke - higher than the European average. Time and again legislation aimed at introducing tighter restrictions was rejected in parliament. And even after campaigners gathered enough signatures to force the referendum demanding a ban, the Swiss government recommended a No vote. Those backing the ban say that is down to the presence of the world's major tobacco companies here. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco all have their headquarters in Switzerland. The tobacco industry is estimated to contribute over $6bn (Â£4.5bn; â¬5bn) a year, and 11,000 jobs, to the Swiss economy. Just days before the vote it became clear - as many had suspected - that the tobacco companies had been funding the No campaign. Opponents argued a ban on advertising a legal product was unacceptable, and that it would open the door to restrictions on other things, like sugar or alcohol, judged to be harmful to health. Posters featuring some of Switzerland's favourite foods - cake and sausages - appeared with the bleak warning ""these will be next"". But voters were less than impressed by the campaign. Switzerland has 9,000 tobacco-related deaths each year and the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses is a drain on the health system. It also pushes up the cost of health insurance, which everyone has to pay, whether they are a smoker or not. 'Too much smoking in French films' One million French smokers quit in a year Swiss voters reject key climate change measures Ahead of the vote, opinion polls suggested more than 60% would back the ban. In the end that was reduced to 56%, but still a clear majority. ""The people understood that health is more important than economic interests,"" Stefanie de Borba of the Swiss League against Cancer told AFP news agency. Three other decisions went before Swiss voters on Sunday as well: on banning all animal testing, on more financial subsidies for the media, and on ending stamp duty for equity capital. All three were rejected. The animal testing was viewed as too limiting for Switzerland's world class medical research and development sector. The media subsidies were viewed by many voters as lining the pockets of media barons, while abolishing stamp duty would, voters thought, simply have made people who were already rich even richer. These are complex subjects for voters to decide on, but that is how Switzerland's system of direct democracy works. There is rule of thumb about how voters should decide if they feel they do not understand the issues: take the government's advice. But on Sunday the government urged a yes to media subsidies, and lost. It urged a yes to abolishing the stamp duty and lost, and it urged a no to the ban on tobacco advertising, and lost. Ministers may have to take some time to reflect on whether they are out of touch with voters. But as for tobacco, as one Swiss commentator put it on Sunday: ""In the choice between economic freedom and health, the majority of voters chose the latter... Whether it's advertising bans, smoking bans or more expensive cigarettes, smoking no longer has a lobby among the people - unlike among the politicians.""

"A police raid has finally put an end to the costly bridge blockade at Windsor, Ontario, with the crossing reopening for traffic on Sunday night after a six-day protest. But with the demonstrations in Ottawa still going strong, is any end in sight for the anti-mandate movement? This was the moment the protesters had dreaded. ""I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" Tyler Kok told the BBC as he left the site. The officers arrived by the bus load on Sunday morning - in balaclavas and carrying long guns, ready to oust the last few protesters blocking the roads leading to the Ambassador Bridge. A week-long stalemate was about to come to an end. About 100 vehicles had been parked along a 2km (1.25 miles) stretch of the road for days on end. There were pickups, SUVs and even a dog-grooming van, festooned with Canadian flags, anti-vaccination slogans and anti-Trudeau epithets, as well as some heavy commercial trucks. The people were a mix of evangelical Christians, anti-mask mums, vaccine sceptics and local residents who are tired of lockdowns and vaccine passports. The Freedom Convoy, as it's been called, began as a protest against a mandate requiring truckers who cross the US-Canada border to be vaccinated against Covid. Police detain a protester as they clear the bridge But the group is not united by any one occupation - rather, they share a distrust of vaccines, a concern for government overreach and a general dislike of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Similar blockades have also popped up at other border crossings across the country - four people were arrested at one in British Columbia on Sunday. But the biggest one in Windsor is no more. The police began stage one of their clearance operation on Saturday and only a few dozen remained by Sunday morning after a bitterly cold night. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? How do you remove a 30-tonne truck? That meant police could make their final and decisive move. Dozens of officers descended on the two remaining encampments located about a kilometre apart on the single road leading to the bridge. They erected cement barricades and flanked them on all sides. But while in France officers had fired tear gas to keep similar protests at bay, Windsor Police said they prioritised safety over speed. A court-ordered injunction had been in place since Friday, but police waited over 36 hours, mindful that there were many children among the demonstrators. ""I think that's something that speaks to our Canadian society,"" Sergeant Steve Betteridge told the BBC. Police made about 12 arrests but the majority of protesters voluntarily left the area and drove their vehicles home. Clearly outnumbered, they honked their horns - a swan song to the blockade that had gone on far longer than anyone had anticipated. Canada has a 90% vaccination rate, far higher than the US, and in many parts of the country you need to show proof of vaccination to access bars, gyms and restaurants. This video can not be played Truckers 'don't have the right to hold us hostage' About 750km (466 miles) east of the Ambassador Bridge, the protest group that has taken over the nation's capital was showing no signs of slowing down on Sunday. But then came news of a breakthrough - an apparent deal struck by the city of Ottawa that would mean the convoy of trucks relocating away from residential areas. However protest leaders later said no deal had been agreed. Unlike the Windsor crowd, which was limited to one major road, the Ottawa protest has essentially taken over the centre of a major city, with thousands of people flooding the streets with Canadian flags. Barbecues are set up on the street with food being handed out to hungry demonstrators, while people play street hockey to the sounds of dance music, honking horns and chants of ""freedom"". ""This is not an anti-vax movement; this is a freedom movement. It's for choice,"" said Justin Smith, who was enjoying Beavertails - a Canadian pastry - with his wife Brandy Lawrence on the sidelines of the protests on Saturday evening. Both were wearing Canadian flags as capes. ""This nation is through and through my heart, I love Canada like you wouldn't believe,"" said Mr Smith. They say they hate what mandates have done to their family, including their five children aged six to 16. ""I want my kids to go into a store and see a smile on someone's face. That's the saddest thing,"" said Ms Lawrence. This wasn't the couple's first time in the Ottawa ""red zone"" - they came to support the convoy in its first weekend, and drove the five hours from their home in southern Ontario to be there a second time. ""I will do anything and everything I can do to support these people,"" says Mr Smith. A demonstrator in Ottawa cooks breakfast There is a police presence - but mostly on the margins. A court order silenced loud honking from the trucks earlier this week, granting respite to downtown residents aggravated by the noise. But some residents fed up with the noise and the disruption have accused police of idling by and allowing an occupation. Some businesses - including a major shopping centre - have closed their doors or have seen a drop in traffic. While many of the demonstrators have been peaceful, residents have told the BBC they have been shouted at for wearing masks, and had trouble getting to and from work. ""We don't terrorise people and confront people wearing masks or barge into businesses try to harass and intimidate the staff,"" says Marika Morris. ""This is not what we do to express our political views."" If the Ottawa protest has caused maximum community disturbance, then the Windsor protest caused maximum economic disruption by shutting down one of the country's major trade arteries, the Ambassador Bridge linking Windsor with Detroit, Michigan. More than $323m (Â£238m) in goods crosses that bridge every day, and for nearly a week, not a dollar has made it to the US or back. Almost half of that is from the trade of car parts, says Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association. He does not mince words when it comes to the protest. ""In Windsor we have at its core, several dozen people who are macroeconomically illiterate and absolutely disrespectful of their own community, that they would imperil the economy of the region to make a point,"" he said. ""Never has a tantrum cost so many people so much."" After the clearance operation, police remained behind. The bridge will reopen on Sunday or Monday. But Volpe said the harm to the auto-parts industry will last much longer than that, because it will take three to four days to get the supply chain fully functional. The total cost of lost production and shipments he estimates at about C$1b ($790m, Â£580m). He also said the damage to Canada's reputation with its US trading partner is devastating, especially as American politicians push for protectionist policies. In a statement, Windsor police say there will be ""zero tolerance"" for any illegal activity. But how they will stop further blockades from springing up, while still keeping the bridge open, remains to be seen. Sergeant Betteridge said he hopes the occupants feel they were heard and realise that further disruption is not required. ""The protesters came wanting to get a message across, and I think they did get a message across,"" he said. ""If anyone is thinking of breaking the law, they've seen what has happened here.""

"Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay has said his appointment to chief of staff is ""an honour"" Government will take a ""step back"" from people's lives and pursue ""a smaller state"", the PM's new top aide has said. Steve Barclaytold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat while public health interventions and vast amounts spent in the pandemic were the right decisions, it was time for ""a more enabling approach"". The PMmade cabinet minister Mr Barclayhis new chief of staff last week. No 10 says the prime minister will focus on domestic policy on a tour of parts of the UK this week. It comes as Boris Johnson faces continued criticism and concern from some Conservative MPs about his leadership. Boris Johnson names two key aides What do key resignations mean for PM? Mr Barclay's appointment as chief of staff was part of a No 10 shake-up in the wake of civil servant Sue Gray's initial report into Downing Street lockdown parties, and the ongoing police investigation into gatherings.

"A police raid has finally put an end to the costly bridge blockade at Windsor, Ontario, with the crossing reopening for traffic on Sunday night after a six-day protest. But with the demonstrations in Ottawa still going strong, is any end in sight for the anti-mandate movement? This was the moment the protesters had dreaded. ""I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" Tyler Kok told the BBC as he left the site. The officers arrived by the bus load on Sunday morning - in balaclavas and carrying long guns, ready to oust the last few protesters blocking the roads leading to the Ambassador Bridge. A week-long stalemate was about to come to an end. About 100 vehicles had been parked along a 2km (1.25 miles) stretch of the road for days on end. There were pickups, SUVs and even a dog-grooming van, festooned with Canadian flags, anti-vaccination slogans and anti-Trudeau epithets, as well as some heavy commercial trucks. The people were a mix of evangelical Christians, anti-mask mums, vaccine sceptics and local residents who are tired of lockdowns and vaccine passports. The Freedom Convoy, as it's been called, began as a protest against a mandate requiring truckers who cross the US-Canada border to be vaccinated against Covid. Police detain a protester as they clear the bridge But the group is not united by any one occupation - rather, they share a distrust of vaccines, a concern for government overreach and a general dislike of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Similar blockades have also popped up at other border crossings across the country - four people were arrested at one in British Columbia on Sunday. But the biggest one in Windsor is no more. The police began stage one of their clearance operation on Saturday and only a few dozen remained by Sunday morning after a bitterly cold night. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? How do you remove a 30-tonne truck? That meant police could make their final and decisive move. Dozens of officers descended on the two remaining encampments located about a kilometre apart on the single road leading to the bridge. They erected cement barricades and flanked them on all sides. But while in France officers had fired tear gas to keep similar protests at bay, Windsor Police said they prioritised safety over speed. A court-ordered injunction had been in place since Friday, but police waited over 36 hours, mindful that there were many children among the demonstrators. ""I think that's something that speaks to our Canadian society,"" Sergeant Steve Betteridge told the BBC. Police made about 12 arrests but the majority of protesters voluntarily left the area and drove their vehicles home. Clearly outnumbered, they honked their horns - a swan song to the blockade that had gone on far longer than anyone had anticipated. Canada has a 90% vaccination rate, far higher than the US, and in many parts of the country you need to show proof of vaccination to access bars, gyms and restaurants. This video can not be played Truckers 'don't have the right to hold us hostage' About 750km (466 miles) east of the Ambassador Bridge, the protest group that has taken over the nation's capital was showing no signs of slowing down on Sunday. But then came news of a breakthrough - an apparent deal struck by the city of Ottawa that would mean the convoy of trucks relocating away from residential areas. However protest leaders later said no deal had been agreed. Unlike the Windsor crowd, which was limited to one major road, the Ottawa protest has essentially taken over the centre of a major city, with thousands of people flooding the streets with Canadian flags. Barbecues are set up on the street with food being handed out to hungry demonstrators, while people play street hockey to the sounds of dance music, honking horns and chants of ""freedom"". ""This is not an anti-vax movement; this is a freedom movement. It's for choice,"" said Justin Smith, who was enjoying Beavertails - a Canadian pastry - with his wife Brandy Lawrence on the sidelines of the protests on Saturday evening. Both were wearing Canadian flags as capes. ""This nation is through and through my heart, I love Canada like you wouldn't believe,"" said Mr Smith. They say they hate what mandates have done to their family, including their five children aged six to 16. ""I want my kids to go into a store and see a smile on someone's face. That's the saddest thing,"" said Ms Lawrence. This wasn't the couple's first time in the Ottawa ""red zone"" - they came to support the convoy in its first weekend, and drove the five hours from their home in southern Ontario to be there a second time. ""I will do anything and everything I can do to support these people,"" says Mr Smith. A demonstrator in Ottawa cooks breakfast There is a police presence - but mostly on the margins. A court order silenced loud honking from the trucks earlier this week, granting respite to downtown residents aggravated by the noise. But some residents fed up with the noise and the disruption have accused police of idling by and allowing an occupation. Some businesses - including a major shopping centre - have closed their doors or have seen a drop in traffic. While many of the demonstrators have been peaceful, residents have told the BBC they have been shouted at for wearing masks, and had trouble getting to and from work. ""We don't terrorise people and confront people wearing masks or barge into businesses try to harass and intimidate the staff,"" says Marika Morris. ""This is not what we do to express our political views."" If the Ottawa protest has caused maximum community disturbance, then the Windsor protest caused maximum economic disruption by shutting down one of the country's major trade arteries, the Ambassador Bridge linking Windsor with Detroit, Michigan. More than $323m (Â£238m) in goods crosses that bridge every day, and for nearly a week, not a dollar has made it to the US or back. Almost half of that is from the trade of car parts, says Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association. He does not mince words when it comes to the protest. ""In Windsor we have at its core, several dozen people who are macroeconomically illiterate and absolutely disrespectful of their own community, that they would imperil the economy of the region to make a point,"" he said. ""Never has a tantrum cost so many people so much."" After the clearance operation, police remained behind. The bridge will reopen on Sunday or Monday. But Volpe said the harm to the auto-parts industry will last much longer than that, because it will take three to four days to get the supply chain fully functional. The total cost of lost production and shipments he estimates at about C$1b ($790m, Â£580m). He also said the damage to Canada's reputation with its US trading partner is devastating, especially as American politicians push for protectionist policies. In a statement, Windsor police say there will be ""zero tolerance"" for any illegal activity. But how they will stop further blockades from springing up, while still keeping the bridge open, remains to be seen. Sergeant Betteridge said he hopes the occupants feel they were heard and realise that further disruption is not required. ""The protesters came wanting to get a message across, and I think they did get a message across,"" he said. ""If anyone is thinking of breaking the law, they've seen what has happened here.""

The 15-year-old Russian's failed drugs test has cast a dark cloud over the Beijing Winter Olympics, with her age prompting questions over how a child became embroiled in suspected doping. The figure skater was training in Beijing on Sunday, hours before a hearing to determine her Olympic fate. She came here tipped for women's gold. The European champion, whofailed a drugs testin December, will hear on Monday if she can compete in the individual women's event in Beijing on Tuesday. A lengthy hearing concluded on Sunday and a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) panel will decide whether to suspend her. ""It was a long hearing. Now the panel will deliberate until tomorrow morning, the end of the morning,"" said Matthieu Reeb, the general secretary of Cas. ""I cannot comment on anything at the hearing but I hope to give you a decision in a few hours."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had earlier called for global anti-doping body Wada to investigate her entourage. Hours later, Wada said it would ask its independent intelligence and investigations department to look into the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her. Kamila Valieva 'entourage' investigation would be welcome - IOC Valieva test puts Russia & doping in spotlight again Kamila Valieva's training has been watched by soft toys as well as global media Valieva has continued to train amid the uncertainty and media attention, sometimes looking tearful. The soft toys at the rink are a reminder of her tender age and the reason why this case has been even more shocking than other failed drugs tests. Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said it was important to remember the ""human side of this story... to think about a person of 15 in this situation"". ""We need to treat this situation extremely carefully."" Among those who have been watching Valieva train are her three coaches (left to right) Daniil Gleikhengauz, Sergei Dudakov and Eteri Tutberidze At times in practice Valieva has been embraced by one of her coaches Eteri Tutberidze, who is now under the spotlight as among those who could be considered part of the ""entourage"". In a brief interview with Russian state television, Tutberidze said she was certain the teenager was ""clean and innocent"". Also seen watching from the side of the rink in Beijing have been her other coaches Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, and also team doctor Filipp Shvetsky. The coaches are all from the Sambo-70 club in Moscow, which has produced a series of successful young skaters in recent years. They include Pyeongchang 2018 champion Alina Zagitova, who was 15 when she won gold and 2018 silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva, who was 18. Meanwhile, Yulia Lipnitskaya, was 15 when she won team gold at Sochi 2014. Russian skaters arrived in Beijing strongly fancied to sweep the podium in the women's event - with 17-year-olds Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova having finished behind Valieva in a Russian 1-2-3 at the European championships last month. The trio share the same coaches and all three regularly perform quadruple jumps - the most difficult in the sport and very rare in women's figure skating in general. Neither Trusova nor Shcherbakova have had any issues with their tests. The IOC says the Cas hearing will only be about the lifting of Valieva's provisional suspension, which was imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada). The full case will be heard by Rusada because the drug test was at a national competition, but Wada can appeal against any decision. Valieva returned a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine at the Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December. But it was only reported on 8 February, the day after she became the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics to help the Russian Olympic Committee team win gold. When the issue came to light, the medal ceremony was postponed at short notice. The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until after the outcome of the hearing. Trimetazidine is used in the prevention of angina attacks but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. Valieva has been allowed to train after a successful challenge against her provisional suspension by Rusada. But the IOC, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have now appealed to Cas against Rusada's decision to allow her to continue. The Cas panel will consist of president Fabio Iudica of Italy and arbitrators Jeffrey Benz, of the United States, and Slovenian Vesna Bergant Rakocevic.

"Clare Sinton is calling for midwives and health visitors to be trained to diagnose tongue-tie Tongue-tie is a condition which affects about 10% of newborn babies in the UK, but parents say they can face major struggles for services and support. It occurs when the strip of skin connecting the tongue and the floor of the mouth is shorter than usual, and can affect feeding, although not always. Two mums have told the BBC of their problems trying to feed their newborn babies with the condition. ""Excruciating, unbearable, helpless."" This is how mother-of-two Clare Sinton described her experience breastfeeding her tongue-tied baby. Some babies with the condition struggle to latch on to the breast, but awareness of it as an infant feeding issue can be poor, and tongue-tie can be hard to spot. A simple procedure available on the NHS resolves feeding issues almost immediately, but some parents seek private treatment costing up to Â£400 to avoid waiting, or abandon breastfeeding altogether. Clare has questioned why mums are ""having to fight when you're at your lowest ebb, and be listened to when you know something isn't right?"". She said: ""It's amazing that in this day and age you still have to fight for an assessment or diagnosis, and then still pay for an urgent procedure, despite it tearing you to shreds and risking your ability to breastfeed."" Clare said there was ""no way"" she could have continued to breastfeed if Lily's tongue-tie had not been treated When she had her daughter Lily in October, she knew something was not right with her feeding immediately. ""It was excruciatingly painful,"" Clare, from Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol, said. ""It felt like someone was dragging barbed wire or blades through my nipples. ""I breastfed my son for 19 months so I knew what it should feel like, and it felt wrong from the get-go."" Clare suspected Lilymight have a posterior tongue-tie,,externalbut a midwife at Southmead Hospital was unable to confirm if she was correct. Clare, a physiotherapist and nutritionist, left hospital and persevered. When Lily was born Clare said she knew something was not right with her feeding straight away Recalling the first few days at home, she said: ""I was crying with every feed. It felt like she (Lily) had a beak, like a turtle clamping down on me. ""I was beside myself. I was in pain constantly 24/7. I was dreading every feed and Lily was feeling the tension in my body."" By this point, Clare was black and blue from Lily's attempts to breastfeed. She started researching private treatment, and found a specialist in Cardiff. After a short assessment it was confirmed Lily had a posterior tongue-tie and not long afterwards, it was snipped. Clare said feeding her felt better ""immediately"" and a few weeks later they were breastfeeding successfully. The 40-year-old said: ""It was really quite emotional. I just sobbed because I was so relieved. It was like a weight had come off my shoulders, it was incredible. ""Those five days [when Lily first came home] were absolute hell. It left me feeling very helpless and thinking this is so unfair that women should have to go through what I've been through."" Tongue-tie is where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the bottom of their mouth is shorter than usual Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is diagnosed when babies have an unusually short or tight frenulum (fold of tissue) under their tongues. About half of babies affectedwill require treatment,external(frenulotomy) because of the difficulties caused to feeding. Mothers may stop breastfeeding earlier than planned because of their baby's difficulties and experience reduced milk supply because of ineffective milk removal. They may experience pain and/or nipple damage and develop mastitis, blocked ducts or breast abscesses. Source:Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners,external Katharine Sharlott, from Southampton, had a similar experience with her baby Quinn, having been told by a midwife that his tongue movement looked fine. She persevered through six weeks of difficult feeding before getting help from a breastfeeding counsellor at the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and being referred to a tongue-tie service. Katharine explained: ""My baby had a 75% tie and it was cut. This improved feeding initially, but actually we still encountered problems. ""I went back to the breastfeeding counsellor and, having ruled out other issues, agreed there could still be a problem with tongue-tie. As my baby was older by then, there would have been a longer wait to be seen on the NHS."" Like Clare, she sought private treatment, which determined that either some of the tie had been missed or it had reattached, so it was divided again. ""This finally solved things, but my baby was almost three months old by then,"" Katherine added. ""If I had not had the previous experience of breastfeeding my eldest, the support of the NCT breastfeeding counsellor and the financial means to pay for a private midwife, I don't believe I would have continued breastfeeding."" Both women are calling for midwives and health visitors to be better trained to diagnose tongue-tie. Clare added: ""There should be someone on hand to assess it from the get-go. It shouldn't be a wait and see, because no mother should have to go through what I went through - it's inhumane."" Dr Paul Mannix, clinical director at North Bristol NHS Trust for women and children's health, said: ""It's so important mothers get early support with breastfeeding, which is why all our midwives are trained to help with this, including how to look for tongue-tie. ""Having spoken to Ms Sinton, we are sorry that her experience did not reflect this and will ensure that all staff are clear about the support available for mums who raise concerns about tongue-tie."" The National Childbirth Trust is calling for a consistent NHS service to be offered across the country The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said training on support for women whose babies are having problems latching on to the breast, which may be because of tongue-tie, is included in training for midwives. Additional training is provided which includes recognising tongue-tie, its treatments and support. Michelle Lyne, RCM education adviser, said: ""There is clearly a need for more research around tongue-tie, so that a definitive definition of what it is and when it is present can be agreed, so that evidence-based guidelines for support and treatment can be developed. ""Often babies with tongue-tie will have no symptoms, and it may resolve spontaneously over time. It's also common that problems don't become apparent until midwifery contact has stopped, usually about 10 to 14 days after the birth. ""When it is identified, the focus is on breastfeeding support for the mother."" She added evidence for further treatment, such as cutting a tight frenulum, was slim and generally a last course of action, as sometimes even significant cases do not affect feeding - so mothers and their babies must be looked at individually. Photographing breastfeeding woman to be outlawed 'You just want to feed your child' The NCT has called for more research into the best care for babies with suspected tongue-tie and a consistent NHS service across the country. Joanna Daniels, NCT breastfeeding and infant feeding engagement lead, said: ""There is no common agreement among tongue-tie dividers on how to carry out the procedure or how far the membrane should be divided. This means the service that different health professionals offer varies."" Vicky Jordan, from the Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners, said: ""Awareness of tongue-tie restriction by health professionals is not universal, and this sometimes leads to tongue-tie restriction being missed and/or parents being told that their baby doesn't have a tongue-tie restriction. ""Infant feeding and frenulotomy services are variable across the country, leading to inequalities to access of appropriate treatment.""

She said: ""It's amazing that in this day and age you still have to fight for an assessment or diagnosis, and then still pay for an urgent procedure, despite it tearing you to shreds and risking your ability to breastfeed."" Clare said there was ""no way"" she could have continued to breastfeed if Lily's tongue-tie had not been treated When she had her daughter Lily in October, she knew something was not right with her feeding immediately. ""It was excruciatingly painful,"" Clare, from Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol, said. ""It felt like someone was dragging barbed wire or blades through my nipples. ""I breastfed my son for 19 months so I knew what it should feel like, and it felt wrong from the get-go."" Clare suspected Lilymight have a posterior tongue-tie,,externalbut a midwife at Southmead Hospital was unable to confirm if she was correct. Clare, a physiotherapist and nutritionist, left hospital and persevered. When Lily was born Clare said she knew something was not right with her feeding straight away Recalling the first few days at home, she said: ""I was crying with every feed. It felt like she (Lily) had a beak, like a turtle clamping down on me. ""I was beside myself. I was in pain constantly 24/7. I was dreading every feed and Lily was feeling the tension in my body."" By this point, Clare was black and blue from Lily's attempts to breastfeed. She started researching private treatment, and found a specialist in Cardiff. After a short assessment it was confirmed Lily had a posterior tongue-tie and not long afterwards, it was snipped. Clare said feeding her felt better ""immediately"" and a few weeks later they were breastfeeding successfully. The 40-year-old said: ""It was really quite emotional. I just sobbed because I was so relieved. It was like a weight had come off my shoulders, it was incredible. ""Those five days [when Lily first came home] were absolute hell. It left me feeling very helpless and thinking this is so unfair that women should have to go through what I've been through."" Tongue-tie is where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the bottom of their mouth is shorter than usual Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is diagnosed when babies have an unusually short or tight frenulum (fold of tissue) under their tongues. About half of babies affectedwill require treatment,external(frenulotomy) because of the difficulties caused to feeding. Mothers may stop breastfeeding earlier than planned because of their baby's difficulties and experience reduced milk supply because of ineffective milk removal. They may experience pain and/or nipple damage and develop mastitis, blocked ducts or breast abscesses. Source:Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners,external Katharine Sharlott, from Southampton, had a similar experience with her baby Quinn, having been told by a midwife that his tongue movement looked fine. She persevered through six weeks of difficult feeding before getting help from a breastfeeding counsellor at the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and being referred to a tongue-tie service. Katharine explained: ""My baby had a 75% tie and it was cut. This improved feeding initially, but actually we still encountered problems. ""I went back to the breastfeeding counsellor and, having ruled out other issues, agreed there could still be a problem with tongue-tie. As my baby was older by then, there would have been a longer wait to be seen on the NHS."" Like Clare, she sought private treatment, which determined that either some of the tie had been missed or it had reattached, so it was divided again. ""This finally solved things, but my baby was almost three months old by then,"" Katherine added. ""If I had not had the previous experience of breastfeeding my eldest, the support of the NCT breastfeeding counsellor and the financial means to pay for a private midwife, I don't believe I would have continued breastfeeding."" Both women are calling for midwives and health visitors to be better trained to diagnose tongue-tie. Clare added: ""There should be someone on hand to assess it from the get-go. It shouldn't be a wait and see, because no mother should have to go through what I went through - it's inhumane."" Dr Paul Mannix, clinical director at North Bristol NHS Trust for women and children's health, said: ""It's so important mothers get early support with breastfeeding, which is why all our midwives are trained to help with this, including how to look for tongue-tie. ""Having spoken to Ms Sinton, we are sorry that her experience did not reflect this and will ensure that all staff are clear about the support available for mums who raise concerns about tongue-tie."" The National Childbirth Trust is calling for a consistent NHS service to be offered across the country The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said training on support for women whose babies are having problems latching on to the breast, which may be because of tongue-tie, is included in training for midwives. Additional training is provided which includes recognising tongue-tie, its treatments and support. Michelle Lyne, RCM education adviser, said: ""There is clearly a need for more research around tongue-tie, so that a definitive definition of what it is and when it is present can be agreed, so that evidence-based guidelines for support and treatment can be developed. ""Often babies with tongue-tie will have no symptoms, and it may resolve spontaneously over time. It's also common that problems don't become apparent until midwifery contact has stopped, usually about 10 to 14 days after the birth. ""When it is identified, the focus is on breastfeeding support for the mother."" She added evidence for further treatment, such as cutting a tight frenulum, was slim and generally a last course of action, as sometimes even significant cases do not affect feeding - so mothers and their babies must be looked at individually. Photographing breastfeeding woman to be outlawed 'You just want to feed your child' The NCT has called for more research into the best care for babies with suspected tongue-tie and a consistent NHS service across the country. Joanna Daniels, NCT breastfeeding and infant feeding engagement lead, said: ""There is no common agreement among tongue-tie dividers on how to carry out the procedure or how far the membrane should be divided. This means the service that different health professionals offer varies."" Vicky Jordan, from the Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners, said: ""Awareness of tongue-tie restriction by health professionals is not universal, and this sometimes leads to tongue-tie restriction being missed and/or parents being told that their baby doesn't have a tongue-tie restriction. ""Infant feeding and frenulotomy services are variable across the country, leading to inequalities to access of appropriate treatment.""

"This video can not be played Kamila Valieva lands historic quadruple jump 24th Winter Olympic Games Hosts:Beijing, ChinaDates:4-20 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds; live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and mobile app Scrutiny of those around Kamila Valieva has increased after the World Anti-Doping Agency said it will investigate the adults working with the teenager. The 15-year-old Russian's failed drugs test has cast a dark cloud over the Beijing Winter Olympics, with her age prompting questions over how a child became embroiled in suspected doping. The figure skater was training in Beijing on Sunday, hours before a hearing to determine her Olympic fate. She came here tipped for women's gold. The European champion, whofailed a drugs testin December, will hear on Monday if she can compete in the individual women's event in Beijing on Tuesday. A lengthy hearing concluded on Sunday and a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) panel will decide whether to suspend her. ""It was a long hearing. Now the panel will deliberate until tomorrow morning, the end of the morning,"" said Matthieu Reeb, the general secretary of Cas. ""I cannot comment on anything at the hearing but I hope to give you a decision in a few hours."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had earlier called for global anti-doping body Wada to investigate her entourage. Hours later, Wada said it would ask its independent intelligence and investigations department to look into the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her. Kamila Valieva 'entourage' investigation would be welcome - IOC Valieva test puts Russia & doping in spotlight again Kamila Valieva's training has been watched by soft toys as well as global media Valieva has continued to train amid the uncertainty and media attention, sometimes looking tearful. The soft toys at the rink are a reminder of her tender age and the reason why this case has been even more shocking than other failed drugs tests. Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said it was important to remember the ""human side of this story... to think about a person of 15 in this situation"". ""We need to treat this situation extremely carefully."" Among those who have been watching Valieva train are her three coaches (left to right) Daniil Gleikhengauz, Sergei Dudakov and Eteri Tutberidze At times in practice Valieva has been embraced by one of her coaches Eteri Tutberidze, who is now under the spotlight as among those who could be considered part of the ""entourage"". In a brief interview with Russian state television, Tutberidze said she was certain the teenager was ""clean and innocent"". Also seen watching from the side of the rink in Beijing have been her other coaches Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, and also team doctor Filipp Shvetsky. The coaches are all from the Sambo-70 club in Moscow, which has produced a series of successful young skaters in recent years. They include Pyeongchang 2018 champion Alina Zagitova, who was 15 when she won gold and 2018 silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva, who was 18. Meanwhile, Yulia Lipnitskaya, was 15 when she won team gold at Sochi 2014. Russian skaters arrived in Beijing strongly fancied to sweep the podium in the women's event - with 17-year-olds Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova having finished behind Valieva in a Russian 1-2-3 at the European championships last month. The trio share the same coaches and all three regularly perform quadruple jumps - the most difficult in the sport and very rare in women's figure skating in general. Neither Trusova nor Shcherbakova have had any issues with their tests. The IOC says the Cas hearing will only be about the lifting of Valieva's provisional suspension, which was imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada). The full case will be heard by Rusada because the drug test was at a national competition, but Wada can appeal against any decision. Valieva returned a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine at the Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December. But it was only reported on 8 February, the day after she became the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics to help the Russian Olympic Committee team win gold. When the issue came to light, the medal ceremony was postponed at short notice. The medals for the team event - in which the United States finished second, Japan third and Canada fourth - will not be awarded until after the outcome of the hearing. Trimetazidine is used in the prevention of angina attacks but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency. Valieva has been allowed to train after a successful challenge against her provisional suspension by Rusada. But the IOC, Wada and the International Skating Union (ISU) have now appealed to Cas against Rusada's decision to allow her to continue. The Cas panel will consist of president Fabio Iudica of Italy and arbitrators Jeffrey Benz, of the United States, and Slovenian Vesna Bergant Rakocevic.

"This video can not be played James Heappey says Britons in Ukraine should leave immediately The UK will not be able to fly British nationals out of Ukraine if Russia invades, Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has warned. He told the BBC the RAF would ""not be in a position to go in"" and people there should ""leave now"". Mr Heappey said the advice had changed because Russia was in a position where it could attack ""at no notice"". Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office warnedBritish nationals in Ukraine to leave the country within 48 hourswhile commercial means were still available.A number of other countries have issued similar advice. The US also saidRussia could invade ""any day now""and told its own citizens to leave - although it said the US did not know whether President Vladimir Putin had made a final decision. Both French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden spoke with Mr Putin on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she spoke to her US counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and shared her ""acute concerns"" of military aggression against Ukraine within days. She tweeted: ""We agree Russia will face massive consequences for any invasion, including severe sanctions. Russia must deescalate and engage with Nato proposals."" Moscow has accused Western countries of stirring up hysteria. 'We don't have the option to leave Ukraine' Five ways out of Ukraine conflict Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? Following a call with world leaders on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he feared for the security of Europe and urged allies to have a ""heavy package of economic sanctions ready to go"" should Russia attack, Downing Street confirmed. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Heappey said: ""We are now confident that the artillery systems, the missile systems and the combat air are all in place that would allow Russia to launch - at no notice - an attack on Ukraine."" But he warned there would be ""a big difference between what [people] may have seen on their TV screens in Afghanistan over the summer and what may happen over the next week or so"" - referring to the international airlift to rescue people after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban last year. ""The Royal Air Force will not be in a position to go in and to fly people out so they need to leave now by commercial means or drive out of Ukraine into a neighbouring country,"" he said. British troops helping with training in Ukraine will also be leaving the country over the weekend, Mr Heappey added on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""There will be no troops in Ukraine if there's going to be a conflict there."" Some embassy staff are also being withdrawn but British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons,said on Twitter:,external""I am staying in Kyiv and continue to work there with a core team. The embassy remains operational."" The BBC's Paul Adams in Kyiv said there were signs of urgency and departure at the British embassy, with staff loading bags into a car and driving off. Nobody seemed keen to talk. The capital does not feel like a city in crisis though, our correspondent added. This video can not be played Expat Stuart McKenzie: ""If the British embassy aren't here to help, everybody's on their own"" The advice to leave Ukraine has left some Britons grappling with difficult dilemmas. Stuart McKenzie is considering heading to Poland, after spending nearly three decades in Ukraine. ""We love Ukraine and we've built our lives, families, businesses here. None of us want to leave,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""These things can get out of control very fast and we've got to be on the right side of the chaos."" But Ken Stewart said he can't leave the country - his wife has just given birth to a son, who cannot get the paperwork to travel out of Ukraine yet. He said the UK government had made clear ""we are on our own"". ""We're both pretty nervous,"" he said. Harry Lee, from Cambridge, said he is not intending to leave Kharkiv yet, where he works as a teacher, despite being just 40 miles from the Russian border. ""Life is continuing largely as normal. There's been no signs of any panic,"" he says. Read more on Britons in Ukraine Former British ambassador to the US Lord Kim Darroch said embassy and Foreign Office staff would be working around the clock to make sure British people in Ukraine - thought to number in the low thousands - were aware of the advice to leave. ""It will overwhelm the embassy's resources, you can't assume all the Brits in the country will hear this so you have to contact them,"" he told the Today programme. ""You may have to arrange an emergency telephone line, you'll need to send people to the airport where, with lots of foreign nationals trying to get out, there will be chaos. There may need to be extra flights laid on so this will occupy everyone's time for 24 hours a day for the next few days and you won't get everyone out - some people will choose to stay."" On Friday, Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP and chair of the defence select committee, raised concerns about the rhetoric being used by Washington. He told BBC's Newsnight: ""It's almost bordering on panic and that absolutely fits into Putin's objective. He'll be delighted to see the West and the Nato alliance crumbling in this way."" Nato's 30 members - which include the UK, US and several former Soviet republics - agree to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack. Ukraine is not a member of Nato. However, it is a ""partner country"" and may be allowed to join the military alliance sometime in the future, a move Russia sees as a direct threat to its security. Liz Truss had a frosty meeting with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov earlier this week The UK has made continued diplomatic efforts this week, with the prime minister visiting allies in Belgium and Poland, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss meeting her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Ms Truss's meeting proved to be ill-tempered, with Mr Lavrov saying relations between the UK and Russia left ""much to be desired"". On Friday,Defence Secretary Ben Wallace met his Russian counterpart Sergei Shogiu,who he said had given him security assurances. Mr Heappey reiterated that diplomatic lines were still being pursued. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Clearly the only route to a peaceful outcome is if talks continue, and I think if talks continue there has to be a willingness to believe what each side says to each other.""

"Protesters tried to argue with police Police have started to clear a blockade of the main crossing between Canada and the United States. After days of protests by truckers against Covid rules at the Ambassador Bridge in Ontario, officers urged them to heed an injunction against the demonstration. The vital trade route links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan. Truckers' protests against Covid vaccine mandates are also ongoing at other border crossings and in Ottawa. The self-styled ""Freedom Convoy"" movement was started by Canadian truckers opposed to a vaccinate-or-quarantine order for drivers crossing the border. Friday's court order against the blockadewas filed by the city of Windsorand the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, which argued that it was losing as much as $50m ($39m; Â£29m) per day because of the convoy. Following the injunction, Windsor Police put out a statement to ""make demonstrators clearly aware that it is a criminal offence"" to block the border crossing. The police added that a criminal conviction could lead to the seizure of vehicles and the inability to enter the US. But hours later, crowds of people waving Canadian flags flouted the order and continued to occupy the bridge. While police had some initial success in clearing the road on Saturday, more supporters arrived as the day went on until they once again outnumbered the officers trying to move the crowds away. ""We urge all demonstrators to act lawfully [and] peacefully,"" police said in a statement. ""Commuters are still being asked to avoid the areas affected by the demonstrations at this time."" Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Hundreds of other protesters continue to demonstrate in the centre of Ottawa, the nation's capital. Two other border crossings with the US are also being blocked by anti vaccine mandate protesters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades on Friday. The week-long disruption to the bridge, which accounts for roughly 25% of US-Canada goods trade, rocked the car manufacturing industry. General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda plants have been forced to halt production and cancel work shifts due to parts shortages caused by the blockade. Analysis by Robin Levinson-King in Windsor, Ontario In the cold light of Saturday morning, police came in to break up the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge. Arriving in city buses, they created a flank along the north side of the protest, which had blocked several lanes of traffic, preventing people - and millions of dollars of trade - from reaching the US, which is just on the other side of the border. Wearing balaclavas to protect them from the bitter wind, with some carrying heavy weapons, the officers made it known that the party-protest, which had been going for almost a week, had come to an end. The protesters were not happy, but neither were they surprised that it was coming to an end. Some thanked the police and expressed their support for law enforcement, while one man cried ""You should be ashamed!"" ""They're gonna have to move us out. We'll be peaceful and we'll lock arms and show unity,"" said Dan, a protester who declined to give his last name to the BBC. ""If that's what they need to do, give me a ticket and I'll see you in court."" Slowly, and with the help of an armoured vehicle, police have been inching forward, encroaching on the blockade. Some have voluntarily driven away. Others began to break down the mess-hall tents. It will likely take a few hours to move the hundred or so vehicles - most of them pickups and SUVs, with a handful of heavy commercial lorries - to disperse. Speaking on Friday, Mr Trudeau urged the truckers ""to go home now"", saying their frustration with Covid measures had been ""heard"". ""If you join the protests because you are tired of Covid, you need to understand that you are breaking laws. The consequences are becoming more and more severe,"" he warned. ""You don't want to end up losing your licence, end up with a criminal record, which will impact your job, your livelihood, even your ability to travel internationally, including to the US."" He is due to meet with his advisors on an emergency committee known as the Incident Response Group on Saturday. But many of those protesting at the bridge said they would continue to demonstrate no matter the consequences. ""Bring it,"" one of those blocking the bridge, Chris Mayville,told Canadian broadcaster CBC News,external. ""Do you think I care? Do you think I care about a fine? I'm going to pay a fine? No. You think I care about their mandates? No. This needs to end."" Elsewhere, in Canada's financial capital Toronto, police braced for protests by expanding a cordon in the city centre. There were also tense scenes in France, where thousands ofpolice officers attempted to stopanti-restriction demonstrators from disrupting traffic in Paris.
