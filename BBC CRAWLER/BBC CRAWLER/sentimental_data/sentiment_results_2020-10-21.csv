"This video can not be played More than a dozen people have been evacuated from nearby properties Two people have been killed in a suspected gas explosion at a shop in west London, firefighters have said. The blast happened in a hair salon and mobile phone shop on King Street, Southall, just after 06:30 BST. Four adults and a child are known to have been rescued by the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Earlier, the Metropolitan Police said one man was found injured. The blast is not being treated as suspicious, the force said. The explosion has damaged the Dr Phone shop and the Chandla Hair Salon on King Street Station Commander Paul Morgan said: ""Our crews continue to search the property using specialist equipment including the use of urban search-and-rescue dogs. ""We can confirm that sadly two people have died at the scene. ""The explosion caused substantial damage to the shop and structural damage throughout. ""It is a painstaking and protracted incident with firefighters working systematically to stabilise the building and search for people involved."" London Fire Brigade sent about 40 firefighters to the scene LFB said search and rescue operations have finished for the evening and will restart in the morning. Jatinder Sing, the owner of Dr Phone, said he was in ""total shock"" when he received a call about the blast. The 36-year-old said: ""They have closed off everything. It seems like an explosion of a gas cylinder and there is a flat upstairs and my shop is downstairs. ""I was shocked because my shop looks totally dead, finished and the same with the barber. ""I can't see anything from where I am standing apart from the the shutter and the main door, which is all trashed. ""I have lost my everything. We were struggling from the coronavirus period as well - too much stock in the shop and no sales for a long time so I don't know how we will survive."" Rescuers are involved in a ""complex"" search for anyone who might still be inside the collapsed building Resident Nurmila Hamid who lives nearby said she felt the blast as she was getting her children ready for school. The 38-year-old said: ""The house shook, and I turned to my husband and said 'what is that?' ""And he said, 'It's a blast' and he went to look after taking the children to school - he said it was at a phone shop."" Mohammad Rafiq, 78, who lives two streets away, said he and his 76-year-old wife felt ""shocked"" and ""scared"" when the noise from the King Street blast woke them at their home. He said: ""I heard it in the morning - it woke me up, it was scary. It sounded like a very dangerous blast so I was scared. ""We didn't sleep after that."" BBC London's Guy Lynn Sixteen people are known to have been evacuated from nearby properties I have counted 25 firefighters here sifting through the wreckage on King Street with the police this morning. The explosion has also shut off a number of streets, with the police on the scene to prevent people approaching the scene. It is a clear scene of devastation of several shops and flats, which the London Fire Brigade have called a ""structural collapse"". Sadly, it looks as though the explosion may have claimed a few lives. A further 14 adults and two children evacuated themselves from nearby properties after the blast. LFB was called at 06:38 and sent about 40 firefighters to the scene. It advised people to avoid the King Street area while the search continues. A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said paramedics had treated and discharged one person. Ealing Council said it had switched off the electricity and gas supply to some homes and businesses in the area and warned more properties might need to be evacuated.

"The restrictions rollover will continue into the start of November Bars and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are to remain closed for another week after short-term Covid-19 restrictions were extended. The move comes as a further 28 deaths linked to the virus were recorded. Scotland is due to move to a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The temporary restrictions targeting hospitality venues in the central belt in particular will continue until then to enable a ""smooth transition"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would ""not be safe"" to ease any restrictions in the short term, but said ""we believe they may already be making a difference"" to the spread of the virus. Business and hospitality leaders said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with the extension, which they described as a ""hammer blow to pubs and breweries across the country"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Bars and restaurants in Scotland's central belt - an area containing about 3.4m people - were closed on 9 October as part of what Ms Sturgeon called a ""short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". Hospitality venues in other parts of the country can only serve alcohol outdoors. These measures were originally meant to expire on 26 October, but Ms Sturgeon said they would now continue until a new ""strategic framework"" comes into force. This multi-tier system will involve different levels of restrictions that can be applied nationally or regionally depending on the level of infection. It is due to be published on Friday, and debated by MSPs after Holyrood's half term recess. Ms Sturgeon said she had agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday that the short-term restrictions should remain in place in the interim to ensure a ""smooth transition to the new system"". Ms Sturgeon said the rise in infections was ""clearly concerning"" but insisted restrictions were having an effect Business groups hit out at the move, with Liz Cameron of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce saying the hospitality sector in particular would be ""absolutely devastated that restrictions now look to be in place indefinitely"". Joe Crawford from the Campaign for Real Ale group said the move was a ""hammer blow"" to pubs and breweries ""who feel like they're being offered up as a sacrificial lamb without sufficient evidence"". And Andrew McRae from the Federation of Small Businesses said the current measures had a ""disproportionate"" impact on smaller firms, adding: ""This new strategy must have meaningful input from the business community."" Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""first and foremost a public health decision"", having earlier set out rising numbers of cases, people being treated in hospitals, and deaths. The latest figures include: a further 1,739 cases logged in Scotland on Wednesday, although that includes ""catch-up"" figures following problems with tests at the weekend an increase of 49 in the number of people in hospital, taking the total to 873 a further 28 deaths registered in the past 24 hours - the highest number reflected in the daily statistics since 21 May. Meanwhile,and figures from the National Records of Scotland,externalsaid Covid-19 had been mentioned on 75 death certificates in the week to Sunday, an increase of 50 on the week before. In her briefing, the first minister set out details of how the new five-tier system will work, saying the middle three would be ""broadly equivalent"" to the three-tier system in use in England. The Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom - which Ms Sturgeon said will be ""the closest to normality we can reasonably expect to live with until we have a vaccine"" - and one at the top. She said: ""When England published their system the chief medical officer at the time said he thought the top level was not enough to necessarily, in all circumstances, get the virus down. ""We think we need one above that, not identical to but perhaps close to a full lockdown, if things got to be that serious."" Bars and restaurants in Scotland's central belt were closed on 9 October The new five-tier framework will include details of financial support for businesses hit by enforced closures, which Ms Sturgeon said will be ""broadly similar"" to that on offer in other parts of the UK. She said: ""While the level of support we set out will be the maximum that the Scottish government is able to provide within the resources available to us, it is the minimum we think is necessary. ""In common with other devolved administrations and many councils in England we will continue to pursue urgent discussions with the Treasury about provision of adequate support to help businesses and individuals through the restrictions likely to be necessary in the time ahead."" Ms Sturgeon said the continuing rise in infections and deaths was ""clearly concerning"", but she believed it ""should not be taken as an indication that the current restrictions we are living under are not having any impact"". She said: ""We do believe these restrictions will make a difference, and we believe they may already be making a difference. Even allowing for today's figures, we may be seeing a reduction in the rate at which new cases are increasing."" Hospitality owners have protested about the current curbs The first minister discussed the new strategic framework with opposition party leaders on Tuesday. The Scottish Conservatives said the government must stop ""stalling"" and get support to businesses, saying they had been given ""barely any notice"" of the changes. Leader Douglas Ross said: ""There's a very real risk that the SNP take so long to get support out to these businesses that it will too little, too late. Promises of support sometime in the future won't protect Scottish jobs today."" Scottish Labour's Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon's administration ""must take the right action to control the virus"" as positive cases, hospital patients and deaths increase. He added that it was ""clear"" that the test and protect system was not working ""well enough"" to contain the virus, saying: ""We need the government to step up and ensure our testing and tracing system is fit for purpose"". Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he was worried about ""how things are developing"" and said the government needed to ""get on top of this situation"" if the virus was going to be curbed. He said: ""We have had four strategies in three weeks, starting with the route map then the 16 days of restrictions that has now turned into 23 days, and we will have the new strategy announced on Friday. It doesn't look like we're in control of the situation."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Brazil has been conducting trials of the vaccine Trials of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue, following a review into the death of a volunteer in Brazil. Brazil's health authority has given no details about the death, citing confidentiality protocols. Oxford University said a ""careful assessment"" had revealed no safety concerns. The BBC understands that the volunteer did not receive the vaccine. Only around half the volunteers in the trial are given the actual Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine. The second group are being given an existing licensed vaccine for meningitis. Neither the participants nor their families know which vaccine they are being given. This enables the researchers to compare the results for the two groups in order to measure whether the vaccine is effective. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Oxford University to resume Covid-19 vaccine trial Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response AstraZeneca said in a statement that it could not comment on individual cases but it ""can confirm that all required review processes have been followed"". ""All significant medical events are carefully assessed by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and the regulatory authorities,"" it said. ""These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study."" There are high hopes that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be one of the first to make it onto the market. It had successful phase 1 and 2 testing, while phase 3 testing is being carried out on participants in countries including the UK, Brazil and India. Trials of the Oxford vaccine were paused last month after a reported side effect in a patient in the UK, but wereresumed days laterwhen it was deemed safe to continue. Phase 3 trials in the US remain on hold while the regulator there conducts its own assessment. A senior official was quoted by Bloomberg on Wednesday as saying he expected US trials to restart later in the week. Brazil's health authority Anvisa said it was informed of the Brazilian volunteer's death on 19 October. Brazilian media report that the volunteer was a 28-year-old doctor who died of Covid-19 complications. They say the doctor had worked with infected patients. This has not been publicly confirmed by Anvisa. In a statement, Oxford University said: ""All significant medical incidents, whether participants are in the control group or the Covid-19 vaccine group, are independently reviewed. ""The independent review, in addition to the Brazilian regulator, have both recommended that the trial should continue,"" it said. Brazil has plans to purchase the vaccine if it is approved. The country has had nearly 5.3 million confirmed coronavirus cases - the third highest tally in the world after the US and India - and is second only to the US in terms of deaths, with nearly 155,000 registered so far, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to unveil new support for workers and firms hit by restrictions imposed as coronavirus cases rise across the UK. He is due to update the Job Support Scheme, which replaces furlough in November, in the Commons on Thursday. Critics say not enough is being done for firms in tier two areas that have seen demand collapse without being formally required to shut. In tier three areas, firms ordered to shut get emergency support. Talks were held throughout Wednesday, with the government said to have acknowledged that while there are three tiers of alert level - medium, high, and very high - there are only two tiers of support. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is changing after furlough? What Covid tier is my area in? Alert system explained... with cake Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, have complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argue that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. Top London-based chef Yotam Ottolenghi said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"". ""We are on our knees now,"" he told the BBC. ""We just don't have customers coming through the door."" He said that before tier two restrictions were imposed in London, his restaurants were operating at 50% of capacity, but that this had now fallen to between 10% and 20%. ""This is just not a viable place for a restaurant to be,"" he said, describing tier two as a ""cursed"" category that ""deprives us of oxygen"". In tier three areas, the government will pay 67% of affected workers' wages, up to Â£2,100 a month, from 1 November (""lockdown Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below). Some workers can also claimUniversal Credit. But in tier two regions, the only help available will be the standard JSS (""part-time Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below), which is more costly for employers. Business groups and unions say this means many firms will not be able to use it and will have to lay off workers instead. The chancellor's spokesperson said: ""What we have always said is that our package of support is always flexible, and always up for review, to make sure that it is dealing with the situation as it evolves."" Areas in tier two - the second-highest risk level - include London, Essex, much of the West Midlands, Leicester, Nottinghamshire, Cheshire, West Yorkshire and north-east England. Coventry is to move to tier two Covid restrictions from midnight on Friday, the city council has said. In addition to national restrictions meaning pubs and restaurants must close by 22:00, people in tier two areas are banned from mixing with other households indoors - hammering demand in many leisure industries. Key Conservative figures, such as West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, have been critical of the disparities, along with a raft of Labour local leaders and MPs. Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was ""one of the oddities of the system"" that pubs and restaurants in tier three areas which had been forced to close were in a better position than those in tier two areas which remained open. ""You get full support, whereas if you're in tier two, you get no more support than similar businesses in the rest of the country and yet demand for your products is clearly massively reduced,"" he added. Mr Johnson said it was clearly right that the government should seek to close that support gap with new measures. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC: ""We have a big distinction between tier one, tier two and tier three restrictions in theory, but the economic support packages don't go alongside those restrictions."" This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced As more parts of the country are placed in tier two, critics say the standard JSS is likely to fall short, with many fewer firms than expected signing up. Options being discussed in Whitehall include more generous taxpayer wage support for businesses in these regions, up from the current level of 22%, and grants offered through local authorities. With so much of England now in tier two, even small increases in support could end up being very expensive. Business and union leaders will be briefed on the changes on Thursday.

"The UK is ""ready to welcome the EU team"" to continue negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal, says No 10. The two sides' chief negotiators, Lord David Frost and Michel Barnier, spoke on the phone earlier after talks stalled last week. Following the conversation, Downing Street said the pair had ""jointly agreed a set of principles for handling this intensified phase of talks"". Lord Frost said talks would begin again in London on Thursday. The full statement from No 10 said it was ""clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas"" and it was ""entirely possible that negotiations will not succeed"". But, it added: ""We are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks."" Earlier, Mr Barnier said a deal would possible ""if we are both ready to work constructively and in a spirit of compromise over the next days, on the basis of legal texts. Time is short."" Are post-Brexit trade talks back on? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Boris Johnson's 22-minute Brexit call 'terrible' Both the UK and EU are calling on each other to compromise ahead of the looming December deadline for a deal. From 1 January 2021, the so-called transition period will be over, which has seen the UK continue to follow EU trading rules while a deal was negotiated. If an agreement is not reached, the UK will move onto trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization. Key areas of disagreement that remain between the two sides include fishing rights and post-Brexit competition rules. Lord Frost said these ""intensive talks"" will take place ""every day"" while the two sides see if a deal can be done. You could be forgiven for thinking that what we've witnessed over the past few days is a bit of political theatre. Cover for the government - post chest-beating- to return to the negotiating table where they know the time has now come for tough compromises to be made. EU leaders also went out of their way to sound tough on Brexit at their summit last week. Privately, a number of EU figures now admit it was a misstep. But EU leaders play to the domestic gallery too. They wanted to show they were ""standing up to the UK"" - that leaving the EU doesn't pay and that EU interests would be defended. They accept they must compromise too now, if this trade and security deal with the UK has a chance of being agreed. Time is short and trust is in low supply. Read more from Katya here The EU had previously set the end of October as a deadline to reach a deal, butBoris Johnson had pledged to walk away if it was not agreed by 15 October. The day after the prime minister's deadline, Mr Johnson said it was time to ""get ready"" to leave without a deal, with No 10 going further bysaying the talks were ""over"". A face-to-face meeting between the negotiators was cancelled for Monday and replaced by a phone call, which still left a stalemate between the two sides. But Wednesday's conversation appeared to have been more fruitful. Lord Frost (left) and Mr Barnier (right) have met several times since negotiations began in March No 10 said Mr Barnier had ""acknowledged"" the UK's demands for the EU to be ""serious about talking intensively, on all issues, and bringing the negotiation to a conclusion"" and that he had accepted he was dealing with ""an independent and sovereign country"". It also said the EU chief negotiator had accepted ""movement would be needed from both sides in the talks if agreement was to be reached"". The statement added: ""On the basis of that conversation we are ready to welcome the EU team to London to resume negotiations later this week. We have jointly agreed a set of principles for handling this intensified phase of talks. ""It is clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas, but we are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks."" Downing Street reiterated its pledge to leave the transition period without a deal - or on ""Australian terms"" - and called on businesses and travellers to prepare ""since change is coming, whether an agreement is reached or not"".

Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was ""one of the oddities of the system"" that pubs and restaurants in tier three areas which had been forced to close were in a better position than those in tier two areas which remained open. ""You get full support, whereas if you're in tier two, you get no more support than similar businesses in the rest of the country and yet demand for your products is clearly massively reduced,"" he added. Mr Johnson said it was clearly right that the government should seek to close that support gap with new measures. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC: ""We have a big distinction between tier one, tier two and tier three restrictions in theory, but the economic support packages don't go alongside those restrictions."" This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced As more parts of the country are placed in tier two, critics say the standard JSS is likely to fall short, with many fewer firms than expected signing up. Options being discussed in Whitehall include more generous taxpayer wage support for businesses in these regions, up from the current level of 22%, and grants offered through local authorities. With so much of England now in tier two, even small increases in support could end up being very expensive. Business and union leaders will be briefed on the changes on Thursday.

"KeolisAmey has run Transport for Wales rail services since October 2018 The Transport for Wales rail service is to be brought under Welsh Government control from next February. Ministers have confirmed the takeover from KeolisAmey, with day-to-day services to be run by a publicly-owned company. It follows significant falls in passenger numbers during the pandemic. The Welsh Tories questioned how much nationalisation will cost taxpayers, while Plaid Cymru called for the Senedd to be recalled. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the government had stepped in ""to stabilise the network and keep it running"". ""The last few months have been extremely challenging for public transport in Wales and across the UK. Covid has significantly impacted passenger revenues,"" he said. TfW rail customers 'among least satisfied in UK' Rail boss urges patience after first year KeolisAmey was awarded the franchise in 2018, taking over from Arriva Trains Wales. It covers most of Wales' trains - including key commuter services such as the Valley Lines. Transport for Wales will run Wales and Borders services from February The financial risk of the Wales and Borders rail franchise, which is branded Transport for Wales (TfW), had already been taken over by taxpayers under aÂ£65m agreement,externalsigned in May. But from February next year KeolisAmey staff working on rail services will be transferred over to a publicly owned company, currently called Transport for Wales Rail Ltd. It is happening under a part of railway law that allows for the creation of operators of ""last resort"". Officials say the time gap between now and the start of the new operator will allow the Welsh Government to prepare the new operator for service. A part of the original agreement is staying - Amey Keolis Infrastructure Ltd will continue to be responsible for infrastructure on the Core Valley Lines, where the South Wales Metro upgrade is taking place. Keolis and Amey will also work with the Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales on improvements to the service - like rolling stock and ticketing. Kevin Thomas, chief executive of KeolisAmey Wales, said: ""In light of Covid-19, we recognise the need for Welsh Government to have a sustainable way forward for delivering its ambitious objectives for rail."" KeolisAmey took over from Arriva Trains Wales in 2018 Challenged on the decision later on Thursday, Mr Skates told a Senedd committee that if the existing arrangements had continued it would have ""led to a collapse by the operator and a catastrophic transfer then to the operator of last resort [Transport for Wales Rail Ltd]. ""What we're able to do now is manage a careful transition, which will take us through to February, and then beyond, with the establishment of TfW rail limited,"" he said. Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters said: ""The whole business model collapsed in the face of Covid because the revenue was not coming in and Keolis in effect were not prepared to shoulder their share of the pain."" Asked about the long-term costs of propping up the network, he said: ""It depends on Covid. We don't know."" Ministers pledged to honour commitments worth more than Â£1bn to buy new trains and build the south Wales Metro. ""That will be delivered,"" Mr Skates said. James Price, chief executive of Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales which oversaw the franchise and shared branding with it, said that rolling stock is ""on the way"" and ""in essence is paid for already"". ""What this allows us to do is to reduce the profit we pay to the private sector massively over time, and make sure that when the revenue comes back, it comes back in to the taxpayer."" Russell George, economy spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Given the track record of the Welsh Labour-led Government, its decision to take control of our vital train industry has not filled me with any hope."" He said ministers should have consulted the Senedd on ""how much this decision is going to cost the Welsh taxpayer"". ""Eyebrows will be raised, too, on why any support is being left until February 2021,"" Mr George added. Plaid Cymru transport spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said it ""could well be the right decision"", saying her party ""has always maintained that our railways should be brought into public hands and the government put passengers before profit"". But she said there were ""crucial questions"" on financial implications and the nature of the subsidiary. ""Decisions of this importance should be announced in the Senedd so that members can ask questions on behalf of the people of Wales,"" she said. KeolisAmey already runs the Docklands Light Railway in London KeolisAmey is a joint-venture between two European companies, andwas awarded the Wales and Borders franchise in May 2018in a Â£5bn contract. It was the first time the Welsh Government had awarded the franchise. Keolis is France's largest private sector public transport operator - but its major shareholder is state-owned French railway SNCF. Amey is a former one-time UK company owned by Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial. KeolisAmey took over services in October 2018. In January it emerged it had beenfined Â£3.4m over the performance of services. Rail unions backed the move. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""There is huge public support for public ownership because privatisation and profiteering has never been an efficient way to provide value for money, and this is even more the case when extra funding has been needed during the coronavirus pandemic."" Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, said: ""This is a welcome and positive step from the Welsh Government, which will put our railways back in public hands and again shows the abject failure of privatisation."" We are told passengers will not notice the changeover. The same trains, staffed by the same drivers and conductors, will arrive at platforms. But there are new risks for the taxpayer. Ticket sales have plummeted. So in May the Welsh Government announced Â£65m and an emergency agreement to help the service cope. In practice, that means almost all the financial risks associated with the railway are borne by the government. Profits and losses have moved from the private sector into the public sector.

"Zara Radcliffe appeared in court via video link from Rampton secure hospital A woman who killed a man, 88, when he intervened to stop her attacking others in a supermarket has been detained under a hospital order. Zara Anne Radcliffe, 30, attacked John Rees at the Co-op in Penygraig on 5 May while suffering from schizophrenia. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard he tried to stop the attack in a ""brave act that ultimately cost him his life"". She pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. She had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of three others. Radcliffe - who appeared in court via video link from Rampton Hospital, a secure unit in Nottinghamshire - was told the order would not be time limited in order to protect the public. A person is detained as opposed to jailed if a court deems the individual has a mental disorder which needs assessment or treatment. Speaking after her sentencing, her father Wayne Radcliffe said he had called NHS staff and social services begging for his daughter to be readmitted on the morning of the attack, but no one came to help. John Rees was stabbed while his wife Eunice was sitting in a car outside Prosecution barrister Michael Jones QC told the court Mr Rees ""showed great courage"" as he tried to stop the attack in a ""selfless and brave act that ultimately cost him his life"". Lisa Way, 53, Gaynor Saurin, 65 and Andrew Price, 58, were also attacked by Radcliffe as they shopped at the Penygraig supermarket in Rhondda Cynon Taf. CCTV showed Radcliffe cross the road towards the supermarket before attacking Mr Price in the street as he left the shop. She jumped on his back and struck him to the head with a kitchen knife she had brought with her from home. CCTV showed Zara Radcliffe walking towards the Co-op store before the incident Mr Price managed to escape and ran away from her. The video evidence showed her enter the shop and continue the attack on Ms Saurin by repeatedly stabbing her head. Mr Rees attempted to intervene to stop her but was pushed to the floor and became the focus of the attack. Ms Way asked Radcliffe to stop what she was doing and talk and was stabbed in the neck before escaping to a nearby takeaway. A shop worker tried to drag Mr Rees away down one of the supermarket aisles but was stopped by Radcliffe who beat him with wine bottles and a fire extinguisher until he died from head injuries. Mr Rees's 87-year-old wife Eunice, who has dementia, was waiting in a car outside while he had gone shopping. When police arrived at the store Radcliffe said: ""It had to be done - that's it."" She told police she had heard voices telling her she had to kill someone to avoid being harmed herself. She said: ""I can't tell you about the voices in my head, they're so real."" Radcliffe had received treatment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital's mental health unit The court heard she had been admitted to the mental health unit at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital for just over a week in October 2019. She was readmitted on 12 November before being released on 24 February, having been assessed that she was at low risk of harm. The court heard she was not taking her medication at the time of the attack and her family had requested additional help for her. Radcliffe's barrister Jonathan Rees QC said she had suffered mental ill health since 2009. He said she was truly remorseful and expressed ""shame, horror and great regret"" at her actions. South Wales Police referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct after the incident The judge, Mrs Justice Jefford, told Radcliffe: ""It is highly unlikely you would have committed these offences if you had not been suffering from a severe mental illness. ""Having now received treatment and being in a more mentally stable condition you experience and have expressed genuine remorse for the actions you took that day. ""Tragic those actions were, treatment and not punishment is in my judgment the appropriate course."" Following the incident, South Wales Police referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct because of previous contact with Radcliffe but it concluded the force did not need to investigate. The court heard Radcliffe, from Porth, had called police in the hours before the attack claiming she had been attacked by someone else, but she did not remain in the same location for police to be able to speak to her. This video can not be played Wayne Radcliffe said his daughter's ""breakdown"" was a result of mental health failings Speaking following the sentencing, Radcliffe's father said he had phoned staff at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, social services and the psychiatrist team ""begging for help"", after noticing her mental health was deteriorating. Mr Radcliffe said he had rung between 08:00 until around 13:30 on the morning of the attack, telling them she was ""showing signs of a relapse"" and ""needed to be admitted to hospital as a matter of urgency"". ""[I said] 'can someone please come out as a matter of urgency, my daughter needs help', and nobody came,"" he said, ""nobody came to assist us"". In response, Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said it ""conducts rigorous reviews into all incidents to ensure that our practice and systems are changed or improved wherever necessary"". ""With legal proceedings in this case now concluded, we will continue at pace with this work,"" said a spokesperson. ""This is a distressing and tragic case, and we extend our condolences to the family and friends of the deceased, and to all of those involved in this sad incident in one of our communities. ""We are also offering support to anyone in the community who may have been affected by this incident."" Flowers and tributes were left at All Saints Church following the death of Mr Rees There was""disbelief""over the death of Mr Rees, a grandfather from Trealaw. He was described by his family as ""the very definition of a good man, extremely respected and liked in the community"". Mr Rees helped ring the church bells every Thursday for key workers during the coronavirus pandemic. In a victim impact statement, Mr Rees's son-in-law Patrick Davison Houston told the court he was a ""warm, generous and humble gentleman"". ""We are proud of his actions on that day but not surprised,"" he said.

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the highest Covid-19 alert level A Â£60m support package for businesses affected by new coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester will be distributed across the region. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the government will be giving the extra funding as the region goes into the highest tier on Friday. The move follows a breakdown in talks with local leaders who requested Â£90m but lowered their demand to Â£65m. Labour Mayor Andy Burnhamtold ITV News,externalhe has ""no regrets for taking a stand"". ""This wasn't a negotiation, this was basically bulldozed through and we took a stand,"" the Greater Manchester mayor said. Starmer attacks 'miserly' Johnson in Covid cash row South Yorkshire to move into tier 3 from Saturday What are Tier 3 rules for Manchester and South Yorkshire? Tier three restrictions 'worst of all worlds' ""So no regrets for taking that stand because the point is they were imposing an arbitrary formula one-by-one on places."" Greater Manchester is the first area to be forced into tier three, England's highest level of alert, against the wishes of local leaders. The Â£65m figure was described by Mr Burnham as the ""bare minimum to prevent a winter of real hardship"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the money offered to regions in the coronavirus crisis During Prime Minister's Question Time, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Mr Johnson for not being able to ""find"" Â£5m, adding ""stop bargaining with people's lives"". ""I think the Prime Minister has crossed a Rubicon here,"" he said. ""Not just with the miserly way he's treated Greater Manchester but in the grubby 'take it or leave' way these local deals are being done - it's corrosive to public trust."" But Mr Johnson said he was ""very proud that this government has already given Greater Manchester Â£1.1bn in support for business, Â£200m in extra un-ringfenced funding, Â£50m to tackle infections in care homes, Â£20m for test and trace, another Â£22m for local response that we announced yesterday"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has since written to the region's council leaders inviting them ""to work with us at pace to design their business support schemes"". He added that this will ""ensure the funding reaches the people and businesses who need it"". The Conservative leader of Bolton Council said he is willing to look at an individual deal over the government's offer of Â£60m. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown David Greenhalgh said: ""It is clear the amount on the table, which is what has been accepted in Liverpool [City Region], Lancashire and now South Yorkshire, and I am not prepared for Bolton businesses to miss out on this extra financial help. ""This is not the time for posturing and politics. This is about getting the best deal available for Bolton business and those who work in the sectors worst affected."" Meanwhile Manchester's night time economy adviser Sacha Lord has started the process to launch a legal challenge of the government's decision to put the region into the top tier. Hetweeted:,external""Last night we started the judicial review into the legality of implementing emergency restrictions on Greater Manchester's hospitality sector, without scientific evidence."" He said a ""pre-action letter has been filed"" and he is waiting for a response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

"Oxycontin has been widely abused The maker of OxyContin painkillers has reached an $8.3bn (Â£6.3bn) settlement and agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges to resolve a probe of its role in fuelling America's opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma will admit to enabling the supply of drugs ""without legitimate medical purpose"". The deal with US Department of Justice resolves some of the most serious claims against the firm. But it still faces thousands of cases brought by states and families. Purdue called the deal an ""essential"" step to wider resolution of the matter. ""Purdue deeply regrets and accepts responsibility for the misconduct detailed by the Department of Justice,"" said Steve Miller, who joined Purdue's board as chairman in July 2018, shortly before the firm sought protection from the litigation by filing for bankruptcy. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma files for bankruptcy Is this America's most hated family? The settlement with the DoJ must receive court approval to go forward. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case will be weighing how it will affect negotiations with other states and cities that have filed lawsuits against Purdue, many of which have already objected to the terms. Justice Department officials defended the deal as ""significant"" They say it lets the company and its owners, members of the Sackler family, off too lightly for their roles creating a crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 Americans since 1999. ""DoJ failed,"" said Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey after the settlement was announced. ""Justice in this case requires exposing the truth and holding the perpetrators accountable, not rushing a settlement to beat an election. I am not done with Purdue and the Sacklers, and I will never sell out the families who have been calling for justice for so long."" Allow Twitter content?

Justice Department officials defended the deal as ""significant"", noting that the department would forego much of the $8bn in fines, allowing the money to be directed to other creditors in the bankruptcy case - such as the communities ravaged by opioid abuse that have sued the company. They said they continue to review possible criminal charges against executives at the company and some members of the Sackler family. ""This resolution does not provide anybody with a pass on the criminal side,"" Rachel Honig, federal prosecutor for New Jersey said at a press conference. The settlement follows years of investigation into claims that Purdue and other drug-makers encouraged over-prescription of opioids, leading to overdoses and addiction which strained public health and policing resources in cities and towns across the US. Under the terms of the settlement, Purdue will admit to conspiring to defraud the US and violating anti-kickback laws in its distribution of the addictive painkillers. Those included payments the firm made to healthcare companies and doctors to encourage prescribing the drugs, which were ultimately paid for by public health programmes. Campaigners outside Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford in 2019 Purdue will pay $225m to the Justice Department and a further $1.7bn towards addressing claims made in other lawsuits. The settlement also includes a $3.54bn criminal fine and $2.8bn civil penalty, which will compete with other claims in bankruptcy court - such as those made by communities affected by the opioid crisis. It is unclear how much of that sum will actually be collected. Members of the Sackler family named in the lawsuits have also agreed to pay $225m and give up ownership of the firm. The company would reorganise as a new company run by a trust for the ""public benefit"". It would continue to produce OxyContin and other drugs aimed at treating addiction, with the government likely having a significant role. Purdue backed that idea in an earlier settlement proposal but it is opposed by many states, including Massachusetts. Along with the reorganisation as a ""public benefit"" firm, Purdue has proposed to settle the wider claims against it with a deal worth more than $10bn. But critics of the plan want to see the company sold and greater effort made to recover money from some members of the Sackler family.Court documents revealed last yearthat they had transferred more than $10bn out of the company between 2008 and 2017, as scrutiny of its conduct increased. Part of the Sackler family, which would commit $3bn to the wider settlement, said in a statement that members that had served on the Purdue board of directors had acted ""ethically and lawfully"" and that ""all financial distributions were proper"". ""We reached today's agreement in order to facilitate a global resolution that directs substantial funding to communities in need, rather than to years of legal proceedings,"" the family said.

"The numbers of hospital Covid infections has risen in the past week The number of hospital Covid infections has risen across Wales by 50% in the past week. Latest figures show the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, which covers the old Gwent region and Caerphilly county, has overtaken Cwm Taf Morgannwg for cases. Welsh Conservatives health spokesman Andrew RT Davies demanded an ""urgent inquiry"" into the rise and said the situation was out of control. Health Minister Vaughan Gething denied that it was. Plaid Cymru said the rise in infections was ""deeply concerning"". The party and the Welsh Conservativeshave demanded a probeinto outbreaks at the Cwm Taf health board, which has seen 57 deaths related to outbreaks. Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said health staff were doing ""everything possible"" to prevent the spread of infection. ""We're doing all that we can to prevent the spread of infection, thorough cleaning, thorough infection control measures, staff donning PPE, thorough cleaning between all patient contact,"" he said. Darren Hughes said health staff in Wales are facing ""enormous"" pressures Mr Hughes said there are around 900 patients reiving care for coronavirus in Welsh hospitals. ""The pressures that people are facing on the frontline are enormous,"" he added. ""Occasionally you do have staff who are asymptomatic with Covid or patients who are asymptomatic, and even though all possible actions are being taken to... prevent the spread, occasionally these things do happen,"" he said. Latest figures from Public Health Wales on Covid-19 infections caught in hospital - 142 - show the largest weekly number since the end of April. Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend, has seen a drop in cases reported in the most recent week and it has been overtaken by Aneurin Bevan. Swansea Bay health board also reported 25 cases in the week to 18 October, Hywel Dda in west Wales has 15 cases, there are 10 in north Wales and just one in Cardiff and Vale. The figures cover the week ending 18 October. Overall, 95% of Covid-19 infections occur in the community - only 5% are caught within hospitals. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board this weekreported 10 further deaths related to hospital infections. Bronglais hospital patients isolating after Covid diagnoses Five more deaths at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were reported earlier this week Andrew RT Davies said: ""Despite the health minister's denials, it's quite clear that hospital acquired infections are now out of control in the Labour-run Welsh NHS. ""After the first Covid outbreak at Wrexham Maelor in September, Vaughan Gething admitted the situation could have been managed better and that lessons would be learnt, but this has clearly not been the case."" He said the problem was the ""biggest we currently face and is directly linked to the increasing Covid demand on our NHS"". ""Financial resource, manpower and testing capability needs to be directed at this particular hot-spot, as well as ensuring Covid-light areas and field hospitals are up and running to protect patients and staff,"" he added. In a letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price raised as a ""matter of urgency"" the ""deeply concerning"" figures. In the letter, he draws Mr Drakeford's attention to several points passed in a Senedd vote on Tuesday night - including a call for a strategy to eliminate Covid, a review of hospital infection control policies and to consider establishing designated Covid-19 free sites. ""Addressing the safety of hospitals for those currently being treated and those who await hospital admission is paramount if we are to see a reduction in the number of cases in hospital and give people confidence to proceed with attending non-Covid treatments and appointments,"" he said. ""I would be grateful if you could outline how both matters are being addressed and when we can expect the detail of any ongoing work to be made public."" The rise in the number of people catching coronavirus in hospital is certainly a big concern, especially the rate of increase. There will be questions asked about the strength of infection control measures, for example the procedures for testing patients as they come into hospital, and the measures to segregate Covid patients from others. And, of course, we've heard opposition parties call for inquiries and accuse the Welsh Government of taking its eye off the ball. But people getting infected in hospital is not a new phenomenon in this pandemic. Although there have been steep rises recently, rates were far higher in the spring. The difference is we just couldn't see it clearly then. The statistics weren't being published and there were so many new cases in a short period of time that it was hard to distinguish where and how people were becoming infected. In a way, rising rates of hospital infections is another indicator of what is already obvious: Covid-19 is spreading quickly and the situation is serious. In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Gething said: ""I don't think it's out of control but it's a real risk. ""Because we're seeing a significant increase in community transmission across the country, and of course our staff live within those communities. ""So the point about contact is that it affects all of us in all particular areas of work."" The Welsh Government hopes the national lockdown,coming into effect on Friday, ""will allow us to get that under control in terms of reducing the transmission of coronavirus, and it should mean we have more control in all of our environments"".

"Prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said the two students had described Samuel Paty to the killer Two students were paid to identify a teacher to the man who beheaded him last Friday in an attack that shocked France, prosecutors have alleged. Samuel Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty. The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference. He said Anzorov had told them he wanted ""to humiliate him, to hit him"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack. The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign that was orchestrated against Mr Paty. The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack. Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had faced threats for showing the cartoons He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons. The prosecutor's revelations come ahead of a national memorial service in Paris for Mr Paty. President Emmanuel Macron will attend the event at the Sorbonne University on Wednesday evening, along with the teacher's family and some 400 guests. He is expected to posthumously give Mr Paty France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur, Earlier, the president held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged co-operation in fighting terrorism. Mr Putin described the attack as a ""barbarous murder"". Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008. Mr Macron said he wanted to see a ""strengthening of Franco-Russian co-operation in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration"", the French presidency said. Russia has played down any association with the attacker. ""This person had lived in France for the past 12 years,"" a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris told the Tass news agency on Saturday. Police have raided some 40 homes following the attack, and the government also ordered a mosque to close for six months. The Pantin mosque, just north of Paris, was closed after it emerged it had shared videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty. In one clip, posted just days before the attack, it also shared his school's address. This video can not be played French minister: Lessons on freedom of expression will continue The mosque later expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing. Meanwhile, mosques in the south-western cities of Bordeaux and Beziers were put under police protection after they reported threats. ""Such actions are unacceptable on the soil of the Republic,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said in a tweet on Wednesday. On Tuesday, President Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing. He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community from the influence of radicalism. Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October. The history and geography teacher advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Charlie Hebdo republishes Muhammad cartoons Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Watch: Violence and hostility inside the French police Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslimsbecause Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication. This video can not be played Rallies in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty France's Muslim community, which is Europe's largest, comprises about 10% of the population. Some French Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.

Do join us again tomorrow. As our coverage heads to a close, here are some of the headlines from across the UK and the rest of the world today: Spain has surpassed one million coronavirus cases, its health ministry says. It means it is the first country in western Europe to have more than a million total cases, at 1,005,295. The country's death toll rose to 34,366 on Wednesday. Tunisia only has 181 intensive care unit beds Tunisiaâs health minister has warned that intensive care
units in the countryâs public hospitals are about 80% full. Fouzi Mehdi told reporters that the country only has 181
intensive care unit beds â 145 are now being used. Tunisia is seeing a rise in the number of cases and
has now reported a total of 45,000 infections and 740 deaths since the
pandemic began. Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn has tested positive for coronavirus and is quarantining at home, the government says. Infection rates in the country have been rising in recent weeks, and they hit a daily record of
7,830 new cases on Saturday. Microbrewery manager Dave Hughes says the restrictions mean a lot of ""stress"" Business owners in South Yorkshire have expressed concerns about their survivalas news came today that they will face tighter coronavirus restrictions. Jamie Hawksworth, who owns the Sheffield Tap, says he saw the new restrictions coming and they will be ""devastating"" for his staff. ""We've had the entire business pulled from under us,"" he says. ""We're basically being thrown under the bus, we're the scapegoat."" The family-run Acorn Brewery in Wombwell, Barnsley, is facing similar worries. The microbrewery's managing director Dave Hughes says the business was operating at about 20% of the level it was at before the pandemic and its team has been cut from 11 to four. Mr Hughes also runs a real ale pub which will have to close under the new restrictions. ""We can't offer a substantial meal. A lots of pubs that don't have a food offering will suffer and those that do - well will they get the footfall?"" Lockdown had a major impact on the UK's mental health, including increased rates of suicidal thoughts, according to new research. The study, led by the University of Glasgow, examined the effects of Covid-19 during the height of the pandemic. Its findings suggested certain groups were particularly at risk, including young people and women. This publication is the most detailed examination of how the UK's adult population coped during the first weeks of lockdown, when people were given strict orders to stay at home. Researchers say public health measures, like lockdowns, are necessary to protect the general population, but warn they may have a ""profound and long-lasting"" effect on mental health and will extend beyond those who have been affected by the virus. The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at three blocks of time between March 31 and May 11. Just over 3,000 adults in the UK were surveyed and a range of mental health factors were considered, including depression, loneliness, suicide attempts and self-harm. The Department of Health in England said it was increasing investment in mental health services. If you need support on mental health, there is more informationhere. And theSamaritans,externalcan be contacted for free, 24 hours a day, on 116 123. Poland recorded a record 10,040 daily cases on Wednesday Poland says it will announce new restrictions on
Thursday after reporting a record 10,040 new cases in a single day. The infection rate has doubled in less than three weeks. On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament held an
emergency session to discuss a bill to help the countryâs health system,
Reuters news agency reports. Government spokesman Piotr Muller said the government
will decide whether to move the teaching of older pupils in primary schools
online. It comes as the governmentâs Covid-19 adviser Andrzej
Horban told local radio that the health system can only cope with a maximum of
10,000 new cases a day. With further restrictions in place across large areas of the UK, the government is spending more and more on measures to support local economies. But how much is this likely to cost the UK? Well, we won't really know how big the final bill will be until after the crisis is over. But the government will certainly have to borrow enormous amounts of money. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR),external, which keeps tabs on public spending, the government will have to borrow Â£372bn for the current financial year, (April 2020 to April 2021). And that's before the cost of new lockdowns and support measures announced in the autumn are considered. To put it into context: before the crisis, the government was expecting to borrow about Â£55bn for the whole financial year, but it has already borrowedÂ£208.5bn so far this year. Up to 7 August, the total cost of measures announced to combat Covid-19 was Â£210bn,according to the National Audit Office,external. For more on the sums,read on here. The UK government has announced there have been a further 26,688 daily coronavirus cases. Another 191 people died within 28 days of positive test, it said, taking the UK's total to 44,158. BBC Radio 5 Live Pub landlord Paul Foster From Saturday, South Yorkshire will follow Liverpool, Lancashire and Greater Manchester into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Paul Foster is the landlord of two pubs in Sheffield, the Norfolk Arms and the Red Lion. He told BBC Radio 5 Live his pubs would be staying open. âPurely because the bit of research we have done into the support package is that itâs negligent; it doesnât cover anything. So weâll stay open and do our best to serve our community,"" he said. âOctoberâs always a difficult month to trade in anyway, as people need a reason to come out, and at the moment theyâve got a reason to stay away, so itâs been a challenging month. ""We always try to work on the front foot, so weâve sustained trade at the moment. If there are quite a lot of pubs shutting down, do we increase our market by staying open?â âAs a publican, I donât understand what the negotiations are about. If weâre having to close places down because of health, close places down because of health.""  Labourâs deputy leader Angela Rayner has been rebuked by the deputy Speaker after the word âscumâ was heard in the Commons. Dame Eleanor Laing intervened after Tory MP Chris Clarkson asked if Ms Rayner had used the word about him as âthat is what I heardâ. Ms Rayner complained that the Tory MP said something inaccurate in his speech in a debate on support for areas under extra Covid restrictions. This video can not be played Clarkson, Rayner and Laing on 'scum' comment in Commons A member of the UK government's scientific advisory group has told MPs that people will have to learn to live with the virus ""forever more"". Epidemiologist Prof John Edmunds said it was an ""almost certainty"" that a vaccine will help to manage the epidemic in the ""not-too-distant future"". But he also said: ""There is very little chance that it's going to become eradicated."" He also warned the second Covid-19 wave would lead to tens of thousands of deaths. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told a select committee things were ""getting to the point where the health service will be under strain in much of the North in the next few weeks"". He said: ""There's no way we come out of this wave now without counting our deaths in the tens of thousandsâ The royal family came under criticism for going on holiday during a partial lockdown The Dutch royal family say they regret
going on holiday during a partial lockdown in the Netherlands. King Willem-Alexander went on
holiday to Greece on Saturday along with his wife and children. They returned a
day later following a public outcry. Speaking in a video, the King said: âOur
journey to Greece has provoked strong reactions from many Dutch people. It
hurts to have betrayed your trust in us.â Last week The Netherlands entered a
partial lockdown. All bars and restaurants are closed for four weeks. The government urged people to limit international travel. ""Even though the journey was in
line with the regulations, it was very unwise not to take into account the
impact of the new restrictions on our community,"" the King said. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has come
under fire for allowing the family to go. He admitted on Sunday that a âwrong
assessmentâ was made by not stopping them from going on holiday. We've been hearing today about the stricter coronavirus measures coming into place for South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. But the effects will take two or three weeks to show if top-tier coronavirus restrictions are working in a region, MPs have heard. Dr Clare Gardiner, director general of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) told two select committees that it would take that long for the data to come through, with part of the lag due to the virus having a 10-day incubation period. She added: ""We also are looking really keenly at the number of people being admitted to hospital. ""We are particularly concerned and will be looking closely at case rates in the over-60s and watching quite carefully the information about outbreaks in care homes, so looking to protect and being able to protect the vulnerable."" When asked about the criteria used to raise an area from tier two to tier three, Dr Gardiner said there were a ""basket of indicators"" which were looked at with the chief medical officer who would then make recommendations to ministers. These included having a rate of more than 100-150 cases a week per 100,000 people, case rates among the over-60s, a positivity rate in tests of more than 7.5% and the number of people being admitted to hospital. The prime minister has ""crossed the Rubicon"" with the ""miserly"" way he has treated Greater Manchester, Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions. After the Labour leader called for an end to the âendless local battlesâ over imposing tough restrictions, Boris Johnson said he was proud of the ""one-nation support"" the government has given throughout the virus pandemic. And the prime minister also accused him of wanting to âturn the lights out with a full national lockdownâ. This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on Manchester Covid payments Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed that employees of closed businesses in tier three areas will get 80% of their income. This is important because the furlough scheme, which closes at the end of October, made sure such workers received 80% of their wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500. But theJob Support Scheme, which will replace it in November, will provide 67% of normal salary up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month. It is certainly the case that some workers on low incomes will get at least 80% of their usual wages. In particular, people whose wages were low enough for them to qualify for Universal Credit before their employers were forced to close, are likely to get at least 80% of their wages. But it is also the case that some workers will get less than 80%. The point is that the prime minister failed to mention those who do not get UC at all, or only get a bit of it, who would receive less than 80% of their usual income. Read our full Reality Check here. Twelve members of a football team have been fined after claiming they were from the same household while drinking in a pub. They were in the Wouldhave in South Shields, South Tyneside, when staff members challenged them after seeing their football kit under their jackets, said pub chain JD Wetherspoon. Northumbria Police said the member of staff reported a breach of the coronavirus regulations, and officers arrived at the pub. The group was fined Â£200 each, which will be halved if it is paid within a fortnight. Ch Supt Janice Hutton of Northumbria Police, said: ""This group showed a flagrant disregard for the rules which are in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus."" The Wetherspoon spokesman said the group had been asked if they were from the same household and that they had said yes. But player Josh Robertson, one of the those who was fined, denied that version of events. He told the PA news agency: ""They didn't ask if we lived in the same house. Why would 12 lads say we lived in the same house?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasclaimed that Transport for London (TfL) was ""effectively bankrupted""before the coronavirus pandemic after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan accused the government of ""draconian"" demands in exchange for a bailout. The prime minister said any increase in fares was ""entirely the responsibility"" of Khan who he said had ""left a massive black hole in its finances"". But Khan called Johnson a ""liar"" and said he had successfully reduced the deficit, which he said was accrued by the prime minister when he was mayor in 2016, by 71%. ""Covid-19 is the sole cause of TfL's challenges. The PM wants to increase fares, the C-Charge and taxes and end free travel for children and older Londoners,"" hetweeted.,external The mayor said government proposals for a second bail-out of TfL include higher council taxes, an expanded congestion charge zone and a hike in Tube and bus fares. The Department for Transport said talks over a settlement were continuing. TfL bosses have asked for a Â£5.7bn package to prop up services for the next 18 months, after passenger numbers and revenues plummeted in the aftermath the March lockdown. In May, the government granted TfL Â£1.6bn in emergency funding to keep services running. Â© 2025 BBC.

Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told a select committee things were ""getting to the point where the health service will be under strain in much of the North in the next few weeks"". He said: ""There's no way we come out of this wave now without counting our deaths in the tens of thousandsâ The royal family came under criticism for going on holiday during a partial lockdown The Dutch royal family say they regret
going on holiday during a partial lockdown in the Netherlands. King Willem-Alexander went on
holiday to Greece on Saturday along with his wife and children. They returned a
day later following a public outcry. Speaking in a video, the King said: âOur
journey to Greece has provoked strong reactions from many Dutch people. It
hurts to have betrayed your trust in us.â Last week The Netherlands entered a
partial lockdown. All bars and restaurants are closed for four weeks. The government urged people to limit international travel. ""Even though the journey was in
line with the regulations, it was very unwise not to take into account the
impact of the new restrictions on our community,"" the King said. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has come
under fire for allowing the family to go. He admitted on Sunday that a âwrong
assessmentâ was made by not stopping them from going on holiday. We've been hearing today about the stricter coronavirus measures coming into place for South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. But the effects will take two or three weeks to show if top-tier coronavirus restrictions are working in a region, MPs have heard. Dr Clare Gardiner, director general of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) told two select committees that it would take that long for the data to come through, with part of the lag due to the virus having a 10-day incubation period. She added: ""We also are looking really keenly at the number of people being admitted to hospital. ""We are particularly concerned and will be looking closely at case rates in the over-60s and watching quite carefully the information about outbreaks in care homes, so looking to protect and being able to protect the vulnerable."" When asked about the criteria used to raise an area from tier two to tier three, Dr Gardiner said there were a ""basket of indicators"" which were looked at with the chief medical officer who would then make recommendations to ministers. These included having a rate of more than 100-150 cases a week per 100,000 people, case rates among the over-60s, a positivity rate in tests of more than 7.5% and the number of people being admitted to hospital. The prime minister has ""crossed the Rubicon"" with the ""miserly"" way he has treated Greater Manchester, Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions. After the Labour leader called for an end to the âendless local battlesâ over imposing tough restrictions, Boris Johnson said he was proud of the ""one-nation support"" the government has given throughout the virus pandemic. And the prime minister also accused him of wanting to âturn the lights out with a full national lockdownâ. This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on Manchester Covid payments Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed that employees of closed businesses in tier three areas will get 80% of their income. This is important because the furlough scheme, which closes at the end of October, made sure such workers received 80% of their wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500. But theJob Support Scheme, which will replace it in November, will provide 67% of normal salary up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month. It is certainly the case that some workers on low incomes will get at least 80% of their usual wages. In particular, people whose wages were low enough for them to qualify for Universal Credit before their employers were forced to close, are likely to get at least 80% of their wages. But it is also the case that some workers will get less than 80%. The point is that the prime minister failed to mention those who do not get UC at all, or only get a bit of it, who would receive less than 80% of their usual income. Read our full Reality Check here. Twelve members of a football team have been fined after claiming they were from the same household while drinking in a pub. They were in the Wouldhave in South Shields, South Tyneside, when staff members challenged them after seeing their football kit under their jackets, said pub chain JD Wetherspoon. Northumbria Police said the member of staff reported a breach of the coronavirus regulations, and officers arrived at the pub. The group was fined Â£200 each, which will be halved if it is paid within a fortnight. Ch Supt Janice Hutton of Northumbria Police, said: ""This group showed a flagrant disregard for the rules which are in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus."" The Wetherspoon spokesman said the group had been asked if they were from the same household and that they had said yes. But player Josh Robertson, one of the those who was fined, denied that version of events. He told the PA news agency: ""They didn't ask if we lived in the same house. Why would 12 lads say we lived in the same house?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasclaimed that Transport for London (TfL) was ""effectively bankrupted""before the coronavirus pandemic after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan accused the government of ""draconian"" demands in exchange for a bailout. The prime minister said any increase in fares was ""entirely the responsibility"" of Khan who he said had ""left a massive black hole in its finances"". But Khan called Johnson a ""liar"" and said he had successfully reduced the deficit, which he said was accrued by the prime minister when he was mayor in 2016, by 71%. ""Covid-19 is the sole cause of TfL's challenges. The PM wants to increase fares, the C-Charge and taxes and end free travel for children and older Londoners,"" hetweeted.,external The mayor said government proposals for a second bail-out of TfL include higher council taxes, an expanded congestion charge zone and a hike in Tube and bus fares. The Department for Transport said talks over a settlement were continuing. TfL bosses have asked for a Â£5.7bn package to prop up services for the next 18 months, after passenger numbers and revenues plummeted in the aftermath the March lockdown. In May, the government granted TfL Â£1.6bn in emergency funding to keep services running. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the highest Covid-19 alert level A Â£60m support package for businesses affected by new coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester will be distributed across the region. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the government will be giving the extra funding as the region goes into the highest tier on Friday. The move follows a breakdown in talks with local leaders who requested Â£90m but lowered their demand to Â£65m. Labour Mayor Andy Burnhamtold ITV News,externalhe has ""no regrets for taking a stand"". ""This wasn't a negotiation, this was basically bulldozed through and we took a stand,"" the Greater Manchester mayor said. Starmer attacks 'miserly' Johnson in Covid cash row South Yorkshire to move into tier 3 from Saturday What are Tier 3 rules for Manchester and South Yorkshire? Tier three restrictions 'worst of all worlds' ""So no regrets for taking that stand because the point is they were imposing an arbitrary formula one-by-one on places."" Greater Manchester is the first area to be forced into tier three, England's highest level of alert, against the wishes of local leaders. The Â£65m figure was described by Mr Burnham as the ""bare minimum to prevent a winter of real hardship"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the money offered to regions in the coronavirus crisis During Prime Minister's Question Time, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Mr Johnson for not being able to ""find"" Â£5m, adding ""stop bargaining with people's lives"". ""I think the Prime Minister has crossed a Rubicon here,"" he said. ""Not just with the miserly way he's treated Greater Manchester but in the grubby 'take it or leave' way these local deals are being done - it's corrosive to public trust."" But Mr Johnson said he was ""very proud that this government has already given Greater Manchester Â£1.1bn in support for business, Â£200m in extra un-ringfenced funding, Â£50m to tackle infections in care homes, Â£20m for test and trace, another Â£22m for local response that we announced yesterday"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has since written to the region's council leaders inviting them ""to work with us at pace to design their business support schemes"". He added that this will ""ensure the funding reaches the people and businesses who need it"". The Conservative leader of Bolton Council said he is willing to look at an individual deal over the government's offer of Â£60m. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown David Greenhalgh said: ""It is clear the amount on the table, which is what has been accepted in Liverpool [City Region], Lancashire and now South Yorkshire, and I am not prepared for Bolton businesses to miss out on this extra financial help. ""This is not the time for posturing and politics. This is about getting the best deal available for Bolton business and those who work in the sectors worst affected."" Meanwhile Manchester's night time economy adviser Sacha Lord has started the process to launch a legal challenge of the government's decision to put the region into the top tier. Hetweeted:,external""Last night we started the judicial review into the legality of implementing emergency restrictions on Greater Manchester's hospitality sector, without scientific evidence."" He said a ""pre-action letter has been filed"" and he is waiting for a response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Andy Burnham said he hoped to set a Covid-19 funding template for other areas to use After talks broke down between local leaders and the government, six Tory MPswrote to Mr Burnham,externalaccusing him of putting his ""ego"" above the people of Greater Manchester. Oldham Council leader Sean Fielding said: ""It wasn't just Andy Burnham that rejected the offer of Â£60m, it was collectively the 10 council leaders and Andy Burnham."" ""Â£60m was not enough and it remains not enough,"" added the Labour councillor. The Labour leader of Bury Council Eamonn O'Brien alsoresponded to the letter,,externalsaying: ""This is about our collective fight to get the best possible deal for our businesses and residents, especially those on the lowest pay."" But Mr Burnham said ""we asked for Â£90m - which is the cost of an 80% furlough & self-employed scheme"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played More than a dozen people have been evacuated from nearby properties Two people have been killed in a suspected gas explosion at a shop in west London, firefighters have said. The blast happened in a hair salon and mobile phone shop on King Street, Southall, just after 06:30 BST. Four adults and a child are known to have been rescued by the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Earlier, the Metropolitan Police said one man was found injured. The blast is not being treated as suspicious, the force said. The explosion has damaged the Dr Phone shop and the Chandla Hair Salon on King Street Station Commander Paul Morgan said: ""Our crews continue to search the property using specialist equipment including the use of urban search-and-rescue dogs. ""We can confirm that sadly two people have died at the scene. ""The explosion caused substantial damage to the shop and structural damage throughout. ""It is a painstaking and protracted incident with firefighters working systematically to stabilise the building and search for people involved."" London Fire Brigade sent about 40 firefighters to the scene LFB said search and rescue operations have finished for the evening and will restart in the morning. Jatinder Sing, the owner of Dr Phone, said he was in ""total shock"" when he received a call about the blast. The 36-year-old said: ""They have closed off everything. It seems like an explosion of a gas cylinder and there is a flat upstairs and my shop is downstairs. ""I was shocked because my shop looks totally dead, finished and the same with the barber. ""I can't see anything from where I am standing apart from the the shutter and the main door, which is all trashed. ""I have lost my everything.

The 38-year-old said: ""The house shook, and I turned to my husband and said 'what is that?' ""And he said, 'It's a blast' and he went to look after taking the children to school - he said it was at a phone shop."" Mohammad Rafiq, 78, who lives two streets away, said he and his 76-year-old wife felt ""shocked"" and ""scared"" when the noise from the King Street blast woke them at their home.

"Royal Mail will start collecting parcels and mail from people's homes from Wednesday as it tries to grab a bigger share of the parcel market. The firm is trying to capitalise on a rise in online shopping which has been accelerated by the coronavirus crisis. Royal Mail has seen parcel deliveries increase in recent years but is still on track to make a loss in 2020. The move to collecting could be beneficial if the company can work out logistical issues, an analyst said. Royal Mail, which already delivers parcels, is joining an already crowded parcel-collection market where it faces rivals such as DPD, Hermes and DHL. Its Parcel Collect service, which has been trialled in parts of the west of England, will be available every day except Sunday, and there will be 72p charge per parcel, plus postage costs. Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Royal Mail set for 'material loss' despite jump in parcels Pre-paid return packages can be collected for 60p per item. People running their own business from home will be able to use the service, along with consumers, a Royal Mail spokesperson said. The firm said it was ""one of the biggest changes to the daily delivery since the launch of the post box in 1852"". By Ramzan Karmali Royal Mail says it has found a solution for its customers who have parcels to send but can't face the queues in their local post office. The firm's new ""Parcel Collect""  service will operate six days a week and you'll be able to send up to five parcels at a time. Your local postman or postwoman will either collect your parcels from your front door or a designated safe space and the service will be part of their daily round. To use the service you have to book online (www.royalmail.com/bookcollection or via their app) - this can be done from five days in advance up to midnight the day before collection. Customers will have to make sure their postage is paid for, print their own labels and then pay for the service online. The charge for using the service is 72p per parcel, in addition to postage costs. Parcel Collect is also available for pre-paid return items at a cost of 60p per item. The firm is under pressure to find new revenue lines after seeing the number of letters it delivers halve over the last 16 years due to the popularity of email. During that time its parcel deliveries have increased greatly, and it now hopes to tap into the booming returns market, as online shoppers seek to change items bought online. The company had already made moves to enter the parcel market, launching parcel post boxes last year. However, historically Royal Mail has underinvested in its parcel services, and only launched automated parcel sorting in 2017, according to Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett. Mr Hyett said the new service would see a ""massive increase"" in its capacity, which would require a ""significant amount of investment"" and a ""high degree of planning and organisation"" which had sometimes been lacking. However, he said that if Royal Mail managed to get it right, it could help mitigate losses it incurs through its obligation to provide a ""universal service"" across the UK. For example, currently it must deliver to more isolated places in the UK which drags on its profits. But being able to collect from those locations could help it maximise its returns, Mr Hyett said.

"This video can not be played More than a dozen people have been evacuated from nearby properties Two people have been killed in a suspected gas explosion at a shop in west London, firefighters have said. The blast happened in a hair salon and mobile phone shop on King Street, Southall, just after 06:30 BST. Four adults and a child are known to have been rescued by the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Earlier, the Metropolitan Police said one man was found injured. The blast is not being treated as suspicious, the force said. The explosion has damaged the Dr Phone shop and the Chandla Hair Salon on King Street Station Commander Paul Morgan said: ""Our crews continue to search the property using specialist equipment including the use of urban search-and-rescue dogs. ""We can confirm that sadly two people have died at the scene. ""The explosion caused substantial damage to the shop and structural damage throughout. ""It is a painstaking and protracted incident with firefighters working systematically to stabilise the building and search for people involved."" London Fire Brigade sent about 40 firefighters to the scene LFB said search and rescue operations have finished for the evening and will restart in the morning. Jatinder Sing, the owner of Dr Phone, said he was in ""total shock"" when he received a call about the blast. The 36-year-old said: ""They have closed off everything. It seems like an explosion of a gas cylinder and there is a flat upstairs and my shop is downstairs. ""I was shocked because my shop looks totally dead, finished and the same with the barber. ""I can't see anything from where I am standing apart from the the shutter and the main door, which is all trashed. ""I have lost my everything. We were struggling from the coronavirus period as well - too much stock in the shop and no sales for a long time so I don't know how we will survive."" Rescuers are involved in a ""complex"" search for anyone who might still be inside the collapsed building Resident Nurmila Hamid who lives nearby said she felt the blast as she was getting her children ready for school. The 38-year-old said: ""The house shook, and I turned to my husband and said 'what is that?' ""And he said, 'It's a blast' and he went to look after taking the children to school - he said it was at a phone shop."" Mohammad Rafiq, 78, who lives two streets away, said he and his 76-year-old wife felt ""shocked"" and ""scared"" when the noise from the King Street blast woke them at their home. He said: ""I heard it in the morning - it woke me up, it was scary. It sounded like a very dangerous blast so I was scared. ""We didn't sleep after that."" BBC London's Guy Lynn Sixteen people are known to have been evacuated from nearby properties I have counted 25 firefighters here sifting through the wreckage on King Street with the police this morning. The explosion has also shut off a number of streets, with the police on the scene to prevent people approaching the scene. It is a clear scene of devastation of several shops and flats, which the London Fire Brigade have called a ""structural collapse"". Sadly, it looks as though the explosion may have claimed a few lives. A further 14 adults and two children evacuated themselves from nearby properties after the blast. LFB was called at 06:38 and sent about 40 firefighters to the scene. It advised people to avoid the King Street area while the search continues. A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said paramedics had treated and discharged one person. Ealing Council said it had switched off the electricity and gas supply to some homes and businesses in the area and warned more properties might need to be evacuated.

"The end of cheaper restaurant meals pushed UK prices up last month after the Eat Out to Help Out scheme expired. The UK's inflation rate, which tracks the prices of goods and services, climbed to 0.5% in September, from 0.2% in August. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) began rising more quickly in September after the discount meals scheme ended, pushing up restaurant and cafÃ© prices, Transport costs also went up as demand for second-hand cars increased. In catering services, prices rose 4.1% between August and September 2020, compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same two months in 2019. Transport costs rose for the first time since March, partly because the price of second-hand cars was boosted by increased demand as people, reportedly, looked to reduce their reliance on public transport, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The price of second-hand cars, climbed 2.1% between August and September 2020, compared with a 1.4% fall between the same two months a year ago. Average petrol prices also rose to 113.3p per litre in September 2020, up from 113.1 pence in August. However, that was still some way below the 127.3p recorded in September 2019. The drop in the cost of air fares usually seen in the September inflation index had much less effect this year, according to Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""Air fares would normally fall substantially at this time due to the end of the school holidays, but with prices subdued this year, as fewer people have been travelling abroad, the price drop has been less significant,"" he said. UK job losses 'could be larger than forecast' UK facing 'unprecedented economic uncertainty' Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that in the light of continued low inflation, the Bank of England was likely to increase its monetary stimulus measures next month to boost the ailing economy. ""With CPI inflation just 0.5% in September, it's hard to think of reasons why the Bank of England won't launch another Â£100bn or so of QE at the November meeting. Anddespite public borrowing still jumping, the government may yet spend more,"" he said. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. September's CPI is used in the calculation for state pensions, but the government's triple-lock rule means the increase will be 2.5%, as it's the highest figure out of CPI, earnings growth for the year to July (which was actually negative), or 2.5%. State benefits are also decided by the September inflation figure, meaning payments will rise 0.5% next April, which is far less than this year's 1.7% increase. The September figure is also used to decide the annual increase in business rates. ""Today's headline rate of inflation of 0.5% signals that gross business rates bills next year for 2021-22 will increase by Â£159.42m in England,"" said real estate adviser Altus Group. Business rates are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK state pension is expected to rise by 2.5% in April, owing to calculations guiding the government's triple-lock promise. With average earnings lower than a year earlier (based on official figures for May to July), and now the inflation rate only having risen slightly, the backstop of a 2.5% increase kicks in. This follows three years of higher rises and is well down on the 3.9% increase seen in April this year. Although it is still to be officially confirmed, it should mean: The new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) should go up by Â£4.40 a week from Â£175.20 a week at present to Â£179.60Â a week in April The old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) should go up by Â£3.35 a week from Â£134.25 a week now to Â£137.60 a week in April The expected increase could reignite debate over fairness between the generations. On one hand, the rise will seem high to those who have lost jobs during the pandemic, but the UK state pension remains one of the least generous in western economies. The age at which people now start to receive the UK state pension recently hit 66 for men and women. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Pubs in South Yorkshire will only be allowed to stay open if they serve a ""substantial meal"" Business owners in South Yorkshire fear for their survival prospects as they face tighter coronavirus restrictions. Tier three restrictions will apply in the area from 00:01 on Saturday,it has been confirmed. The rules impose further restrictions on households mixing, while pubs that do not serve substantial meals must close. One pub owner in Sheffield says the hospitality sector has been ""thrown under a bus"". South Yorkshire to move into tier three from Saturday What tier is my area in? How many cases in my area? Jamie Hawksworth, who owns the Sheffield Tap, said he saw the new restrictions coming. ""I think I speak for most of my staff, and certainly the management team, that it's devastating. We've had the entire business pulled from under us."" He added that the knock-on effect would be fewer orders for local breweries, abattoirs and other suppliers. ""Hospitality only accounts to 3% of the Covid risk at the moment,"" he said. ""We pay the most to the government and receive the least. We're basically being thrown under the bus, we're the scapegoat."" Pub owner Jamie Hawksworth says businesses like his have become ""the scapegoat"" The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said publicans had done everything to make their premises Covid-secure and the news would be ""absolutely devastating"" for pubs and breweries. Chief executive Tom Stainer said: ""If pubs across South Yorkshire are to avoid becoming a sacrificial lamb then they need a decent, long-term financial support package. ""This must properly compensate pubs for having to either close altogether or stay open with extremely low footfall whilst they serve food."" He said help would also be needed after restrictions were lifted to avoid pubs having to ""close their doors for good before Christmas"". The family-run Acorn Brewery in Wombwell, Barnsley, is facing similar worries to other businesses. The microbrewery's managing director Dave Hughes said the business was operating at about 20% of the level it was at before the pandemic. ""The whole hospitality sector seems to have been hit very hard compared to other places,"" he said. The team of 11 at the brewery has been reduced to four. ""Our team has been broken up and it causes a lot of stress and anxiety,"" Mr Hughes said. He said about 95% of his business was supplying pubs, bars and restaurants - like most microbreweries. Microbrewery manager Dave Hughes says the restrictions mean a lot of ""stress and anxiety"" Mr Hughes also runs a real ale pub which would have to close under the new restrictions. ""We can't offer a substantial meal. A lots of pubs that don't have a food offering will suffer and those that do, will they get the footfall? ""I suppose, in a sense, tier three for our pub, at least there is funding that we can now tap into."" He also has concerns about how trade will recover when the restrictions end. ""People find the new norm and go to different outlets and when you do reopen you have to battle to get them back."" Pubs that close under tier three rules will be eligible for financial support Paul McNicholas runs three bars in Barnsley and welcomed the tier three restrictions as it means financial support. He said people were not coming out due to the 22:00 curfew and social mixing restrictions and he had only been opening at the weekend. ""We were finding it difficult to operate under the present restrictions on level two so there was a likelihood we would have closed anyway. ""We were opening the bars and they were running at a loss."" On the new restrictions he said he thought he could cope with the initial 28-day period, but was hopeful they would reopen before Christmas. ""We are reliant a lot on Christmas and I am trying to be optimistic but we feel that we do need that period,"" he said.

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the top level of England Covid restrictions Businesses in Greater Manchester fear some may not survive as the area is moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions. It has followed Liverpool City Region and Lancashire intotier three. Businesses including pubs and bars, unless they serve substantial meals, as well as soft play facilities, betting shops and casinos will have to close on Friday just after midnight. The move has been met with anger, frustration and upset by businesses. Live reaction to the latest Covid measures What is the three-tier system? What Covid tier is my area in? The owner of a Menagerie Restaurant and Bar, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre, said consumer confidence had been knocked by the confusion over coronavirus restrictions. Karina Jadhav said she was allowed to stay open, but have to close anyway as people stay away ""We have been operating under restrictions, which are close to tier three for three months now,"" said Karina Jadhav. ""While we are allowed to stay open, the restrictions, the confusion and the communication coming from the government has really reduced consumer confidence. ""This has resulted - for us - in a lot of cancellations, people not booking, people wanting refunds. ""So while we are allowed to stay open, we are being restricted to the point where it is difficult to keep the business open in the current circumstances."" The managing director of Wythenshawe-based Whitehouse Event Crockery said the situation was ""heartbreaking"". Marc Gough said he had a viable business but had been forgotten by government The business, which supplies goods including plates and glassware for weddings and events, will not be forced to close down in tier three. However, the move to the toughest tier of measures would have a direct effect on the number of bookings, said Marc Gough. ""Weddings cannot take place in a tier three environment, so effectively they are stopping us from working with no financial support,"" he said. ""This is a viable business - a very successful, viable business - and we have just had no support from the government. ""We have been simply forgotten and it's heartbreaking."" Greater Manchester recorded almost 11,000 new cases in the week to 16 October, according to data updated on Monday. Latest figures show cases rose across most of Greater Manchester in the week to 16 October. However, the city of Manchester has so far seen a fall compared with the week before. Even so, it still has a high rate of new cases, with just under 404 per 100,000 people in the week to last Friday. Rochdale recorded Greater Manchester's highest rate with 462 cases per 100,000 residents. Stockport and Trafford have the lowest rates in Greater Manchester, with 266 per 100,000 and 310 per 100,000 respectively. The managing director of a bar in Burnage said it was going to be a ""tough winter"" as the hospitality industry adjusted to the new three-tier system. Elena Rowe, pictured right with her colleague Sean Gregson, said it had been a frustrating time for the business ""It's really sad. We have done everything we can to keep safe,"" said Elena Rowe, from Reasons to be Cheerful. Reasons to be Cheerful will be among the pubs to close under tier three. ""We have regulars and a lot of them drink on their own, and the space we provide is their bubble and it's sad that this is going to end for people. ""It's going to be a tough winter. I'm frustrated and upset,"" said Ms Rowe. The owner of a bar in the heart of Manchester's gay village said tier three would also force him to close. John Hamilton warned that businesses were fading away and he called for help John Hamilton, who runs Bar Pop and employees 60 members of staff, said: ""I am so upset. The city centre will be like a deserted island. ""We need help. We are independent businesses but slowly and surely we are fading away."" He said tier two restrictions were ""bad enough"" and his weekly takings had plummeted from Â£35,000 to Â£11,500 and he was struggling to pay the bills.

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the highest Covid-19 alert level A Â£60m support package for businesses affected by new coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester will be distributed across the region. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the government will be giving the extra funding as the region goes into the highest tier on Friday. The move follows a breakdown in talks with local leaders who requested Â£90m but lowered their demand to Â£65m. Labour Mayor Andy Burnhamtold ITV News,externalhe has ""no regrets for taking a stand"". ""This wasn't a negotiation, this was basically bulldozed through and we took a stand,"" the Greater Manchester mayor said. Starmer attacks 'miserly' Johnson in Covid cash row South Yorkshire to move into tier 3 from Saturday What are Tier 3 rules for Manchester and South Yorkshire? Tier three restrictions 'worst of all worlds' ""So no regrets for taking that stand because the point is they were imposing an arbitrary formula one-by-one on places."" Greater Manchester is the first area to be forced into tier three, England's highest level of alert, against the wishes of local leaders. The Â£65m figure was described by Mr Burnham as the ""bare minimum to prevent a winter of real hardship"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the money offered to regions in the coronavirus crisis During Prime Minister's Question Time, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Mr Johnson for not being able to ""find"" Â£5m, adding ""stop bargaining with people's lives"". ""I think the Prime Minister has crossed a Rubicon here,"" he said. ""Not just with the miserly way he's treated Greater Manchester but in the grubby 'take it or leave' way these local deals are being done - it's corrosive to public trust."" But Mr Johnson said he was ""very proud that this government has already given Greater Manchester Â£1.1bn in support for business, Â£200m in extra un-ringfenced funding, Â£50m to tackle infections in care homes, Â£20m for test and trace, another Â£22m for local response that we announced yesterday"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has since written to the region's council leaders inviting them ""to work with us at pace to design their business support schemes"". He added that this will ""ensure the funding reaches the people and businesses who need it"". The Conservative leader of Bolton Council said he is willing to look at an individual deal over the government's offer of Â£60m. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown David Greenhalgh said: ""It is clear the amount on the table, which is what has been accepted in Liverpool [City Region], Lancashire and now South Yorkshire, and I am not prepared for Bolton businesses to miss out on this extra financial help. ""This is not the time for posturing and politics. This is about getting the best deal available for Bolton business and those who work in the sectors worst affected."" Meanwhile Manchester's night time economy adviser Sacha Lord has started the process to launch a legal challenge of the government's decision to put the region into the top tier. Hetweeted:,external""Last night we started the judicial review into the legality of implementing emergency restrictions on Greater Manchester's hospitality sector, without scientific evidence."" He said a ""pre-action letter has been filed"" and he is waiting for a response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Andy Burnham said he hoped to set a Covid-19 funding template for other areas to use After talks broke down between local leaders and the government, six Tory MPswrote to Mr Burnham,externalaccusing him of putting his ""ego"" above the people of Greater Manchester. Oldham Council leader Sean Fielding said: ""It wasn't just Andy Burnham that rejected the offer of Â£60m, it was collectively the 10 council leaders and Andy Burnham."" ""Â£60m was not enough and it remains not enough,"" added the Labour councillor. The Labour leader of Bury Council Eamonn O'Brien alsoresponded to the letter,,externalsaying: ""This is about our collective fight to get the best possible deal for our businesses and residents, especially those on the lowest pay.""

"Vicky Bourne still has some symptoms in October, having first become ill in March Old age and having a wide range of initial symptoms increase the risk of ""long Covid"", say scientists. The study, seen by the BBC, estimates one in 20 people are sick for least eight weeks. The research at King's College London also showed being female, excess weight and asthma raised the risk. The aim is to develop an early warning signal that can identify patients who need extra care or who might benefit from early treatment. The findings come from an analysis of people entering their symptoms and test results into theCovid Symptom Study app,external. Scientists scoured the data for patterns that could predict who would get long-lasting illness. The results, which are due to be published online, show long Covid can affect anyone, but some things do raise the risk. ""Having more than five different symptoms in the first week was one of the key risk factors,"" Dr Claire Steves, from Kings College London, told BBC News. Covid-19 is more than just a cough - and the virus that causes it can affect organs throughout the body. Somebody who had a cough, fatigue, headache and diarrhoea, and lost their sense of smell -which are all potential symptoms- would be at higher risk than somebody who had a cough alone. The risk also rises with age - particularly over 50 - as did being female. Dr Steves said: ""We've seen from the early data coming out that men were at much more risk of very severe disease and sadly of dying from Covid. It appears that women are more at risk of long Covid."" No previous medical conditions were linked to long Covid except asthma and lung disease. The precise symptoms of long Covid vary from one patient to the next, but fatigue is common. Vicky Bourne, 48, started off with a fever and a ""pathetic little cough"" in March, which became ""absolutely terrifying"" when she struggled to breathe and needed to be given oxygen by a paramedic. She was not admitted to hospital, but is still - in October - living with long Covid. Vicky's health is improving, but her vision has changed and she still gets ""waves"" of more severe illness. Even walking the dog takes so much out of her she can't talk at the same time.

It is not perfect. It correctly identifies 69% of people who go on to develop long-Covid, but also tells around a quarter of people who would recover quickly they would get long Covid too.

'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? 'Long Covid could be four different syndromes' Long Covid: St Annes man 'never recovered' from long-term effects Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Study said: ""It's important that, as well as worrying about excess deaths, we also need to consider those who will be affected by long Covid if we don't get the pandemic under control soon."" Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The findings of the Covid Symptom Study are stark and this should be a sharp reminder to the public, including to young people, that Covid-19 is indiscriminate and can have long-term and potentially devastating effects.""

"Donald Trump, pictured here with President Xi Jinping, has portrayed China as a threat to the US US President Donald Trump has a Chinese bank account and spent years pursuing business projects in the country, the New York Times has reported. The account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management and paid local taxes between 2013 and 2015. It was set up ""to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia"", according to a Trump spokesman. Mr Trump has been critical of US firms doing business in China and sparked a trade war between the two countries. TheNY Times revealed the account,externalafter obtaining Mr Trump's tax records, which included both personal and company financial details. What you need to know about the Trump tax story The newspaper's previous reports show he paid $750 (Â£580) in US federal taxes in 2016 and 2017, when he became president. The Chinese bank account has paid out $188,561 in local taxes. Mr Trump has been critical of presidential candidate rival Joe Biden and his policies towards China in the lead-up to the US election, taking place on 3 November. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? The Trump administration has singled out Mr Biden's son Hunter and made unsubstantiated claims about his dealings with China. Joe Biden's income tax returns and public financial disclosures show no business dealings connected to China. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organisation, described the NY Times story as ""pure speculation"" and said that it made ""incorrect assumptions"". He told the paper that Trump International Hotels Management had ""opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes"". ""No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialised and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,"" Mr Garten said. ""Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose,"" he told the NY Times. The US president has multiple business interests both in the US and overseas. These include golf courses in Scotland and Ireland and a chain of five-star luxury hotels. The NY Times reported that Mr Trump maintains foreign bank accounts in China, Britain and Ireland. In August, Mr Trump said he wanted to offer tax credits to entice US firms to move factories out of China. He also threatened to strip government contracts from firms that continue to outsource work to China. In a speech, Mr Trump vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, saying ""we will end our reliance on China"". This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world In stark contrast, the NY Times report details how Mr Trump has been looking to land business in China. His efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office. Trump dangles cash for US firms moving from China Trump administration plans Chinese tech crackdown Who does China really want to win US election? The tax records it obtained show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over a number of years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018. But the US president's plans in China have been largely driven by Trump International Hotels Management, through direct ownership of THC China Development, according to the NY Times. Analysis by Kerry Allen, BBC China media analyst Donald Trump's tax payments to China have delighted and bemused social media users there, who have been closely following reports scrutinising his tax affairs. Memes and comments referring to ""Comrade Trump"" are lighting up the popular Sina Weibo social network. Users are joking that he has been ""paying his [Communist] party membership"" and ""the motherland will never forget"" his contributions. But many are incredulous he apparently paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax to China, yet very little in the US. ""He has paid China more than 250 times the tax he has paid his own ugly country,"" says one user, noting theNew York Times' recent report alleging Mr Trump paid just $750,external(Â£580) in US taxes in 2016 and 2017. Others are incredulous that theUS president embarked on a trade warwhile seemingly pursuing his own personal Chinese interests. No further details, however, have emerged in Chinese media reports on the bank account unearthed by the New York Times. With two weeks to go until the election, Mr Biden again remained off the trail on Tuesday as he prepared for the final presidential debate on Thursday. The Democrat is maintaining a steady lead in national opinion polls. Mr Trump, making his own pitch to the American people, again insisted the US was weathering the pandemic well - despite figures showing rising cases and hospitalisations in almost all states. First Lady Melania Trump pulled out of a planned campaign appearance - a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the president - because of lingering symptoms of her Covid-19 infection. On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Mr Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

"Prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said the two students had described Samuel Paty to the killer Two students were paid to identify a teacher to the man who beheaded him last Friday in an attack that shocked France, prosecutors have alleged. Samuel Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty. The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference. He said Anzorov had told them he wanted ""to humiliate him, to hit him"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack. The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign that was orchestrated against Mr Paty. The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack. Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had faced threats for showing the cartoons He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons. The prosecutor's revelations come ahead of a national memorial service in Paris for Mr Paty. President Emmanuel Macron will attend the event at the Sorbonne University on Wednesday evening, along with the teacher's family and some 400 guests. He is expected to posthumously give Mr Paty France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur, Earlier, the president held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged co-operation in fighting terrorism. Mr Putin described the attack as a ""barbarous murder"". Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008. Mr Macron said he wanted to see a ""strengthening of Franco-Russian co-operation in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration"", the French presidency said. Russia has played down any association with the attacker. ""This person had lived in France for the past 12 years,"" a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris told the Tass news agency on Saturday. Police have raided some 40 homes following the attack, and the government also ordered a mosque to close for six months. The Pantin mosque, just north of Paris, was closed after it emerged it had shared videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty. In one clip, posted just days before the attack, it also shared his school's address. This video can not be played French minister: Lessons on freedom of expression will continue The mosque later expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing. Meanwhile, mosques in the south-western cities of Bordeaux and Beziers were put under police protection after they reported threats. ""Such actions are unacceptable on the soil of the Republic,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said in a tweet on Wednesday. On Tuesday, President Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing. He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community from the influence of radicalism. Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October. The history and geography teacher advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Charlie Hebdo republishes Muhammad cartoons Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Watch: Violence and hostility inside the French police Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslimsbecause Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication. This video can not be played Rallies in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty France's Muslim community, which is Europe's largest, comprises about 10% of the population. Some French Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.

"The 2.8m people in Greater Manchester are the first to be forced into higher restrictions against local leaders' objections A Â£60m offer to help Greater Manchester deal with the toughest Covid restrictions ""remains on the table"", the health secretary has told MPs. The area will get Â£22m to help enforce the ""tier three"" rules - the tightest restrictions - which start on Friday. Matt Hancock said the ""door is open"" for more talks on a Â£60m package to support businesses and employees - but local leaders want at least Â£65m. Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said people faced ""a winter of real hardship"". 'Heartbreak' over region's tier 3 status Kuenssberg: Greater Manchester deal falls over a Â£5m gap The 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester are the first to be forced into tier three, England's highest level of alert, against the wishes of local leaders. Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are the only other areas currently under the tightest restrictions. Under tier three, pubs and bars which do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown. Mr Hancock told the Commons ""the deal on the table that the mayor of Greater Manchester walked away from"" - which was Â£60m - was ""a fair deal"". But on Tuesday Mr Burnham claimed the offer was too low, saying: ""I don't think it is right to ask people to go into a lockdown... without supporting them through all of that."" Six Tory MPs havewritten to Mr Burnham,externalaccusing him of putting his ""ego"" above the people of Greater Manchester, suggesting the mayor should not be involved in future talks with government. Meanwhile, negotiations will continue on Wednesday over whether South Yorkshire will be next to move into the tier three restrictions. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning, they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham themselves discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree - Mr Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more proportionately than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. A Greater Manchester source said: ""We had costed what people needed. Rather than give us what people needed, they were only willing to give us what they would offer."" But government sources have suggested Mr Burnham was intransigent, with one saying: ""Other local leaders in GM were more reasonable and constructive, but Burnham was too proud to make a deal."" So after 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over a gap of Â£5m - a figure not disputed by either side. Read the full analysis here After 10 days of talks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with ""regret"" he would impose the tier three restrictions on Greater Manchester without local leaders' agreement. As well as shutting many pubs and bars, the restrictions mean betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. What Covid tier is my area in? What will the Tier 3 rules for Greater Manchester be? The prime minister said the region would receive Â£22m as part of a ""comprehensive package of support"" for enforcement measures and the local test and trace work. On Tuesday evening, Mr Hancock told MPs that a separate sum of Â£60m was ""proportionate"" to what the other areas in tier three had been given, and that it was still available. Local politicians in Greater Manchester originally submitted a request for Â£90m but lowered their demand to Â£65m - a figure described by Mr Burnham as the ""bare minimum"". Mr Burnham accused the government of ""playing poker"" with people's lives through the negotiations. And Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused the government of ""punishing the people of Greater Manchester"". ""This is a national crisis and we won't defeat this virus on the cheap,"" he added. This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' Meanwhile, Chris Green, the Conservative MP for Bolton West, said his constituency in Greater Manchester had been in local, tougher measures than tier three and claimed they ""didn't work"". ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft play centres will make a dramatic difference,"" he said. ""It hasn't and it won't."" Separately, six Conservative MPs in the region wrote to Mr Burnham, accusing him of an ""inability to work constructively"" with the government after he was offered ""92% of what you asked for"". They called for him to stand aside to allow other local leaders to reach a settlement reflecting the ""extremely urgent and precarious position we now find ourselves in."" Talks are set to continue on Wednesday about whether South Yorkshire will be next to enter tier three, also known as the ""very high"" alert level. Other areas in tier two but known to be in discussions about tighter restrictions are West Yorkshire, the North East, Teesside and Nottinghamshire. However, David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that no ""serious conversations"" have been scheduled with ministers or senior civil servants. ""We will obviously engage with conversations about tier three and the economic deal that comes with that as and when the government comes to us,"" he said. He added that the council did not receive a letter it had been expecting outlining more details on Tuesday night and that any deal must be ""just as good as other areas have received"". When the restrictions come into force in Greater Manchester, about 5.8 million people in England will be living under the highest level of coronavirus alert. That includes 1.5 million people in the Liverpool City Region and 1.5 million people in Lancashire. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highest daily death toll since 5 June, with 241 more people dying within 28 days of a positive test for the virus. Another 21,331 confirmed cases were reported, the first time cases have exceeded 20,000 since mass testing began - with the exception of 4 October, which included thousands of cases from previous days which had been missed due to a spreadsheet error. The health secretary said the virus ""remains a perilous threat"" with cases among the over-60s continuing to rise. He said the average daily hospital admissions in Greater Manchester are now higher than they were in 26 March, just after the UK went into a national lockdown. But Mr Hancock said in the north-east of England there were ""early signs"" cases were ""starting to flatten"", although the fall in infections was so far happening among young people who were least at risk.

"Royal Mail will start collecting parcels and mail from people's homes from Wednesday as it tries to grab a bigger share of the parcel market. The firm is trying to capitalise on a rise in online shopping which has been accelerated by the coronavirus crisis. Royal Mail has seen parcel deliveries increase in recent years but is still on track to make a loss in 2020. The move to collecting could be beneficial if the company can work out logistical issues, an analyst said. Royal Mail, which already delivers parcels, is joining an already crowded parcel-collection market where it faces rivals such as DPD, Hermes and DHL. Its Parcel Collect service, which has been trialled in parts of the west of England, will be available every day except Sunday, and there will be 72p charge per parcel, plus postage costs. Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Royal Mail set for 'material loss' despite jump in parcels Pre-paid return packages can be collected for 60p per item. People running their own business from home will be able to use the service, along with consumers, a Royal Mail spokesperson said. The firm said it was ""one of the biggest changes to the daily delivery since the launch of the post box in 1852"". By Ramzan Karmali Royal Mail says it has found a solution for its customers who have parcels to send but can't face the queues in their local post office. The firm's new ""Parcel Collect""  service will operate six days a week and you'll be able to send up to five parcels at a time. Your local postman or postwoman will either collect your parcels from your front door or a designated safe space and the service will be part of their daily round. To use the service you have to book online (www.royalmail.com/bookcollection or via their app) - this can be done from five days in advance up to midnight the day before collection. Customers will have to make sure their postage is paid for, print their own labels and then pay for the service online. The charge for using the service is 72p per parcel, in addition to postage costs. Parcel Collect is also available for pre-paid return items at a cost of 60p per item. The firm is under pressure to find new revenue lines after seeing the number of letters it delivers halve over the last 16 years due to the popularity of email. During that time its parcel deliveries have increased greatly, and it now hopes to tap into the booming returns market, as online shoppers seek to change items bought online. The company had already made moves to enter the parcel market, launching parcel post boxes last year. However, historically Royal Mail has underinvested in its parcel services, and only launched automated parcel sorting in 2017, according to Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett. Mr Hyett said the new service would see a ""massive increase"" in its capacity, which would require a ""significant amount of investment"" and a ""high degree of planning and organisation"" which had sometimes been lacking. However, he said that if Royal Mail managed to get it right, it could help mitigate losses it incurs through its obligation to provide a ""universal service"" across the UK. For example, currently it must deliver to more isolated places in the UK which drags on its profits. But being able to collect from those locations could help it maximise its returns, Mr Hyett said.

"Donald Trump, pictured here with President Xi Jinping, has portrayed China as a threat to the US US President Donald Trump has a Chinese bank account and spent years pursuing business projects in the country, the New York Times has reported. The account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management and paid local taxes between 2013 and 2015. It was set up ""to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia"", according to a Trump spokesman. Mr Trump has been critical of US firms doing business in China and sparked a trade war between the two countries. TheNY Times revealed the account,externalafter obtaining Mr Trump's tax records, which included both personal and company financial details. What you need to know about the Trump tax story The newspaper's previous reports show he paid $750 (Â£580) in US federal taxes in 2016 and 2017, when he became president. The Chinese bank account has paid out $188,561 in local taxes. Mr Trump has been critical of presidential candidate rival Joe Biden and his policies towards China in the lead-up to the US election, taking place on 3 November. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? The Trump administration has singled out Mr Biden's son Hunter and made unsubstantiated claims about his dealings with China. Joe Biden's income tax returns and public financial disclosures show no business dealings connected to China. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organisation, described the NY Times story as ""pure speculation"" and said that it made ""incorrect assumptions"". He told the paper that Trump International Hotels Management had ""opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes"". ""No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialised and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,"" Mr Garten said. ""Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose,"" he told the NY Times. The US president has multiple business interests both in the US and overseas. These include golf courses in Scotland and Ireland and a chain of five-star luxury hotels. The NY Times reported that Mr Trump maintains foreign bank accounts in China, Britain and Ireland. In August, Mr Trump said he wanted to offer tax credits to entice US firms to move factories out of China. He also threatened to strip government contracts from firms that continue to outsource work to China. In a speech, Mr Trump vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, saying ""we will end our reliance on China"". This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world In stark contrast, the NY Times report details how Mr Trump has been looking to land business in China. His efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office. Trump dangles cash for US firms moving from China Trump administration plans Chinese tech crackdown Who does China really want to win US election? The tax records it obtained show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over a number of years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018. But the US president's plans in China have been largely driven by Trump International Hotels Management, through direct ownership of THC China Development, according to the NY Times. Analysis by Kerry Allen, BBC China media analyst Donald Trump's tax payments to China have delighted and bemused social media users there, who have been closely following reports scrutinising his tax affairs. Memes and comments referring to ""Comrade Trump"" are lighting up the popular Sina Weibo social network. Users are joking that he has been ""paying his [Communist] party membership"" and ""the motherland will never forget"" his contributions. But many are incredulous he apparently paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax to China, yet very little in the US. ""He has paid China more than 250 times the tax he has paid his own ugly country,"" says one user, noting theNew York Times' recent report alleging Mr Trump paid just $750,external(Â£580) in US taxes in 2016 and 2017. Others are incredulous that theUS president embarked on a trade warwhile seemingly pursuing his own personal Chinese interests. No further details, however, have emerged in Chinese media reports on the bank account unearthed by the New York Times. With two weeks to go until the election, Mr Biden again remained off the trail on Tuesday as he prepared for the final presidential debate on Thursday. The Democrat is maintaining a steady lead in national opinion polls. Mr Trump, making his own pitch to the American people, again insisted the US was weathering the pandemic well - despite figures showing rising cases and hospitalisations in almost all states. First Lady Melania Trump pulled out of a planned campaign appearance - a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the president - because of lingering symptoms of her Covid-19 infection. On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Mr Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

"The 2.8m people in Greater Manchester are the first to be forced into higher restrictions against local leaders' objections A Â£60m offer to help Greater Manchester deal with the toughest Covid restrictions ""remains on the table"", the health secretary has told MPs. The area will get Â£22m to help enforce the ""tier three"" rules - the tightest restrictions - which start on Friday. Matt Hancock said the ""door is open"" for more talks on a Â£60m package to support businesses and employees - but local leaders want at least Â£65m. Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said people faced ""a winter of real hardship"". 'Heartbreak' over region's tier 3 status Kuenssberg: Greater Manchester deal falls over a Â£5m gap The 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester are the first to be forced into tier three, England's highest level of alert, against the wishes of local leaders. Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are the only other areas currently under the tightest restrictions. Under tier three, pubs and bars which do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown. Mr Hancock told the Commons ""the deal on the table that the mayor of Greater Manchester walked away from"" - which was Â£60m - was ""a fair deal"". But on Tuesday Mr Burnham claimed the offer was too low, saying: ""I don't think it is right to ask people to go into a lockdown... without supporting them through all of that."" Six Tory MPs havewritten to Mr Burnham,externalaccusing him of putting his ""ego"" above the people of Greater Manchester, suggesting the mayor should not be involved in future talks with government. Meanwhile, negotiations will continue on Wednesday over whether South Yorkshire will be next to move into the tier three restrictions. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning, they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham themselves discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree - Mr Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more proportionately than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. A Greater Manchester source said: ""We had costed what people needed. Rather than give us what people needed, they were only willing to give us what they would offer."" But government sources have suggested Mr Burnham was intransigent, with one saying: ""Other local leaders in GM were more reasonable and constructive, but Burnham was too proud to make a deal."" So after 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over a gap of Â£5m - a figure not disputed by either side. Read the full analysis here After 10 days of talks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with ""regret"" he would impose the tier three restrictions on Greater Manchester without local leaders' agreement. As well as shutting many pubs and bars, the restrictions mean betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. What Covid tier is my area in? What will the Tier 3 rules for Greater Manchester be? The prime minister said the region would receive Â£22m as part of a ""comprehensive package of support"" for enforcement measures and the local test and trace work. On Tuesday evening, Mr Hancock told MPs that a separate sum of Â£60m was ""proportionate"" to what the other areas in tier three had been given, and that it was still available. Local politicians in Greater Manchester originally submitted a request for Â£90m but lowered their demand to Â£65m - a figure described by Mr Burnham as the ""bare minimum"". Mr Burnham accused the government of ""playing poker"" with people's lives through the negotiations. And Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused the government of ""punishing the people of Greater Manchester"". ""This is a national crisis and we won't defeat this virus on the cheap,"" he added. This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' Meanwhile, Chris Green, the Conservative MP for Bolton West, said his constituency in Greater Manchester had been in local, tougher measures than tier three and claimed they ""didn't work"". ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft play centres will make a dramatic difference,"" he said. ""It hasn't and it won't."" Separately, six Conservative MPs in the region wrote to Mr Burnham, accusing him of an ""inability to work constructively"" with the government after he was offered ""92% of what you asked for"". They called for him to stand aside to allow other local leaders to reach a settlement reflecting the ""extremely urgent and precarious position we now find ourselves in."" Talks are set to continue on Wednesday about whether South Yorkshire will be next to enter tier three, also known as the ""very high"" alert level. Other areas in tier two but known to be in discussions about tighter restrictions are West Yorkshire, the North East, Teesside and Nottinghamshire. However, David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that no ""serious conversations"" have been scheduled with ministers or senior civil servants. ""We will obviously engage with conversations about tier three and the economic deal that comes with that as and when the government comes to us,"" he said. He added that the council did not receive a letter it had been expecting outlining more details on Tuesday night and that any deal must be ""just as good as other areas have received"". When the restrictions come into force in Greater Manchester, about 5.8 million people in England will be living under the highest level of coronavirus alert. That includes 1.5 million people in the Liverpool City Region and 1.5 million people in Lancashire. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highest daily death toll since 5 June, with 241 more people dying within 28 days of a positive test for the virus. Another 21,331 confirmed cases were reported, the first time cases have exceeded 20,000 since mass testing began - with the exception of 4 October, which included thousands of cases from previous days which had been missed due to a spreadsheet error. The health secretary said the virus ""remains a perilous threat"" with cases among the over-60s continuing to rise. He said the average daily hospital admissions in Greater Manchester are now higher than they were in 26 March, just after the UK went into a national lockdown. But Mr Hancock said in the north-east of England there were ""early signs"" cases were ""starting to flatten"", although the fall in infections was so far happening among young people who were least at risk.

"This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced South Yorkshire will move into tier three from 00.01 on Saturday, meaning 7.3 million people in England will be living under the toughest Covid rules. Sheffield City region mayor Dan Jarvis said the move followed ""extensive discussions"" with ministers. The rules will apply to all council areas in South Yorkshire - Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Greater Manchester will be placed in the same tieron Friday, against local leaders' wishes. Under tier three - England's ""very high"" level of alert which is already in place in Lancashire and Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. Additional rules in South Yorkshire include the closure of betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos, soft play centres and gym classes - though gyms will remain open. Meanwhile,Coventry is to move to tier two from midnight on Friday,the city council has said, which will prevent households from mixing in homes and hospitality venues. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to make an announcement relating to support for workers and businesses affected by tier two restrictions in the House of Commons on Thursday. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said the government is understood to have acknowledged the reality that there are three tiers of pandemic shutdowns but only two tiers of support, with some firms suffering a collapse in business without being able to benefit fromthe Job Support Scheme. Starmer attacks 'miserly' Johnson in Covid cash row Hospitality sector 'thrown under a bus' 'Tier 3 will be short, sharp shock that's needed' It comes as a further 26,688 new coronavirus cases were recorded onWednesday,external, while another 191 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. It is the highest ever number of recorded daily cases. However, mass testing was not available during the peak of the pandemic, when daily cases wereestimated to have reached as many as 100,000. Health minister Edward Argar told MPs there have been more than 12,000 cases in South Yorkshire so far in October - more than in July, August and September combined - while the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has reached more than half that seen at the height of the pandemic. He said he was aware the measures would ""entail further sacrifice"", but ""bearing down hard"" would help to slow the spread of coronavirus. Doncaster's infection rate was 316 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 17 October, compared to 370 in Rotherham, 395 in Sheffield and 415 in Barnsley. Local leaders in South Yorkshire have agreed to a financial package of Â£41m, which includes Â£30m to support the region's businesses and Â£11m for local authorities to support public health measures like contact tracing. Mr Jarvis said it was the ""responsible route"" and that ""inaction was not an option"" after its hospital admissions doubled in 10 days. He insisted he had ""moved heaven and earth to secure the maximum amount"" of support for the region, which he said would help to reduce the re-infection rate and pressure on the NHS, while supporting the local economy. It comes a day after new restrictions were imposed on Greater Manchester after talks with local leaders, who had called for at least Â£65m, broke down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Â£60m offered to Greater Manchester to support businesses and workers affected by the new restrictionswould be distributed to the region's boroughs. We all knew it was coming. But I was still surprised when the announcement leapt into my inbox at 09:02 BST this morning. Over a million people in South Yorkshire are to go into tier three on Saturday. The phone started ringing and it hasn't stopped yet. Agreed - or imposed? It depends who you talk to. It has been signed off by South Yorkshire but it doesn't mean all the leaders are happy about how it happened. Chris Read, the Rotherham Council leader, is angrier than I've ever seen him. He says it wasn't a negotiation at all - just the government telling South Yorkshire what it was prepared to offer. His point is if that was the case, why not do it a week earlier? Miriam Cates, the Conservative Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, says it's a fair deal and heaped praise on Labour mayor Dan Jarvis. We're all digesting how it will affect us day to day. People will be working out how to run their businesses, provide childcare and take care of their mental health. A review is coming in 28 days but there is no magic number for when an area comes out of tier three. People in South Yorkshire are being asked to bear the toughest restrictions, without knowing when they'll end. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown. Any areas in tier three will have its status reviewed after 28 days, the prime minister said. What Covid tier is my area in? How many cases are in my area? The simplest way for areas to get out of those restrictions was to get the reproduction number, the rate at which the virus is spreading, down to one or below, Boris Johnson told MPs. Rates of admission to hospital and other data would also be taken into account, he added. Mr Jarvis said it would be ""very challenging"" for his region to come out of tier three in 28 days ""given the pressures of winter"", but urged people to renew their efforts to ensure all local authorities had a ""fighting chance"" of coming out by then. Other areas in tier two but known to be in discussions about tighter restrictions are West Yorkshire, the North East, Teesside and Nottinghamshire. Talks between council leaders and No 10 about moving the North East into tier threehave been ""paused""following a fall in the region's infection rate over the past week. David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, saidno ""serious conversations"" have been scheduled with ministers or senior civil servants, but he would expect any economic deal to be as good as other areas have received. Jamie Hawksworth, who owns the Sheffield Tap, said he saw the new restrictions coming - but that won't lessen the impact. ""I think I speak for most of my staff, and certainly the management team, that it's devastating. We've had the entire business pulled from under us."" He added that the knock-on effect would be fewer orders for local breweries, abattoirs and other suppliers. Read more from local business owners here 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? 'Long Covid could be four different syndromes' St Annes man 'never recovered' from long-term Covid effects Meanwhile, Prof John Edmunds, a scientist advising the government, warned there was ""very little chance"" that Covid-19 would be eradicated. He told two MPs' committees that people would have to learn to live with the virus ""forever more"" but it was an ""almost certainty"" that a vaccine could be ready in the ""not-too-distant future"", possibly towards the end of winter.

Talks are set to continue on Wednesday about whether South Yorkshire will be next to enter tier three, also known as the ""very high"" alert level. Other areas in tier two but known to be in discussions about tighter restrictions are West Yorkshire, the North East, Teesside and Nottinghamshire. However, David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that no ""serious conversations"" have been scheduled with ministers or senior civil servants. ""We will obviously engage with conversations about tier three and the economic deal that comes with that as and when the government comes to us,"" he said. He added that the council did not receive a letter it had been expecting outlining more details on Tuesday night and that any deal must be ""just as good as other areas have received"". When the restrictions come into force in Greater Manchester, about 5.8 million people in England will be living under the highest level of coronavirus alert. That includes 1.5 million people in the Liverpool City Region and 1.5 million people in Lancashire. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highest daily death toll since 5 June, with 241 more people dying within 28 days of a positive test for the virus. Another 21,331 confirmed cases were reported, the first time cases have exceeded 20,000 since mass testing began - with the exception of 4 October, which included thousands of cases from previous days which had been missed due to a spreadsheet error. The health secretary said the virus ""remains a perilous threat"" with cases among the over-60s continuing to rise. He said the average daily hospital admissions in Greater Manchester are now higher than they were in 26 March, just after the UK went into a national lockdown. But Mr Hancock said in the north-east of England there were ""early signs"" cases were ""starting to flatten"", although the fall in infections was so far happening among young people who were least at risk.

"UK government borrowing hit Â£36.1bn in September as the UK continued its heavy spending to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

"Boris Johnson's allies blamed Andy Burnham's ""pride"" for the failure to reach a deal After Monday's will-they-won't-they and political tit-for-tat, the back-and-forth between the Westminster government and the leaders of Greater Manchester is at an end. But it's a messy one, and a politically risky one for them both. And, given what could be at stake, a situation that already looks like a political failure. Tuesday started with more conversations between the two sides - actually, this time, starting to talk in detail about the money. No agreement from latest Manchester Covid talks 'Tier one ends at my garden wall' What Covid tier is my area in? Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m from central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits, the BBC understands. But in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning, they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. Andy Burnham's team accused the PM of ""trying to grind us into submission"" It's understood Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham themselves discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more proportionately than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. A Greater Manchester source said: ""We had costed what people needed. Rather than give us what people needed, they were only willing to give us what they would offer."" But government sources have suggested Mr Burnham was intransigent, with one saying: ""Other local leaders in GM were more reasonable and constructive, but Burnham was too proud to make a deal."" In response, a Greater Manchester source said there had been ""unanimity"" and accused the government of ""trying to grind us into submission"". It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. So after 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over a gap of Â£5m - a figure not disputed by either side.

Do join us again tomorrow. As our coverage heads to a close, here are some of the headlines from across the UK and the rest of the world today: Spain has surpassed one million coronavirus cases, its health ministry says. It means it is the first country in western Europe to have more than a million total cases, at 1,005,295. The country's death toll rose to 34,366 on Wednesday. Tunisia only has 181 intensive care unit beds Tunisiaâs health minister has warned that intensive care
units in the countryâs public hospitals are about 80% full. Fouzi Mehdi told reporters that the country only has 181
intensive care unit beds â 145 are now being used. Tunisia is seeing a rise in the number of cases and
has now reported a total of 45,000 infections and 740 deaths since the
pandemic began. Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn has tested positive for coronavirus and is quarantining at home, the government says. Infection rates in the country have been rising in recent weeks, and they hit a daily record of
7,830 new cases on Saturday. Microbrewery manager Dave Hughes says the restrictions mean a lot of ""stress"" Business owners in South Yorkshire have expressed concerns about their survivalas news came today that they will face tighter coronavirus restrictions. Jamie Hawksworth, who owns the Sheffield Tap, says he saw the new restrictions coming and they will be ""devastating"" for his staff. ""We've had the entire business pulled from under us,"" he says. ""We're basically being thrown under the bus, we're the scapegoat."" The family-run Acorn Brewery in Wombwell, Barnsley, is facing similar worries. The microbrewery's managing director Dave Hughes says the business was operating at about 20% of the level it was at before the pandemic and its team has been cut from 11 to four. Mr Hughes also runs a real ale pub which will have to close under the new restrictions. ""We can't offer a substantial meal. A lots of pubs that don't have a food offering will suffer and those that do - well will they get the footfall?"" Lockdown had a major impact on the UK's mental health, including increased rates of suicidal thoughts, according to new research. The study, led by the University of Glasgow, examined the effects of Covid-19 during the height of the pandemic. Its findings suggested certain groups were particularly at risk, including young people and women. This publication is the most detailed examination of how the UK's adult population coped during the first weeks of lockdown, when people were given strict orders to stay at home. Researchers say public health measures, like lockdowns, are necessary to protect the general population, but warn they may have a ""profound and long-lasting"" effect on mental health and will extend beyond those who have been affected by the virus. The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at three blocks of time between March 31 and May 11. Just over 3,000 adults in the UK were surveyed and a range of mental health factors were considered, including depression, loneliness, suicide attempts and self-harm. The Department of Health in England said it was increasing investment in mental health services. If you need support on mental health, there is more informationhere.

Thursday after reporting a record 10,040 new cases in a single day. The infection rate has doubled in less than three weeks. On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament held an
emergency session to discuss a bill to help the countryâs health system,
Reuters news agency reports. Government spokesman Piotr Muller said the government
will decide whether to move the teaching of older pupils in primary schools
online. It comes as the governmentâs Covid-19 adviser Andrzej
Horban told local radio that the health system can only cope with a maximum of
10,000 new cases a day. With further restrictions in place across large areas of the UK, the government is spending more and more on measures to support local economies. But how much is this likely to cost the UK? Well, we won't really know how big the final bill will be until after the crisis is over. But the government will certainly have to borrow enormous amounts of money. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR),external, which keeps tabs on public spending, the government will have to borrow Â£372bn for the current financial year, (April 2020 to April 2021). And that's before the cost of new lockdowns and support measures announced in the autumn are considered. To put it into context: before the crisis, the government was expecting to borrow about Â£55bn for the whole financial year, but it has already borrowedÂ£208.5bn so far this year. Up to 7 August, the total cost of measures announced to combat Covid-19 was Â£210bn,according to the National Audit Office,external. For more on the sums,read on here. The UK government has announced there have been a further 26,688 daily coronavirus cases. Another 191 people died within 28 days of positive test, it said, taking the UK's total to 44,158. BBC Radio 5 Live Pub landlord Paul Foster From Saturday, South Yorkshire will follow Liverpool, Lancashire and Greater Manchester into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Paul Foster is the landlord of two pubs in Sheffield, the Norfolk Arms and the Red Lion. He told BBC Radio 5 Live his pubs would be staying open. âPurely because the bit of research we have done into the support package is that itâs negligent; it doesnât cover anything. So weâll stay open and do our best to serve our community,"" he said. âOctoberâs always a difficult month to trade in anyway, as people need a reason to come out, and at the moment theyâve got a reason to stay away, so itâs been a challenging month. ""We always try to work on the front foot, so weâve sustained trade at the moment. If there are quite a lot of pubs shutting down, do we increase our market by staying open?â âAs a publican, I donât understand what the negotiations are about. If weâre having to close places down because of health, close places down because of health.""  Labourâs deputy leader Angela Rayner has been rebuked by the deputy Speaker after the word âscumâ was heard in the Commons. Dame Eleanor Laing intervened after Tory MP Chris Clarkson asked if Ms Rayner had used the word about him as âthat is what I heardâ. Ms Rayner complained that the Tory MP said something inaccurate in his speech in a debate on support for areas under extra Covid restrictions. This video can not be played Clarkson, Rayner and Laing on 'scum' comment in Commons A member of the UK government's scientific advisory group has told MPs that people will have to learn to live with the virus ""forever more"". Epidemiologist Prof John Edmunds said it was an ""almost certainty"" that a vaccine will help to manage the epidemic in the ""not-too-distant future"". But he also said: ""There is very little chance that it's going to become eradicated."" He also warned the second Covid-19 wave would lead to tens of thousands of deaths. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told a select committee things were ""getting to the point where the health service will be under strain in much of the North in the next few weeks"". He said: ""There's no way we come out of this wave now without counting our deaths in the tens of thousandsâ The royal family came under criticism for going on holiday during a partial lockdown The Dutch royal family say they regret
going on holiday during a partial lockdown in the Netherlands. King Willem-Alexander went on
holiday to Greece on Saturday along with his wife and children. They returned a
day later following a public outcry. Speaking in a video, the King said: âOur
journey to Greece has provoked strong reactions from many Dutch people. It
hurts to have betrayed your trust in us.â Last week The Netherlands entered a
partial lockdown. All bars and restaurants are closed for four weeks. The government urged people to limit international travel. ""Even though the journey was in
line with the regulations, it was very unwise not to take into account the
impact of the new restrictions on our community,"" the King said. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has come
under fire for allowing the family to go. He admitted on Sunday that a âwrong
assessmentâ was made by not stopping them from going on holiday. We've been hearing today about the stricter coronavirus measures coming into place for South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. But the effects will take two or three weeks to show if top-tier coronavirus restrictions are working in a region, MPs have heard. Dr Clare Gardiner, director general of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) told two select committees that it would take that long for the data to come through, with part of the lag due to the virus having a 10-day incubation period. She added: ""We also are looking really keenly at the number of people being admitted to hospital. ""We are particularly concerned and will be looking closely at case rates in the over-60s and watching quite carefully the information about outbreaks in care homes, so looking to protect and being able to protect the vulnerable."" When asked about the criteria used to raise an area from tier two to tier three, Dr Gardiner said there were a ""basket of indicators"" which were looked at with the chief medical officer who would then make recommendations to ministers. These included having a rate of more than 100-150 cases a week per 100,000 people, case rates among the over-60s, a positivity rate in tests of more than 7.5% and the number of people being admitted to hospital. The prime minister has ""crossed the Rubicon"" with the ""miserly"" way he has treated Greater Manchester, Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions. After the Labour leader called for an end to the âendless local battlesâ over imposing tough restrictions, Boris Johnson said he was proud of the ""one-nation support"" the government has given throughout the virus pandemic. And the prime minister also accused him of wanting to âturn the lights out with a full national lockdownâ. This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on Manchester Covid payments Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed that employees of closed businesses in tier three areas will get 80% of their income. This is important because the furlough scheme, which closes at the end of October, made sure such workers received 80% of their wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500. But theJob Support Scheme, which will replace it in November, will provide 67% of normal salary up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month. It is certainly the case that some workers on low incomes will get at least 80% of their usual wages. In particular, people whose wages were low enough for them to qualify for Universal Credit before their employers were forced to close, are likely to get at least 80% of their wages. But it is also the case that some workers will get less than 80%. The point is that the prime minister failed to mention those who do not get UC at all, or only get a bit of it, who would receive less than 80% of their usual income.

They were in the Wouldhave in South Shields, South Tyneside, when staff members challenged them after seeing their football kit under their jackets, said pub chain JD Wetherspoon. Northumbria Police said the member of staff reported a breach of the coronavirus regulations, and officers arrived at the pub. The group was fined Â£200 each, which will be halved if it is paid within a fortnight. Ch Supt Janice Hutton of Northumbria Police, said: ""This group showed a flagrant disregard for the rules which are in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus."" The Wetherspoon spokesman said the group had been asked if they were from the same household and that they had said yes. But player Josh Robertson, one of the those who was fined, denied that version of events. He told the PA news agency: ""They didn't ask if we lived in the same house. Why would 12 lads say we lived in the same house?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasclaimed that Transport for London (TfL) was ""effectively bankrupted""before the coronavirus pandemic after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan accused the government of ""draconian"" demands in exchange for a bailout. The prime minister said any increase in fares was ""entirely the responsibility"" of Khan who he said had ""left a massive black hole in its finances"". But Khan called Johnson a ""liar"" and said he had successfully reduced the deficit, which he said was accrued by the prime minister when he was mayor in 2016, by 71%. ""Covid-19 is the sole cause of TfL's challenges. The PM wants to increase fares, the C-Charge and taxes and end free travel for children and older Londoners,"" hetweeted.,external The mayor said government proposals for a second bail-out of TfL include higher council taxes, an expanded congestion charge zone and a hike in Tube and bus fares. The Department for Transport said talks over a settlement were continuing. TfL bosses have asked for a Â£5.7bn package to prop up services for the next 18 months, after passenger numbers and revenues plummeted in the aftermath the March lockdown. In May, the government granted TfL Â£1.6bn in emergency funding to keep services running. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The end of cheaper restaurant meals pushed UK prices up last month after the Eat Out to Help Out scheme expired. The UK's inflation rate, which tracks the prices of goods and services, climbed to 0.5% in September, from 0.2% in August. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) began rising more quickly in September after the discount meals scheme ended, pushing up restaurant and cafÃ© prices, Transport costs also went up as demand for second-hand cars increased. In catering services, prices rose 4.1% between August and September 2020, compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same two months in 2019. Transport costs rose for the first time since March, partly because the price of second-hand cars was boosted by increased demand as people, reportedly, looked to reduce their reliance on public transport, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The price of second-hand cars, climbed 2.1% between August and September 2020, compared with a 1.4% fall between the same two months a year ago. Average petrol prices also rose to 113.3p per litre in September 2020, up from 113.1 pence in August. However, that was still some way below the 127.3p recorded in September 2019. The drop in the cost of air fares usually seen in the September inflation index had much less effect this year, according to Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""Air fares would normally fall substantially at this time due to the end of the school holidays, but with prices subdued this year, as fewer people have been travelling abroad, the price drop has been less significant,"" he said. UK job losses 'could be larger than forecast' UK facing 'unprecedented economic uncertainty' Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that in the light of continued low inflation, the Bank of England was likely to increase its monetary stimulus measures next month to boost the ailing economy. ""With CPI inflation just 0.5% in September, it's hard to think of reasons why the Bank of England won't launch another Â£100bn or so of QE at the November meeting. Anddespite public borrowing still jumping, the government may yet spend more,"" he said. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. September's CPI is used in the calculation for state pensions, but the government's triple-lock rule means the increase will be 2.5%, as it's the highest figure out of CPI, earnings growth for the year to July (which was actually negative), or 2.5%. State benefits are also decided by the September inflation figure, meaning payments will rise 0.5% next April, which is far less than this year's 1.7% increase. The September figure is also used to decide the annual increase in business rates. ""Today's headline rate of inflation of 0.5% signals that gross business rates bills next year for 2021-22 will increase by Â£159.42m in England,"" said real estate adviser Altus Group. Business rates are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK state pension is expected to rise by 2.5% in April, owing to calculations guiding the government's triple-lock promise. With average earnings lower than a year earlier (based on official figures for May to July), and now the inflation rate only having risen slightly, the backstop of a 2.5% increase kicks in. This follows three years of higher rises and is well down on the 3.9% increase seen in April this year. Although it is still to be officially confirmed, it should mean: The new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) should go up by Â£4.40 a week from Â£175.20 a week at present to Â£179.60Â a week in April The old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) should go up by Â£3.35 a week from Â£134.25 a week now to Â£137.60 a week in April The expected increase could reignite debate over fairness between the generations. On one hand, the rise will seem high to those who have lost jobs during the pandemic, but the UK state pension remains one of the least generous in western economies. The age at which people now start to receive the UK state pension recently hit 66 for men and women. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said the two students had described Samuel Paty to the killer Two students were paid to identify a teacher to the man who beheaded him last Friday in an attack that shocked France, prosecutors have alleged. Samuel Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty. The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference. He said Anzorov had told them he wanted ""to humiliate him, to hit him"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack. The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign that was orchestrated against Mr Paty. The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack. Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had faced threats for showing the cartoons He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons. The prosecutor's revelations come ahead of a national memorial service in Paris for Mr Paty. President Emmanuel Macron will attend the event at the Sorbonne University on Wednesday evening, along with the teacher's family and some 400 guests. He is expected to posthumously give Mr Paty France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur, Earlier, the president held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged co-operation in fighting terrorism. Mr Putin described the attack as a ""barbarous murder"". Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008. Mr Macron said he wanted to see a ""strengthening of Franco-Russian co-operation in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration"", the French presidency said. Russia has played down any association with the attacker. ""This person had lived in France for the past 12 years,"" a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris told the Tass news agency on Saturday. Police have raided some 40 homes following the attack, and the government also ordered a mosque to close for six months. The Pantin mosque, just north of Paris, was closed after it emerged it had shared videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty. In one clip, posted just days before the attack, it also shared his school's address. This video can not be played French minister: Lessons on freedom of expression will continue The mosque later expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing. Meanwhile, mosques in the south-western cities of Bordeaux and Beziers were put under police protection after they reported threats. ""Such actions are unacceptable on the soil of the Republic,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said in a tweet on Wednesday. On Tuesday, President Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing. He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community from the influence of radicalism. Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October. The history and geography teacher advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Charlie Hebdo republishes Muhammad cartoons Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Watch: Violence and hostility inside the French police Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslimsbecause Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God). The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication. This video can not be played Rallies in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty France's Muslim community, which is Europe's largest, comprises about 10% of the population. Some French Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.

"Comedy series The Good Place has been a hit for Netflix Demand for online entertainment surged when the world went into lockdown earlier this year. But how is Netflix faring after that initial boost? According to its latest results, Netflix added just 2.2 million new subscribers in the three months to 30 September, as the surge of demand for its services prompted by the pandemic faded. While it had warned that a slowdown was likely, the final figure came in below its July forecast of 2.5 million, sending the firm's shares down 5% in after-hours trade. ""The pandemic streaming party has come to an end,"" Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, declared. Still, Netflix reminded investors that it's still on track for a record number of 34 million new subscribers in 2020 - or more than 200 million overall. TV watching and streaming surge during lockdown Netflix faces Texas legal claim over 'lewd' film Charlize Theron stars in The Old Guard, which Netflix said was its top production in the quarter Netflix said 78 million member households watched The Old Guard, a Netflix original, in the first four weeks after its launch, making it the firm's most popular title of the quarter. Enola Holmes, Project Power and The Kissing Booth 2 were also popular, attracting 76 million, 75 million and 66 million households in the first four weeks after their debut. Of course, those figures should be taken with a grain of salt - Netflix counts any viewing time of more than two minutes towards its tally. And the viewer numbers it shares are focused on its own original productions. The number of international subscribers to Netflix had already eclipsed those in the US - and overseas growth continues to be critical. In the most recent quarter, the strongest subscriber growth occurred in its Asia Pacific region, which accounted for more than one million new subscribers - almost half of the sign-ups. The firm boasted that it now claims memberships in a ""double-digit"" share of broadband-connected homes in Japan and South Korea. But the firm still makes its most revenue per user in the US, so retention in its home market is key, especially as competition from rivals like Disney and HBO heats up. On that score, Netflix sought to reassure investors, writing inits quarterly update,externalthat ""retention remains healthy and engagement per member household was up solidly"" compared to last year. The shutdown in film and television productions, forced by lockdowns this spring, has placed a major focus on how Netflix and its competitors will get hold of new offerings to retain their members. Netflix downplayed those concerns, saying it was making ""good and careful progress"" in production and it expected the number of Netflix productions launching next year to exceed 2020 in every quarter. Netflix stands to benefit from the struggles of cinema operators, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But as homebound audiences burn through material at a faster rate, costs will increase - and could push the company to raise prices, she warned. ""Original content might keep customers, but it costs a pretty penny, and is downright ghoulish for the bottom line,"" she said. ""If consumers are expected to burn through content at a faster rate, the cash flow hole will in theory get bigger."" The firm reported a record $790 million in quarterly profit, as revenue increased more than expected to $6.4bn, thanks in part to the appreciation of the euro against the dollar. And the firm said its profit margins have also improved, due to the temporary slowdown in production.

"Donald Trump, pictured here with President Xi Jinping, has portrayed China as a threat to the US US President Donald Trump has a Chinese bank account and spent years pursuing business projects in the country, the New York Times has reported. The account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management and paid local taxes between 2013 and 2015. It was set up ""to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia"", according to a Trump spokesman. Mr Trump has been critical of US firms doing business in China and sparked a trade war between the two countries. TheNY Times revealed the account,externalafter obtaining Mr Trump's tax records, which included both personal and company financial details. What you need to know about the Trump tax story The newspaper's previous reports show he paid $750 (Â£580) in US federal taxes in 2016 and 2017, when he became president. The Chinese bank account has paid out $188,561 in local taxes. Mr Trump has been critical of presidential candidate rival Joe Biden and his policies towards China in the lead-up to the US election, taking place on 3 November. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? The Trump administration has singled out Mr Biden's son Hunter and made unsubstantiated claims about his dealings with China. Joe Biden's income tax returns and public financial disclosures show no business dealings connected to China. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organisation, described the NY Times story as ""pure speculation"" and said that it made ""incorrect assumptions"". He told the paper that Trump International Hotels Management had ""opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes"". ""No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialised and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,"" Mr Garten said. ""Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose,"" he told the NY Times. The US president has multiple business interests both in the US and overseas. These include golf courses in Scotland and Ireland and a chain of five-star luxury hotels. The NY Times reported that Mr Trump maintains foreign bank accounts in China, Britain and Ireland. In August, Mr Trump said he wanted to offer tax credits to entice US firms to move factories out of China. He also threatened to strip government contracts from firms that continue to outsource work to China. In a speech, Mr Trump vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, saying ""we will end our reliance on China"". This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world In stark contrast, the NY Times report details how Mr Trump has been looking to land business in China. His efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office. Trump dangles cash for US firms moving from China Trump administration plans Chinese tech crackdown Who does China really want to win US election? The tax records it obtained show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over a number of years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018. But the US president's plans in China have been largely driven by Trump International Hotels Management, through direct ownership of THC China Development, according to the NY Times. Analysis by Kerry Allen, BBC China media analyst Donald Trump's tax payments to China have delighted and bemused social media users there, who have been closely following reports scrutinising his tax affairs. Memes and comments referring to ""Comrade Trump"" are lighting up the popular Sina Weibo social network. Users are joking that he has been ""paying his [Communist] party membership"" and ""the motherland will never forget"" his contributions. But many are incredulous he apparently paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax to China, yet very little in the US. ""He has paid China more than 250 times the tax he has paid his own ugly country,"" says one user, noting theNew York Times' recent report alleging Mr Trump paid just $750,external(Â£580) in US taxes in 2016 and 2017. Others are incredulous that theUS president embarked on a trade warwhile seemingly pursuing his own personal Chinese interests. No further details, however, have emerged in Chinese media reports on the bank account unearthed by the New York Times. With two weeks to go until the election, Mr Biden again remained off the trail on Tuesday as he prepared for the final presidential debate on Thursday. The Democrat is maintaining a steady lead in national opinion polls. Mr Trump, making his own pitch to the American people, again insisted the US was weathering the pandemic well - despite figures showing rising cases and hospitalisations in almost all states. First Lady Melania Trump pulled out of a planned campaign appearance - a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the president - because of lingering symptoms of her Covid-19 infection. On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Mr Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

With average earnings lower than a year earlier (based on official figures for May to July), and now the inflation rate only having risen slightly, the backstop of a 2.5% increase kicks in. This follows three years of higher rises and is well down on the 3.9% increase seen in April this year. Although it is still to be officially confirmed, it should mean: The new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) should go up by Â£4.40 a week from Â£175.20 a week at present to Â£179.60Â a week in April The old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) should go up by Â£3.35 a week from Â£134.25 a week now to Â£137.60 a week in April The expected increase could reignite debate over fairness between the generations. On one hand, the rise will seem high to those who have lost jobs during the pandemic, but the UK state pension remains one of the least generous in western economies. The age at which people now start to receive the UK state pension recently hit 66 for men and women. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Comedy series The Good Place has been a hit for Netflix Demand for online entertainment surged when the world went into lockdown earlier this year. But how is Netflix faring after that initial boost? According to its latest results, Netflix added just 2.2 million new subscribers in the three months to 30 September, as the surge of demand for its services prompted by the pandemic faded. While it had warned that a slowdown was likely, the final figure came in below its July forecast of 2.5 million, sending the firm's shares down 5% in after-hours trade. ""The pandemic streaming party has come to an end,"" Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, declared. Still, Netflix reminded investors that it's still on track for a record number of 34 million new subscribers in 2020 - or more than 200 million overall. TV watching and streaming surge during lockdown Netflix faces Texas legal claim over 'lewd' film Charlize Theron stars in The Old Guard, which Netflix said was its top production in the quarter Netflix said 78 million member households watched The Old Guard, a Netflix original, in the first four weeks after its launch, making it the firm's most popular title of the quarter. Enola Holmes, Project Power and The Kissing Booth 2 were also popular, attracting 76 million, 75 million and 66 million households in the first four weeks after their debut. Of course, those figures should be taken with a grain of salt - Netflix counts any viewing time of more than two minutes towards its tally. And the viewer numbers it shares are focused on its own original productions. The number of international subscribers to Netflix had already eclipsed those in the US - and overseas growth continues to be critical. In the most recent quarter, the strongest subscriber growth occurred in its Asia Pacific region, which accounted for more than one million new subscribers - almost half of the sign-ups. The firm boasted that it now claims memberships in a ""double-digit"" share of broadband-connected homes in Japan and South Korea. But the firm still makes its most revenue per user in the US, so retention in its home market is key, especially as competition from rivals like Disney and HBO heats up. On that score, Netflix sought to reassure investors, writing inits quarterly update,externalthat ""retention remains healthy and engagement per member household was up solidly"" compared to last year. The shutdown in film and television productions, forced by lockdowns this spring, has placed a major focus on how Netflix and its competitors will get hold of new offerings to retain their members. Netflix downplayed those concerns, saying it was making ""good and careful progress"" in production and it expected the number of Netflix productions launching next year to exceed 2020 in every quarter. Netflix stands to benefit from the struggles of cinema operators, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But as homebound audiences burn through material at a faster rate, costs will increase - and could push the company to raise prices, she warned. ""Original content might keep customers, but it costs a pretty penny, and is downright ghoulish for the bottom line,"" she said. ""If consumers are expected to burn through content at a faster rate, the cash flow hole will in theory get bigger."" The firm reported a record $790 million in quarterly profit, as revenue increased more than expected to $6.4bn, thanks in part to the appreciation of the euro against the dollar. And the firm said its profit margins have also improved, due to the temporary slowdown in production.

"This video can not be played PSG 1-2 Man Utd: Scott McTominay played first half with one eye - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Marcus Rashford repeated his late heroics against Paris St-Germain with a superb winner as Manchester United marked their return to the Champions League with a fine win at the home of last season's beaten finalists. Rashford's stoppage-time penalty sealed a famous victory at theParc des Princes 18 months agoand the England striker was again on target to ensure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side took maximum points from their opening match in a formidable group. The visitors had excelled in a first half which saw Bruno Fernandes stroke them ahead with a twice-taken penalty. But the multiple French champions were far stronger and threatening in the second half and deservedly drew level when United striker Anthony Martial headed into his own net. David de Gea had to put in a much-improved display in United's goal, making strong saves to deny PSG's superstar duo Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. And the sides looked set to share the points when Rashford collected a pass from substitute Paul Pogba, rolled away from a defender and fired in off the base of the post from 20 yards. Reaction to all of Tuesday's Champions League action Champions League & Europa League guide Quiz: Name the teams in the group stage Rashford's penalty completed a stunning comeback in 2019 which all but cemented the case for Solskjaer's temporary reign to be made permanent, turning a delighted Rio Ferdinand - the former United defender turned BT Sport pundit - into a meme in the process. Solskjaer has not been able to maintain that blistering success since becoming full-time manager, but once again the Norwegian was able to conjure a victory against the odds. Without captain Harry Maguire and midfielder Pogba, United played a back five - with defender Axel Tuanzebe being summoned from the wilderness and shining on his first appearance of 2020. Twice the 22-year-old kept stride with the rapid Mbappe and made fine challenges in an impressive display. At the other end, United's opener came from a more familiar route - Fernandes converting a penalty after Martial was tripped. It was, remarkably, the 27th spot-kick awarded to United since the start of last season. Fernandes, the captain on the night, actually missed for the second time in three days, but Keylor Navas was clearly off his line before the save and the video assistant referee called it back. Fernandes went the same way; the goalkeeper went the other. PSG looked far more like their old selves after the break and United had to defend well - but Rashford was guilty of wasting a couple of chances on the counter-attack before his brilliant late winner. The rebuilding of Paris St-Germain has long been aimed solely at European glory - with domestic monopoly tied up years ago - and the run to thefinal just 58 days agolooked like a key juncture. Thomas Tuchel's side is packed with blistering talent, but question marks over their consistency have long been raised and this was another frustrating display. They moved the ball far too slowly in the first half and deserved to find themselves behind, even if De Gea was called into a double save from Angel di Maria and Layvin Kurzawa. Tuchel moved Di Maria deeper at half-time, sending on Everton loanee Moise Kean up front, and his side were better. De Gea again made a flying save to deny Mbappe after a typically brilliant run, and Kurzawa hit the crossbar with a miscued cross. Martial gave them a route back into the match when he nodded Neymar's inswinging corner into his own net, but United improved when Pogba came on. With RB Leipzig - semi-finalists last season -up and running with a win,it is now Tuchel's side who need to click into gear fast just to make it out of Group H. Paris St-Germain suffered a home defeat in a Champions League group game for the first time in 25 games, since losing 1-3 to CSKA Moscow in December 2004. Manchester United have scored nine own goals in the Champions League, more than any other side. Since the start of last season, United have been awarded 27 penalties and scored 22 of them, both highs among sides in Europe's big five leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) in that time. Since his debut for Manchester United in February, Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals than any other Premier League player (27 - 16 goals, 11 assists). Fernandes has scored 11 of his 12 penalties for United, more than any other player from Europe's big five leagues in that time. Anthony Martial is the second French player to score an own goal in the Champions League against French opposition, after Jeremy Mathieu for Barcelona, also against Paris St-Germain, in April 2015. PSG's Neymar has failed to score in four consecutive Champions League appearances for the first time since November 2013 (his first five games in the competition).

Already, a record 29 million ballots have been cast nationwide. So what were the big moments from today?  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis.

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

I don't know enough about Biden to feel comfortable enough to say 'he's my guy',"" he says. Pat in Indianapolis flies a Trump flag outside his house. ""Joe Biden's been a politician for 47 years and if you don't know anything about him now, what are you hoping to learn? ""Over the last several elections, we're voting for the lesser of the evils."" All the drivers agree that homelessness is something they see a lot. ""I go to LA every week, by the downtown,"" says Sunny in California. ""You see slum areas, under the bridges. I don't think anybody's fixing that. It feels like they don't even look at it."" He wants a candidate who can help him feel safer at work. ""My vote goes to the person doing something for trucking."" Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond.

Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"Royal Mail will start collecting parcels and mail from people's homes from Wednesday as it tries to grab a bigger share of the parcel market. The firm is trying to capitalise on a rise in online shopping which has been accelerated by the coronavirus crisis. Royal Mail has seen parcel deliveries increase in recent years but is still on track to make a loss in 2020. The move to collecting could be beneficial if the company can work out logistical issues, an analyst said. Royal Mail, which already delivers parcels, is joining an already crowded parcel-collection market where it faces rivals such as DPD, Hermes and DHL. Its Parcel Collect service, which has been trialled in parts of the west of England, will be available every day except Sunday, and there will be 72p charge per parcel, plus postage costs. Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Royal Mail set for 'material loss' despite jump in parcels Pre-paid return packages can be collected for 60p per item. People running their own business from home will be able to use the service, along with consumers, a Royal Mail spokesperson said. The firm said it was ""one of the biggest changes to the daily delivery since the launch of the post box in 1852"". By Ramzan Karmali Royal Mail says it has found a solution for its customers who have parcels to send but can't face the queues in their local post office. The firm's new ""Parcel Collect""  service will operate six days a week and you'll be able to send up to five parcels at a time. Your local postman or postwoman will either collect your parcels from your front door or a designated safe space and the service will be part of their daily round. To use the service you have to book online (www.royalmail.com/bookcollection or via their app) - this can be done from five days in advance up to midnight the day before collection. Customers will have to make sure their postage is paid for, print their own labels and then pay for the service online. The charge for using the service is 72p per parcel, in addition to postage costs. Parcel Collect is also available for pre-paid return items at a cost of 60p per item. The firm is under pressure to find new revenue lines after seeing the number of letters it delivers halve over the last 16 years due to the popularity of email. During that time its parcel deliveries have increased greatly, and it now hopes to tap into the booming returns market, as online shoppers seek to change items bought online. The company had already made moves to enter the parcel market, launching parcel post boxes last year. However, historically Royal Mail has underinvested in its parcel services, and only launched automated parcel sorting in 2017, according to Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett. Mr Hyett said the new service would see a ""massive increase"" in its capacity, which would require a ""significant amount of investment"" and a ""high degree of planning and organisation"" which had sometimes been lacking. However, he said that if Royal Mail managed to get it right, it could help mitigate losses it incurs through its obligation to provide a ""universal service"" across the UK. For example, currently it must deliver to more isolated places in the UK which drags on its profits. But being able to collect from those locations could help it maximise its returns, Mr Hyett said.
