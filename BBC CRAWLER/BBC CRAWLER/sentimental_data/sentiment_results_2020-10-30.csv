"The new lockdown measures will last until at least the middle of December Belgium has announced a return to a national lockdown as the latest coronavirus figures show it has the highest infection rate in Europe. Non-essential shops and businesses offering personal services like hair salons have been ordered to close from Monday until the middle of December. Any gatherings in public spaces must be limited to a maximum of four people. Supermarkets can only sell essential goods and households are allowed just one visitor. Autumn school holidays have also been extended until 15 November. The existing night-time curfew measures and closures of bars and restaurants will remain in place. Belgium facing 'tsunami' of new infections Belgian doctors with coronavirus asked to keep working Belgium suffered one of the highest death rates in the world during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring. It now has the highest infection rate in Europe with more than half of the 2,000 beds in its intensive care units (ICU) already occupied by Covid patients. On Friday, Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the country ""finds itself in a health emergency"". ""The pressure on our hospitals is huge,"" he said, while announcing the new measures, adding: ""These are last-chance measures if we want to get the figures down."" Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the new lockdown ""will not plunge people into isolation"". ""It's a lockdown, but a lockdown that allows factories to operate, that will allow schools to open cautiously,"" he said. This video can not be played Gavin Lee reported on the situation in Belgium earlier this month There have been 1,600 infections and 8.4 deaths per 100,000 people in the last 14 days,external, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The decision is a compromise between Belgium's federal and regional governments which have sometimes pursued different policies during the crisis. Belgium's death rate is second only to the Czech Republic in the EU. More than 11,300 people have died in the country of around 11.5 million. Much of Europe is battling with soaring infection rates. Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? France is now in a new national lockdownthat will last at least a month. Schools and workplaces remain open, but people need permits to leave home. Germany will introduce ""lockdown light"" measures on Monday, with tighter restrictions on people's movements, though not as tough as the Belgian and French regimes. Poland now has its highest level of restrictions to date, with public gatherings banned, most schools closed and restaurants and cafes only offering take-away service. And in Spain there have been clashes between police and demonstrators in Barcelona, who turned out in the streets against new coronavirus restrictions - including a curfew and a ban on leaving the city over the weekend. Some protesters in masks threw objects at officers in full riot gear. Local police said 20 officers were injured and 12 people arrested.

"EDF says Sizewell C will provide electricity for six million homes and create 25,000 jobs The government is close to giving the green light to a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. The BBC has learned that talks with the Sizewell contractor, EDF, have intensified in recent weeks. This comes after projects in Anglesey and Cumbria have suffered major setbacks when Japanese firms Hitachi and Toshiba pulled out. Government officials are insisting  that it ""remains committed to new nuclear"". Although final approval is subject to a planning process, the final decision rests with the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy. This commitment to new nuclear may be included as part of a 10-point government plan to be published in early November. That plan is expected ahead of a detailed government white paper in late November which will attempt to set out the course of UK energy policy for decades to come. Unions have warned that a failure to transfer jobs, skills and new opportunities from the current project under construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset to Sizewell in Suffolk would put thousands of high skilled jobs at risk. The details of how new reactors at Sizewell will be paid for are still being hammered out. The government is considering taking an ownership stake and consumers may see a small addition to their bills to pay for the project as it is being built, in order to drive down the costs of financing a project that may cost up to Â£20bn and take about 10 years to build. The bigger the government stake, the smaller the call on consumers to ""pay as you go"" for the development and construction costs. This funding model has been treated with suspicion before, as opponents say it transfers the risk of delays and budget overruns from the contractor to the consumer and the taxpayer. However, the BBC understands that the fact Sizewell C is a carbon copy of Hinkley - which has seen work on a second reactor there completed 30% more quickly than the first - is thought to have substantially mitigated that risk. One of the reasons that the electricity that Hinkley will one day produce is so expensive (Â£92.50 per megawatt hour, compared with gas and wind at about Â£40) is that the constructors were required to shoulder the risk of any cost overruns themselves. EDF estimates that the cost of electricity produced at Sizewell will be somewhere between Â£40 and Â£60. The government hopes that the regular payments from both the government and consumers will encourage private sector investors like pension funds to also take an ownership stake in the project. Hitachi scrapped plans for a Â£20bn nuclear plant at Wylfa last month There are three reasons that Sizewell C is expected to get government blessing: The government has recently confirmed that it ""remains committed to new nuclear"" as part of a mix of low-carbon electricity production. At the moment, Sizewell C is realistically the only horse in the race. Of the original six sites earmarked a decade ago for a new fleet of nuclear reactors, three (Wylfa, Moorside and Oldbury) have seen contractors pull out, with only one already under construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Plans for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have attracted interest and research investment from the government, but are thought to be many years from being a realistic alternative to big nuclear plants. Rolls Royce, which is spearheading this research and development, may disagree, but as one industry source put it, ""I don't think that anyone really thinks that SMRs are a thing just yet."" That means Sizewell C is the only realistic option left on the table. Even some of the most prominent evangelists for renewables such as wind and solar privately admit that you can't get to net zero by renewables alone without compromising the stability of the electricity grid. There are times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. It is possible to develop enhanced battery storage and use ""smart grid"" technology to flick between different renewable sources, but to do that would require billions of investment in a radical redesign of the national grid to provide that kind of flexibility and connectivity. Nuclear currently supplies more than 20% of all UK electricity and although offshore wind can be expanded enormously, keeping pace with the soaring demand expected for electricity in our transport and heating systems would be asking too much of renewables. We will need gigantic quantities of low-carbon electricity and when it's built and running, that's what nuclear gives you. The new plants at Hinkley and Sizewell alone are expected to supply 14% of the UK's electricity needs. A decision to green-light Sizewell will be welcomed by unions as an important move to preserve jobs and expertise in a high-skilled and well-paid sector. The union Unite has called on the government to approve the plans, arguing that 10,000 jobs are ""in the balance"" if the project does not go ahead. The government recognises this. Energy industry sources agreed, telling the BBC that there is a ""compelling industrial case"" for the ""lift and shift"" of jobs and skills from the plant currently under construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset to Sizewell in Suffolk. Contractors EDF claim Sizewell will create and support 70,000 direct and indirect jobs throughout the UK. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) The road to clean energy But there are also problems: Chinese state-owned company CGN already owns a 33% stake in Hinkley Point C in Somerset, currently under construction by French firm EDF, which owns the other two-thirds. The Chinese firm also took a 20% stake in the development phase of Sizewell on the understanding it would participate in the construction phase and then land the ultimate prize of building a reactor of its own design at Bradwell in Essex. Sources within government and the industry say Chinese involvement in designing and running its own design nuclear reactor on UK soil ""looks dead"", given revived security concerns and deteriorating diplomatic relations after the government's decision to phase out Chinese firm Huawei's equipment from a new generation of telecommunication networks. If a mobile network is considered too sensitive, it's hard to argue that a nuclear power station is not. Sources close to CGN say the company recognises the new political realities, but still hopes to be able to be an ""arm's-length suppler"" to the project, having built a similar plant in Taishan which is already up and running. Local opinion in Suffolk is mixed. Some residents of the surrounding picturesque and well-heeled villages fear a future of HGVs thundering down country lanes and have mounted campaigns to stop the project. Others point to the benefits of the many thousands of jobs the project will create in an area that also includes some of the UK's most deprived areas. One Stop Sizewell poster had ""Jobs not Snobs"" written over it. Opponents of Sizewell say that big nuclear is a technology of the past. The future lies with a rapid expansion of renewables, along with the development of large-scale battery technology and technology that optimises the supply and demand of energy in real time. The chairman of Together Against Sizewell C, Pete Wilkinson, argues that ""renewables out-compete nuclear on every front - cost, waste, jobs, CO2 and time for deployment"". Decarbonising our electricity supply is crucial if the UK is to meet its net zero target by 2050. But at the moment there aren't many choices when it comes to low carbon energy. The UK isn't a great location for solar power.  We don't have much sun, or much land. Wind, particularly offshore wind, is a much better bet. Boris Johnson has said he expects offshore wind to be able to generate 40GW for the UK by 2030 - more than half current electricity demand. However, that's already an ambitious target and it is hard to see how the industry could be developed more rapidly than that. And you've also got the question of what to do when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Battery and other energy storage technologies are developing rapidly but are expensive. Meanwhile, other more dependable low carbon technologies - carbon capture and storage, geothermal, wave and tidal power etc - may be promising but are not yet available at scale. Leaving nuclear power pretty much the only remaining low carbon option. One of the UK's leading energy experts, Prof Dieter Helm, says some of the numbers on cost are misleading, as basic comparisons underestimate the cost of intermittency (when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine) and the necessary changes to the overall design of the energy grid to accommodate the large number of turbines and solar farms you would need to replace the constant flow (baseload) of energy you get from nuclear power. ""No one thinks nuclear can solve the problem, but it's also hard to see how wind gets you there either and in fact neither of them claim that to be the case. One thing is certain, the government has to stop dithering and start putting some stakes in the ground,"" he says. Ultimately, for the government, it is neither desirable nor necessary for this to be an either/or decision. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said the road to net zero will require a combination of technologies. It will also cost a lot of money which, one way or another, will be paid by consumers and taxpayers. Decarbonising the electricity supply is the relatively easy bit. Decarbonising industrial processes and the way we heat our homes is the hard bit. There are 25 million gas boilers in our homes which will need replacing, for a start. The CCC estimates the cost of getting to net zero by 2050 at a TRILLION pounds. That means spending Â£30bn a year - every year - for the next 30 years. That's roughly 1.5% of UK GDP. Put that way, it sounds possible but is still a very, very formidable target.

"This video can not be played Powerful earthquake destroys buildings and causes flooding on Turkey's Aegean coast A powerful earthquake has struck off Turkey's Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos, destroying homes and killing at least 22 people. The 7.0 magnitude tremor was centred off Turkey's Izmir province, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. Turkey put the magnitude lower, at 6.6, saying 20 people had died and 786 were injured in the province of Izmir. On Samos, two teenagers were killed. The shallow tremor triggered a mini-tsunami that flooded Izmir and Samos. The authorities in Izmir, the provincial capital, are now setting up a tent area to house about 2,000 people overnight, amid fears that more buildings could collapse. The authorities said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Rescuers continued to dig through concrete blocks after darkness fell, hoping to find more survivors. The USGS said the quake - which was felt as far away as Athens and Istanbul - struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), although Turkish officials said it was 16km below ground. Turkey and Greece both sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Rescuers and local residents are frantically searching for survivors in Izmir The death toll could rise further as a number of people are feared trapped under the rubble in Izmir In Izmir, Turkey's third largest city with the population of nearly three million, many people were seen running out into the streets in panic and fear after the quake struck. At least 20 buildings collapsed. Videos have been posted on social media appearing to show the moment one multi-storey building went down, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Istanbul reports. Other footage shows local people scrambling over rubble looking for survivors. There were reports of flooding in the city after the sea level rose, and some fishermen are said to be missing. ""It was a really strong shaker almost enough to knock you off your feet. Running out of the house with my children was like a drunken wobble,"" Chris Bedford, a retired British teacher who lives in Urla, west of Izmir, told the BBC. This video can not be played Footage shows town on Greek island of Samos flooded by earthquake One of the 20 confirmed victims drowned, the Turkish emergencies agency said. Yasar Keles, an official in Sigacik, near Izmir, told BBC Turkish that a person died after their wheelchair was hit and overturned by the rising water. Officials later said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government would help those affected by the quake ""with all the means available to our state"". On Samos, residents were urged to stay outdoors as aftershocks continued In Greece, two teenagers were killed when a wall collapsed on Samos. Eight people were injured across the island. A mini-tsunami flooded the port of Samos and a number of buildings were damaged. Greek officials put the magnitude of the tremor at 6.7. ""We felt it very strongly,"" local journalist Manos Stefanakis told the BBC, adding that smaller aftershocks were continuing. He said it was the biggest tremor to have hit the island since 1904. Fareid Atta, another Samos-based journalist, told the BBC that the damage was ""quite extensive along the seafront"" of the island's main town. ""Many businesses will be going under after this,"" he said. Residents were urged to stay outdoors and keep away from coastal areas. About 45,000 people live on Samos. Jude Wiggins, co-ordinator at women's centre for refugees in Samos The building began to shake in our centre so we ran out. Soon the roads began to flood. We were scared there would be a tsunami so we ran up the hill. About 45,000 people live on Samos I was in the kitchen. The washing machine was going and I thought it was just doing that thing when it shakes and moves around at first. But the fridge was moving. I ran out. Women were running everywhere. For a lot of the women it's quite traumatic as they've come from places like Syria and it could have felt like they were being bombed or something. At some point everybody started to run. People were panicking. Our house is not safe to stay in as there are a lot of cracks. For the people in the camps, they've lost everything in their own countries, they lost everything again in a fire and now lots of them have lost the tents they were sleeping in. Reports said Friday's quake was also felt on the Greek island of Crete. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he called Mr Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries"". ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,external,"" Mr Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet. Mr Erdogan later responded, also by posting a tweet. ""I offer my condolences to all of Greece on behalf of myself and the Turkish people,external,"" he wrote. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he added. Relations between Greece and Turkey have been particularly strained in recent months by a dispute relating to control of territorial waters in the Mediterranean and the resources beneath them. In Januarymore than 30 people were killed and more than 1,600 injuredwhen an earthquake struck Sivrice in Turkey's eastern Elazig province. In July 2019, the Greek capital Athens was hit by a tremor thatknocked out power to large parts of the city. A powerful quake that struck the Turkish city of Izmit, near Istanbul, in 1999 killed about 17,000 people. Are you in an area affected by the earthquake?

"The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said PM Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". Mr Drakeford said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"". A UK cabinet minister said earlier this week it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be. Environment Secretary George Eustice warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". His comments came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called for a ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be Call for UK-wide Christmas Covid rules 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' Mr Johnson's government has responsibility for health policy - including Covid-19 restrictions and limits on gatherings - in England. Similar rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by the countries' devolved governments. This means different restrictions are in place across the UK, which, it is argued, could cause confusion for people travelling during the holidays.

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Speaking at a press conference in Cardiff, Mr Drakeford said Mr Johnson had written to him ""at the start of this week"" to expect an invitation from Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to discuss a ""common approach to Christmas"". ""We've done our best to secure that meeting this week, it hasn't yet been forthcoming,"" he told reporters. ""We need to get round the table together, we need to share that information, we need to share ideas."" He added he would like to see ""as common an approach as we can craft together"" over Christmas, while ""recognising that the state of the virus and the response that's being made does differ from one part of the UK to another"". Sheffield is among English cities in the tier 3 ""very high"" alert level of tightest restrictions. In non-pandemic years, millions of people move around the UK at Christmas time to see friends or families, packing out trains and clogging up motorways. If household gatherings continue to be limited in number, many of the usual larger gatherings would be illegal this year. Scotlandis due to move to a five-tier systemof virus alert levels from 2 November, with various levels of restrictions on indoor gatherings and travel. Wales has started anational lockdownuntil 9 November, under which people are only able to leave home for limited reasons, with a ban on households mixing. Northern Ireland has also introduced additional restrictions, including an extended two-week half term for schools. From midnight on Friday, over half of England's population will be living under tier 2 or tier 3 restrictions, under which household mixing indoors is banned. Speaking after Mr Drakeford's press conference, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there should be ""comprehensive uniform guidance for family gatherings"". He added that ""fractured guidance"" should not be allowed to ""confuse and divide people"" over the festive period. A UK government spokesperson said minsters had worked closely with the devolved administrations in tackling the pandemic. They added that meetings and calls with devolved leaders and officials would ""continue to be a key part of the planning and communication of the overall response.""

"This video can not be played Len McCluskey urges Unite members to stay in Labour Allies of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have urged party members who are angry about his suspension not to quit the party. Ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell joined Unite union boss Len McCluskey in calling for unity, as they argue for the decision to be overturned. Some members have publicly declared their intention to quit over the treatment of their former leader. But the move has been backed by others, including former party members. The party suspended Mr Corbyn over his reaction to areport saying Labour had broken equality laws over its handling of anti-Semitism allegations. He is facing an internal inquiry over the comments, in which he acknowledged the problems but said the scale of Labour's anti-Semitism issues had been ""overstated"". It was this comment that led to his suspension. A crowd-funding page set up to cover any legal costs Mr Corbyn may face has raised over Â£350,000. Starmer defends Corbyn's suspension from Labour Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? During an online event on Friday evening hosted by Momentum, the left-wing campaign group, several former shadow cabinet members and allies of Mr Corbyn spoke out against the decision to suspend him. Mr McDonnell said the decision ""must be reversed,"" but the ""way we do that is to stay in the Labour party,"" adding ""civil war"" would not help the party's cause. Equally, former shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said the move was ""unjust,"" but called for members to ""make our stand today and not walk away"" - and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called for members to ""come together"" to fight the suspension. Sir Keir Starmer, who was elected to replace Mr Corbyn as leader in April, said he had been ""disappointed"" by his predecessor's response to a highly critical report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) on the handling of anti-Semitism complaints. Defending Mr Corbyn's suspension, Sir Keir told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I made it clear the Labour Party I lead will not tolerate anti-Semitism, neither will it tolerate the argument that denies or minimises anti-Semitism in the Labour Party on the basis that it's exaggerated or a factional row."" This video can not be played Kier Starmer: ""An ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on"" Mr McCluskey - one of Mr Corbyn's biggest allies whose union bankrolled the party's election campaigns under his leadership - said the party should be concentrating on implementing the report's recommendations. He described Mr Corbyn's suspension from the party as a ""grave injustice"" but added that he hoped the issue can be resolved - and urged members angry about it to remain in the party. ""We need the party to be united. Working people out there need us, need a Labour government,"" he said. Is this the calm before the storm? The talk from those backing Jeremy Corbyn has been of discussion, of ""resolving"" the issue of his suspension for the sake of party unity. Sir Keir Starmer has been clear he is holding firm on the commitments he has made on anti-Semitism and that he is not going to get personally involved in the disciplinary complaint. Unsurprising really, given that not 24 hours beforehand the party was found to have breached equality law because staff in the previous leader's office did just that. This seems to leave little option but to let a formal disciplinary process run its course. On the one hand, that sends a strong signal from Sir Keir that the party has listened and learnt on anti-Semitism and that nobody is above the process. On the other, that potentially means weeks of unrest within the party which could threaten to blow up into another big, divisive row at any moment. Not quite the ""line in the sand"" then that the Labour leader had hoped for. Many have used social media to share their intention to end their membership subscriptions, including Andrew Cassidy, 44, from near Glasgow, who has been a Labour member for 10 years. ""The facts, as far as I see them, are that Jeremy Corbyn has shown a lifelong distaste for racism of any bent,"" he told the PA news agency. ""Being pro-Palestinian is conflated as anti-Semitism, both by the mainstream media and now by Labour Party grandees."" He described Mr Corbyn as ""a good man"" who had been ""hung out to dry in order to distance (Sir Keir) Starmer's Labour from the progressive, inclusive party that Corbyn aimed for"". Another twitter user, Helen Hurd, said: ""I have just resigned my membership of the Labour Party as of immediately, I remained a member in the mistaken belief the left needed a voice in the party but I can't do anymore, as a life long supporter I am really upset."" But others on social media said the news had encouraged them to consider joining the party again. Elliot Cohen, 50, from Hertfordshire told PA that he wanted to rejoin but would wait to see if the EHRC recommendations were implemented. He added: ""Corbyn's suspension - and Starmer's words since his election - are a good start."" And Frances Grey, who left the party in April 2019, told the BBC she had rejoined Labour after Thursday's announcement. She said Sir Keir had ""shown great promise and appears to be doing all the things an opposition party can possibly do and say against a government with an enormous majority. ""Then his action yesterday (Thursday) in expelling Corbyn just gave me even more hope, because he has accepted the role of working to make changes happen, not just to protest about things."" She added that she hoped Sir Keir would ""change things"" at the next election. Labour's membership soared under Mr Corbyn's leadership and stood at more than 500,000 at the time of the party's election contest in April.

"Police released a video ""showing the moment we forced our way in to Kasablanca"" Police have closed a shisha cafe after finding about 150 people inside, days after the venue was hit with a Â£10,000 fine for Covid-19 breaches. Officers forced their way in to Kasablanca in the Highgate area of Birmingham at 01:00 BST on 24 October. Videoposted on YouTube,externalshows officers forcing entry to the smokers' lounge on Moseley Street, with shrieks audible as they disperse the crowds. The venue had broken restrictions earlier this month, police said. Kasablanca had already been fined for breaking Covid regulations Birmingham and the wider West Midlands combined authority area has been widely predicted to move to tier three ""very high alert"" measures as soon as the end of next week, as infection rates continue to rise. In a separate incident, the owner of a venue in Smethwick, West Midlands, has been fined Â£10,000, after hosting a wedding celebration for more than 70 people. Ch Supt Andy Beard said: ""It's unacceptable that these businesses continue to flout the law, putting lives at risk and increasing the risk of infections as this deadly virus continues to spread. ""This is a difficult time for everyone, but we won't be able to control this pandemic and return to a sense of normality if this continues to happen."" Closed-down venues have their orders reviewed every week by the local authority and owners must prove they are complying with the law before reopening, the force said.

"The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said PM Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". Mr Drakeford said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"". A UK cabinet minister said earlier this week it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be. Environment Secretary George Eustice warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". His comments came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called for a ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be Call for UK-wide Christmas Covid rules 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' Mr Johnson's government has responsibility for health policy - including Covid-19 restrictions and limits on gatherings - in England. Similar rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by the countries' devolved governments. This means different restrictions are in place across the UK, which, it is argued, could cause confusion for people travelling during the holidays.

""We've done our best to secure that meeting this week, it hasn't yet been forthcoming,"" he told reporters. ""We need to get round the table together, we need to share that information, we need to share ideas."" He added he would like to see ""as common an approach as we can craft together"" over Christmas, while ""recognising that the state of the virus and the response that's being made does differ from one part of the UK to another"". Sheffield is among English cities in the tier 3 ""very high"" alert level of tightest restrictions. In non-pandemic years, millions of people move around the UK at Christmas time to see friends or families, packing out trains and clogging up motorways. If household gatherings continue to be limited in number, many of the usual larger gatherings would be illegal this year. Scotlandis due to move to a five-tier systemof virus alert levels from 2 November, with various levels of restrictions on indoor gatherings and travel. Wales has started anational lockdownuntil 9 November, under which people are only able to leave home for limited reasons, with a ban on households mixing. Northern Ireland has also introduced additional restrictions, including an extended two-week half term for schools. From midnight on Friday, over half of England's population will be living under tier 2 or tier 3 restrictions, under which household mixing indoors is banned. Speaking after Mr Drakeford's press conference, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there should be ""comprehensive uniform guidance for family gatherings"". He added that ""fractured guidance"" should not be allowed to ""confuse and divide people"" over the festive period. A UK government spokesperson said minsters had worked closely with the devolved administrations in tackling the pandemic. They added that meetings and calls with devolved leaders and officials would ""continue to be a key part of the planning and communication of the overall response.""

"An estimated 570,000 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics Cases of Covid-19 appear to be levelling off in the North East of England, the ONS data shows Covid is spreading ""significantly"" faster through England than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, Sage documents reveal UK's latest daily figures show 24,405 further positive cases and 274 more deaths as of Friday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends localised measures - he says the government is ""striving to avoid"" a ""blanket approach"" The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, Welsh first minister says Senior pupils will have to wear masks in class in areas under tighter restrictions in Scotland Nottinghamshire has now moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates West Yorkshire will move into tier three measures from Monday Edited by Sarah Collerton We are now closing our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us. Sarah Collerton was today's live page editor and the writers were Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Doug Faulkner and Cherry Wilson. We are winding down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"The two candidates - President Donald Trump and Joe Biden - head to the Midwest, another key battleground Some 84 million people have already voted ahead of election day on 3 November The country is on course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century Edited by Boer Deng Thanks for joining our live rolling coverage of the presidential as the countdown to election day on Tuesday continues. In today's developments:  We'll be back tomorrow with more campaign coverage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen to its lowest level since coronavirus lockdowns were implemented in March.

With just four days until election day, Biden has a solid lead nationally in opinion polls. But his advantage looks less assured in the battleground states, such as Florida and Wisconsin. Those states, which were won by Trump in 2016, will likely decide who ultimately wins the White House. Read more: Who is leading - Trump or Biden? Berlin's Madame Tussauds wax museum has moved their sculpture of Trump to the skip in anticipation of next's week's election. ""Dump Trump Make America Great Again,"" says an accompanying sign on the display, which has been placed by the museum's entrance. The US president is surrounded by bags of rubbish and cardboard cutouts of his tweets. Other US presidents, including Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan are positioned around him, outside of the dumpster. Tussaud's marketing manager Orkide Yalcindag told Reuters: âTodayâs activity is rather of a symbolic character ahead of the elections in the United States... We here at Madame Tussauds Berlin removed Donald Trumpâs waxwork as a preparatory measure.â Last month at New York's Madame Tussauds location, employees placed a face mask on the US president, to remind visitors to wear masks. Trump was just speaking in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""We win this state â you know what â itâs all over,"" the president said, referencing Wisconsin's importance as a battleground that could go either way. Trump also tells his supporters that this election is far more important than 2016, accusing Democrats of having gone too far left. ""If I don't sound like a typical politician it's because I'm not,"" Trump added. Wisconsin is currently seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases. The governor has warned of an impending crisis as hospitals are filling up. Earlier, Green Bay hospitals issued a statement warning that the president's Friday rally couldworsen the situation. However, Trump backers are still turning up at rallies and he has the support of at least one famous fan. Brett Favre, a former (and very famous) quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, the city's professional American football team, endorsed the president. While the US is seeing record early voting figures for next week's election, you may be surprised that it trails other developed countries when it comes to voter turnout. Historically, turnout in the US has hovered around 50% since the 1970s. The turnouts at the last general elections in India and France both beat that. Young people from these three nations tell us about their experiences of learning to vote, and whether it's stressed to them as a civic duty. This video can not be played US election: 'How we learn about voting in India, France and US' A Republican congressman in Georgia who held a pro-Trump rally on Tuesday while Joe Biden was visiting the state has tested positive for Covid-19. Representative Drew Ferguson said in a statement that he began to feel ill on Wednesday night and that, after consulting with his doctor, he decided to self-isolate at home. Governor Brian Kemp, who also co-hosted the rally, said on Friday that he too would be self-isolating after being exposed over the previous 48 hours to someone who had been infected.

You may think waiting 11 hours to vote would be the height of frustration, but not for one family in Georgia. ""We made it, y'all,"" says Johnta Austin in one viral video filmed as they reach the front of the queue, describing the lengthy process as an ""honour"". There are similar stories across the US. But globally, people have been wondering why on earth it takes so long to cast a vote. A British man wrote: ""Dear USA, I'm 58 and not once in my life have I had to queue to vote. Sort it out!"" One man in India pointed out that his country handles more election ballots than any other democracy in the world, and no such long queues have been seen in previous elections. Read the full story here. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Lindsay Stewart, 37, from Aberdeen, UK, asks:Is the electoral college system still fit for purpose today or does it unfairly skew the result? As it stands now, the more populous states (like California and Texas) are more underrepresented by the college than the lower population states, which some people say is not fair because it gives states where fewer people live more electoral power. All but two states say it's winner-takes-all for their electoral votes, so whoever gets the most votes gets all the electoral college votes too, whether that's a difference of one vote or one thousand. In 2016, this is how Trump was able to win big hitters in the electoral college like Florida and Wisconsin, even though his popular vote margin was slim. Essentially, this means much of the battle for the White House takes place in a handful of competitive states that could swing either way. (To get a better sense of this, try ourpredict the president battleground states game. It's fun, promise.) For decades, there's been a steady amount of support among the public to nix this system, according to the Pew Research Center. Right now, around 58% want to ditch it - but notably, attitudes have grown increasingly partisan since 2016, with more Republicans saying they support the system just as it is. One suggestion floated to fix this dissonance between the electoral college and popular vote is to award electors proportionally instead. But any changes to this voting system will need signing off from both two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states - which is nearly impossible.

The non-Iowan Republicans are in the Hawkeye States ostensibly to campaign for Trump - but some close political-watchers wonder if it could also be a sign that they are eyeing their chances of taking on the party mantle once he is out of office - whether after this election or the next one.  Tom Cotton's travel schedule seems to betray his presidential ambitions Iowa, along with New Hampshire, are two of the earliest states to hold primary elections, which are the contests where party candidates are determined before the general election. Senator Cotton, who seems to have obvious presidential ambitions, has been coming and going from Iowa and New Hampshire frequently in the past few months. You might remember him as the senator who described slavery as a ""necessary evil"" in a New York Times op-ed this summer. Trump spoke for over an hour in Michigan, wrapping up his first of three rallies for the day. Next up are rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and then Rochester, Minnesota. Biden delivered remarks in Des Moines, Iowa. Later today, he'll be at a drive-in rally in St Paul, Minnesota, and will give a speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. With only four days to go until election day, vote-counting starts, the candidates are both eager to stick to their established messages. Don't expect either of them to waiver too far from their scripts in the final days of the 2020 race. Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. James D Clark is an âold school Republicanâ who cast his vote for a Democrat for the first time. He graduated from Oxford University and is a tax lawyer who lives in Fairfax, Virginia.We featured him in our story about voters reacting to Donald Trumpâs tax returns. Despite his Republican past he âwould never dream of voting for Trump"" he says. He mailed his absentee ballot in for Joe Biden in September. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Experts tell me theyâre worried that false claims
about fraud and the supposed unreliability of mail-in voting could undermine
faith in the US election result. Our Reality Check team looked into the claims.They found that numerous national and state-level studies have shown that there have been isolated cases, but in general, voting fraud is extremely rare. That hasnât stopped President Trump and his supporters
from suggesting that they might not trust the result. On more than 70 occasions, the president has tweeted messages that cast doubt on or criticised mail-in
voting, mentioned voter fraud or referenced âriggedâ elections, according to an
analysis by BBC Monitoring Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center, a think tank, told me weâre in uncharted waters. âVoters will think - can I really trust that my vote
will be counted?â she says. âThatâs unprecedented in the United States.
Everyone has always trusted the democratic process.â How can you spot false claims about voting on your social media feeds before polling day? Here are some tips. Biden's now on stage in Iowa, speaking to an audience in their cars. So far he's jabbed at Trump calling himself a ""stable genius"", criticised his pandemic response and drawn attention to the Trump administration's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, the public health care scheme popularly known as Obamacare. Biden says he'll protect healthcare, restore the healthy economy that Trump ""squandered"", and take the pandemic seriously. ""Honk if you want America to be united again!"" Biden says, to a slew of, you guessed it, honks. ""This is a great crowd. We have a lot of great crowds,"" says Trump at the top of his remarks in Waterford Township, Michigan. Trump tells the supporters who turned up despite the near-freezing temperatures that they now ""are famous"" for having come to his rally. He repeats his oft-delivered attacks against Bidenâs running mate Kamala Harris. ""Crazy Bernie is like a conservative compared to her,â he says - a reference to democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders - in an effort to cast Harris, a former prosecutor, as a radical leftist. Itâs important to pronounce her name âexactly rightâ, he says, otherwise sheâll get upset. Confusingly, he also says that Harris herself is unable to correctly pronounce her own name. Spotting Fox News Host Laura Ingraham in the crowd, he points out that sheâs wearing a mask and says it because she is being âpolitically correctâ. Housing Secretary Ben Carson was also in the audience Some nuns, such as these Dominican Sisters of Hartland, Michigan, have made surprising appearances at Trump rallies Some 'politically correct' Trump supporters in Michigan A district attorney in the battleground state of Pennsylvania has warned that prison time may be in store for those engaged in a particular kind of election hi-jinx: uncertified poll watching. ""Iâve got a jail cell, and Iâve got criminal charges and you can stand in front of a Philadelphia jury - which, by the way, is a diverse jury - and you can explain why you thought it was OK to come to Philly and steal our votes,â Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner told CNN. ""Wannabe fascists stay home, and if your idea of how to have a democratic election is to steal it, then Iâve got something for you,"" Krasner, a Democrat, added. Poll watchers, as the name suggests, are people keeping an eye out for fraud and are usually a normal aspect of US elections. Usually, they are appointed by campaigns or campaign groups, and their names reported to officials ahead of time to be properly designated. This year, a row over the role has come up after Trump told his supporters to go to the polls and watch out for ""voting fraud"". The president has also repeatedly suggested he will only lose his re-election bid if there is widespread fraud. Democrats have responded by accusing Trump and his followers of trying to intimidate voters. Early voters in Philadelphia Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. Taylor Golden, 35, is a small business owner from Houston, Texas. She was not very interested in politics until Trump came along. She has already cast an early vote for the president. To show her enthusiasm for his re-election, she joined a Trump boat parade in Galveston, Texas. It was âa cold and dreary day, and the water was incredibly choppy,â but hundreds of boats joined. âEveryone was in high spirits and you could feel the love and pride in the air,â she said. âBeing surrounded with such patriotism is an honour."" Actor Noah Centineo is voting for the first time this year in a US election. The 24-year-old's organisation Favored Nations has also created a pop-up venue in Los Angeles, to encourage Gen Z and millennials to vote. More young people are expected to vote in the 2020 race than in previous elections. Historically, the US youth turn-out has been low compared to other age groups. Centineo told BBC World News America he hadnât voted before âout of protestâ. But now, he says, things have changed: This video can not be played US election: Why Noah Centineo is voting for the first time The Trump campaign has announced plans to host a rally on Election Day-eve in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Also of note on his Monday agenda is a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where massive protests took place earlier this summer after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. It's also where a white teenager allegedly shot and killed two protesters. Trump is rounding out the 2020 season with a final rally in the same city he held his last rally in 2016: Grand Rapids, Michigan. Here's what the president's schedule on Monday is looking like: Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Macnos Mutano, 32, from Sydney, Australia asks:Why can the electoral college override the popular vote? We've received thousands of questions from all of you, and the most common query is about the electoral college. This controversial part of the US election system is a source of confusion here too. When voters go to the polls, they aren't directly voting for the candidates. They're voting for ""electors"" - people who represent their candidate's party. The number of electors each state gets depends on how many lawmakers it has in Congress - and remember, House of Representatives seats are population-based, while every state gets two Senators. California has 55 electoral college votes whereas Wyoming only has three, and it all adds up to a total of 538 electors. So, in this system, not all states are created equal. It is getting the 270 electoral college votes that is needed to win the White House, not the popular vote, giving rise to presidents who may not be the most popular.

"Taxi drivers say their businesses have been severely disrupted by the pandemic Financial support for taxi drivers and coach and bus operators affected by Covid-19 restrictions has been approved by the executive. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said a Â£14m package would go directly to taxi drivers. She confirmed it would be a one-off cash payment of Â£1,500 to each taxi driver. Some drivers havecriticised this amount, describing it as ""a go-away payment"". They said this would not go far enough to cover lost earnings during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ms Mallon said she did not agree it was a ""go-away payment"". ""I've been very honest with people, as the minister for infrastructure I don't have the power to create schemes,"" she said. ""I was given these powers at the weekend, I've delivered a scheme to the executive today and I'm clearly saying I want it up and running as quickly as possible"". She said she recognised taxi drivers were struggling and she was doing what she could in difficult circumstances. She said her intention was to open the online application process on 9 November. Coach and bus operators will get a bespoke financial scheme worth a total of Â£5m that will be based on the number of buses in a firm's fleet. She said it would be capped at up to Â£100,000 for each operator. Speaking before the Â£14m package was confirmed, taxi driver Pat Meghan told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster a Â£1,500 one-off payment was ""very disappointing"". ""We've went through this process for the last seven months of talking to this department and trying to get somebody to take ownership of us and, finally on Tuesday, Nichola Mallon broke this big news to us that she's putting a bespoke scheme in place,"" he said. Taxi drivers welcome financial support package plans Support for taxi, coach and bus firms 'brought forward' Mr Meghan said some drivers have cars worth Â£52,000, which incur high monthly costs. ""Â£1,500 for the last seven months - we don't know what we're looking into in the future. Is it a payment to get us to go away?"" ""Our night time economy has gone, there's nothing out there, there's no one in the city centre, no offices,"" said Mr Meghan. ""We're down to 10-15% of the work we used to have. ""I haven't been out of the house this last fortnight, I haven't taken the car out because it costs money, money that I don't have to put fuel in my car.""

"An estimated 570,000 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics Cases of Covid-19 appear to be levelling off in the North East of England, the ONS data shows Covid is spreading ""significantly"" faster through England than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, Sage documents reveal UK's latest daily figures show 24,405 further positive cases and 274 more deaths as of Friday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends localised measures - he says the government is ""striving to avoid"" a ""blanket approach"" The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, Welsh first minister says Senior pupils will have to wear masks in class in areas under tighter restrictions in Scotland Nottinghamshire has now moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates West Yorkshire will move into tier three measures from Monday Edited by Sarah Collerton We are now closing our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us. Sarah Collerton was today's live page editor and the writers were Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Doug Faulkner and Cherry Wilson. We are winding down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"This video can not be played Powerful earthquake destroys buildings and causes flooding on Turkey's Aegean coast A powerful earthquake has struck off Turkey's Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos, destroying homes and killing at least 22 people. The 7.0 magnitude tremor was centred off Turkey's Izmir province, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. Turkey put the magnitude lower, at 6.6, saying 20 people had died and 786 were injured in the province of Izmir. On Samos, two teenagers were killed. The shallow tremor triggered a mini-tsunami that flooded Izmir and Samos. The authorities in Izmir, the provincial capital, are now setting up a tent area to house about 2,000 people overnight, amid fears that more buildings could collapse. The authorities said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Rescuers continued to dig through concrete blocks after darkness fell, hoping to find more survivors. The USGS said the quake - which was felt as far away as Athens and Istanbul - struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), although Turkish officials said it was 16km below ground. Turkey and Greece both sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Rescuers and local residents are frantically searching for survivors in Izmir The death toll could rise further as a number of people are feared trapped under the rubble in Izmir In Izmir, Turkey's third largest city with the population of nearly three million, many people were seen running out into the streets in panic and fear after the quake struck. At least 20 buildings collapsed. Videos have been posted on social media appearing to show the moment one multi-storey building went down, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Istanbul reports. Other footage shows local people scrambling over rubble looking for survivors. There were reports of flooding in the city after the sea level rose, and some fishermen are said to be missing. ""It was a really strong shaker almost enough to knock you off your feet. Running out of the house with my children was like a drunken wobble,"" Chris Bedford, a retired British teacher who lives in Urla, west of Izmir, told the BBC. This video can not be played Footage shows town on Greek island of Samos flooded by earthquake One of the 20 confirmed victims drowned, the Turkish emergencies agency said. Yasar Keles, an official in Sigacik, near Izmir, told BBC Turkish that a person died after their wheelchair was hit and overturned by the rising water. Officials later said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government would help those affected by the quake ""with all the means available to our state"". On Samos, residents were urged to stay outdoors as aftershocks continued In Greece, two teenagers were killed when a wall collapsed on Samos. Eight people were injured across the island. A mini-tsunami flooded the port of Samos and a number of buildings were damaged. Greek officials put the magnitude of the tremor at 6.7. ""We felt it very strongly,"" local journalist Manos Stefanakis told the BBC, adding that smaller aftershocks were continuing. He said it was the biggest tremor to have hit the island since 1904. Fareid Atta, another Samos-based journalist, told the BBC that the damage was ""quite extensive along the seafront"" of the island's main town. ""Many businesses will be going under after this,"" he said. Residents were urged to stay outdoors and keep away from coastal areas. About 45,000 people live on Samos. Jude Wiggins, co-ordinator at women's centre for refugees in Samos The building began to shake in our centre so we ran out. Soon the roads began to flood. We were scared there would be a tsunami so we ran up the hill. About 45,000 people live on Samos I was in the kitchen. The washing machine was going and I thought it was just doing that thing when it shakes and moves around at first. But the fridge was moving. I ran out. Women were running everywhere. For a lot of the women it's quite traumatic as they've come from places like Syria and it could have felt like they were being bombed or something. At some point everybody started to run. People were panicking. Our house is not safe to stay in as there are a lot of cracks. For the people in the camps, they've lost everything in their own countries, they lost everything again in a fire and now lots of them have lost the tents they were sleeping in. Reports said Friday's quake was also felt on the Greek island of Crete. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he called Mr Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries"". ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,external,"" Mr Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet. Mr Erdogan later responded, also by posting a tweet. ""I offer my condolences to all of Greece on behalf of myself and the Turkish people,external,"" he wrote. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he added. Relations between Greece and Turkey have been particularly strained in recent months by a dispute relating to control of territorial waters in the Mediterranean and the resources beneath them. In Januarymore than 30 people were killed and more than 1,600 injuredwhen an earthquake struck Sivrice in Turkey's eastern Elazig province. In July 2019, the Greek capital Athens was hit by a tremor thatknocked out power to large parts of the city. A powerful quake that struck the Turkish city of Izmit, near Istanbul, in 1999 killed about 17,000 people. Are you in an area affected by the earthquake?

"The UK's data privacy watchdog has fined the Marriott Hotels chain Â£18.4m for a major data breach that may have affected up to 339 million guests. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said names, contact information, and passport details may all have been compromised in a cyber-attack. The breach included seven million guest records for people in the UK. The ICO said the company failed to put appropriate safeguards in place but acknowledged it had improved. The first part of the cyber-attack happened in 2014, affecting the Starwood Hotels group, which was acquired by Marriott two years later. But until 2018, when the problem was first noticed, the attacker continued to have access to all affected systems, including: names email addresses phone numbers passport numbers arrival and departure information VIP status loyalty programme numbers On that basis, the ICO said Marriott had failed to protect personal data as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In some ways you can feel sorry for Marriott. In all the boardroom discussions about the company's takeover of Starwood, I bet it never realised that a hacker was already lurking inside the valuable databases they were buying. The cyber-criminals had been in the systems for years, and were effectively thrown into the merger deal without Marriott having a clue. Herein lies the issue, though - it seems the larger hotel didn't check what it was buying. The ICO report makes clear Marriott beefed up the security of Starwood's IT systems far too late and the hackers had free rein to move around, cherry-picking the data that would sell best on criminal forums. The fine is nothing like the Â£99m the ICO planned to issue, but it's still a massive deterrent for future companies. It may make executives planning their next big mergers look more carefully and cautiously at the databases they're about to acquire. ""Millions of people's data was affected by Marriott's failure,"" commissioner Elizabeth Denham said. ""Thousands contacted a helpline and others may have had to take action to protect their personal data because the company they trusted it with had not."" Different types of data were exposed for different guests, and some of the estimated 339 million may have represented duplicate records for repeat guests, making an exact count impossible. Despite imposing a fine, the ICO acknowledged that Marriott had acted quickly once it found the flaw, and had improved its systems since. In a statement, Marriott wrote that it ""deeply regrets the incident"". ""Marriott remains committed to the privacy and security of its guests' information and continues to make significant investments in security measures for its systems. ""The ICO recognises the steps taken by Marriott following discovery of the incident to promptly inform and protect the interests of its guests,"" it said.

"An estimated 570,000 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics Cases of Covid-19 appear to be levelling off in the North East of England, the ONS data shows Covid is spreading ""significantly"" faster through England than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, Sage documents reveal UK's latest daily figures show 24,405 further positive cases and 274 more deaths as of Friday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends localised measures - he says the government is ""striving to avoid"" a ""blanket approach"" The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, Welsh first minister says Senior pupils will have to wear masks in class in areas under tighter restrictions in Scotland Nottinghamshire has now moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates West Yorkshire will move into tier three measures from Monday Edited by Sarah Collerton We are now closing our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us. Sarah Collerton was today's live page editor and the writers were Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Doug Faulkner and Cherry Wilson. We are winding down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"The UK's data privacy watchdog has fined the Marriott Hotels chain Â£18.4m for a major data breach that may have affected up to 339 million guests. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said names, contact information, and passport details may all have been compromised in a cyber-attack. The breach included seven million guest records for people in the UK. The ICO said the company failed to put appropriate safeguards in place but acknowledged it had improved. The first part of the cyber-attack happened in 2014, affecting the Starwood Hotels group, which was acquired by Marriott two years later. But until 2018, when the problem was first noticed, the attacker continued to have access to all affected systems, including: names email addresses phone numbers passport numbers arrival and departure information VIP status loyalty programme numbers On that basis, the ICO said Marriott had failed to protect personal data as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In some ways you can feel sorry for Marriott. In all the boardroom discussions about the company's takeover of Starwood, I bet it never realised that a hacker was already lurking inside the valuable databases they were buying. The cyber-criminals had been in the systems for years, and were effectively thrown into the merger deal without Marriott having a clue. Herein lies the issue, though - it seems the larger hotel didn't check what it was buying. The ICO report makes clear Marriott beefed up the security of Starwood's IT systems far too late and the hackers had free rein to move around, cherry-picking the data that would sell best on criminal forums. The fine is nothing like the Â£99m the ICO planned to issue, but it's still a massive deterrent for future companies. It may make executives planning their next big mergers look more carefully and cautiously at the databases they're about to acquire. ""Millions of people's data was affected by Marriott's failure,"" commissioner Elizabeth Denham said. ""Thousands contacted a helpline and others may have had to take action to protect their personal data because the company they trusted it with had not."" Different types of data were exposed for different guests, and some of the estimated 339 million may have represented duplicate records for repeat guests, making an exact count impossible. Despite imposing a fine, the ICO acknowledged that Marriott had acted quickly once it found the flaw, and had improved its systems since. In a statement, Marriott wrote that it ""deeply regrets the incident"". ""Marriott remains committed to the privacy and security of its guests' information and continues to make significant investments in security measures for its systems. ""The ICO recognises the steps taken by Marriott following discovery of the incident to promptly inform and protect the interests of its guests,"" it said.

"This video can not be played Powerful earthquake destroys buildings and causes flooding on Turkey's Aegean coast A powerful earthquake has struck off Turkey's Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos, destroying homes and killing at least 22 people. The 7.0 magnitude tremor was centred off Turkey's Izmir province, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. Turkey put the magnitude lower, at 6.6, saying 20 people had died and 786 were injured in the province of Izmir. On Samos, two teenagers were killed. The shallow tremor triggered a mini-tsunami that flooded Izmir and Samos. The authorities in Izmir, the provincial capital, are now setting up a tent area to house about 2,000 people overnight, amid fears that more buildings could collapse. The authorities said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Rescuers continued to dig through concrete blocks after darkness fell, hoping to find more survivors. The USGS said the quake - which was felt as far away as Athens and Istanbul - struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), although Turkish officials said it was 16km below ground. Turkey and Greece both sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Rescuers and local residents are frantically searching for survivors in Izmir The death toll could rise further as a number of people are feared trapped under the rubble in Izmir In Izmir, Turkey's third largest city with the population of nearly three million, many people were seen running out into the streets in panic and fear after the quake struck. At least 20 buildings collapsed. Videos have been posted on social media appearing to show the moment one multi-storey building went down, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Istanbul reports. Other footage shows local people scrambling over rubble looking for survivors. There were reports of flooding in the city after the sea level rose, and some fishermen are said to be missing. ""It was a really strong shaker almost enough to knock you off your feet. Running out of the house with my children was like a drunken wobble,"" Chris Bedford, a retired British teacher who lives in Urla, west of Izmir, told the BBC. This video can not be played Footage shows town on Greek island of Samos flooded by earthquake One of the 20 confirmed victims drowned, the Turkish emergencies agency said. Yasar Keles, an official in Sigacik, near Izmir, told BBC Turkish that a person died after their wheelchair was hit and overturned by the rising water. Officials later said that 70 people had been rescued from under the rubble. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government would help those affected by the quake ""with all the means available to our state"". On Samos, residents were urged to stay outdoors as aftershocks continued In Greece, two teenagers were killed when a wall collapsed on Samos. Eight people were injured across the island. A mini-tsunami flooded the port of Samos and a number of buildings were damaged. Greek officials put the magnitude of the tremor at 6.7. ""We felt it very strongly,"" local journalist Manos Stefanakis told the BBC, adding that smaller aftershocks were continuing. He said it was the biggest tremor to have hit the island since 1904. Fareid Atta, another Samos-based journalist, told the BBC that the damage was ""quite extensive along the seafront"" of the island's main town. ""Many businesses will be going under after this,"" he said. Residents were urged to stay outdoors and keep away from coastal areas. About 45,000 people live on Samos. Jude Wiggins, co-ordinator at women's centre for refugees in Samos The building began to shake in our centre so we ran out. Soon the roads began to flood. We were scared there would be a tsunami so we ran up the hill. About 45,000 people live on Samos I was in the kitchen. The washing machine was going and I thought it was just doing that thing when it shakes and moves around at first. But the fridge was moving. I ran out. Women were running everywhere. For a lot of the women it's quite traumatic as they've come from places like Syria and it could have felt like they were being bombed or something. At some point everybody started to run. People were panicking. Our house is not safe to stay in as there are a lot of cracks. For the people in the camps, they've lost everything in their own countries, they lost everything again in a fire and now lots of them have lost the tents they were sleeping in. Reports said Friday's quake was also felt on the Greek island of Crete. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he called Mr Erdogan ""to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries"". ""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,external,"" Mr Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet. Mr Erdogan later responded, also by posting a tweet. ""I offer my condolences to all of Greece on behalf of myself and the Turkish people,external,"" he wrote. ""Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" he added. Relations between Greece and Turkey have been particularly strained in recent months by a dispute relating to control of territorial waters in the Mediterranean and the resources beneath them. In Januarymore than 30 people were killed and more than 1,600 injuredwhen an earthquake struck Sivrice in Turkey's eastern Elazig province. In July 2019, the Greek capital Athens was hit by a tremor thatknocked out power to large parts of the city. A powerful quake that struck the Turkish city of Izmit, near Istanbul, in 1999 killed about 17,000 people. Are you in an area affected by the earthquake?

"Despite a damning report on the handling of anti-Semitism allegations, Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to 130 pages that describe how Labour let Jewish people down was achingly familiar. The former Labour leader stated his own anti-racist campaigning credentials, but then claimed that the prevalence of racism against Jewish people inside the party was overstated by those who wished him political harm. That defence was circulating online shortly after 10:30 GMT, not long before his successor Sir Keir Starmer took to his feet, to confront the findings of theEqualities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report,externalthat details a shaming episode for the party. Sir Keir's speech had already been written to include a vow that anyone who claimed the problem was exaggerated would have no place in the Labour Party. The leadership said it had not seen Mr Corbyn's statement in full at this stage. Labour suspends Corbyn over anti-Semitism reaction A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims It's understood Labour headquarters did then urge the former leader to retract his words, but when that didn't happen, the decision was taken by the party's general secretary, David Evans, that he would have to be suspended and an investigation launched. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I'll be appealing to the party, and those that have made this decision, to kindly think again"" Sir Keir was, it's understood, part of the discussion but not, his allies maintain, set on ousting Mr Corbyn. This seems not to have been a deliberately designed collision between the current party boss and his predecessor. But this was an explosive political parting of ways, provoked in part by Mr Corbyn's trademark determination not to bend. This is an attribute admired by many of Mr Corbyn's devotees, a frustration abhorred by his detractors and a sadness to those in Labour who believe it coloured the party's handling of anti-Semitism. For Sir Keir, today's episode does, perhaps by accident rather than design, prove beyond doubt his slogan - Labour is under new leadership - to be true. So much so that the former leader is not presently allowed in it. This video can not be played Keir Starmer ""disappointed"" with Corbyn's response But although Jeremy Corbyn's political project ultimately failed, for some on the left he remains a hero, much maligned. Mr Corbyn's forced exit once again exposes the divides in the party that Sir Keir promised to bring together. The scars from Labour's years of infighting are still fresh, and prone to tear. And the day when the party built on fighting for equal rights was found to have broken the law designed to guard those rights, is no moment of pride.

"This video can not be played Crowds gather in Nottingham ahead of new restrictions Nottinghamshire has moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates. Unlike some other tier three areas, betting shops, saunas, tattoo parlours and nail salons must close. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". The area, including the city of Nottingham, moves into the highest tierdays ahead of West Yorkshire. From Monday, it will take the total number of people living in very high restrictions to just over 11 million - 19.6% of the population. Latest updates as Nottinghamshire enters tier three Some business owners in Nottinghamshire have described the new rules as unfair and inconsistent. The county's director of public health Jonathan Gribbin said the infection rate in the over 60s had been ""rising significantly"" and was of ""grave concern"". On Wednesday, 413 people across the county were being treated in hospital for Covid-19, which is 40% more than the highest figures seen during the first wave of the virus. People were seen drinking alcohol in large groups in Nottingham on Thursday night On Thursday evening, young people took to the streets of Nottingham in fancy dress in advance of the rules coming into force. Youngsters were seen posing for photographs and chanting near police vehicles in Market Square. Nottinghamshire Police said one man was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. They also issued dispersal orders after officers were called to St James' Street because of people said to be gathering and not social distancing when they were leaving bars. Alison Challenger, Nottingham's director of public health, said she was ""really disappointed"" by the scenes. ""We've been working with colleagues and with stakeholders and with young people across the city and county to try and highlight the need for young people to also play their part,"" she said. St James' Street was empty on Friday morning after a night when police were called there because of the crowds Nottinghamshire County Council leader Kay Cutts previously said police had asked for the ban on buying alcohol after 21:00 to stop students partying. She said the county could follow tier three restrictions for 28 days, and appealed to people ""to crack down as hard as we can now"" so residents ""can have a more normal Christmas"". ""But it will depend entirely on the trajectory of the virus,"" she said. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Are we heading back into a full lockdown? North East at 'critical point' in virus fight Within the new rules in Nottinghamshire, indoor entertainment and tourism venues have to close but there are exceptions for ice-skating rinks, cinemas, concert halls and theatres. Joy Cotton, the director of Skateland UK, a family-run roller skating rink in Nottingham, said said she felt ""pretty sad"" about closing and thought there was ""inconsistency"" around the new rules. ""I've been in touch with the council and I don't seem to have an answer as to why ice skating can continue but roller skating can't,"" she said. Joy Cotton believes there is also an argument Skateland should remain open as a sports facility Lily Le, who has run Lily Nails in Mansfield for seven years, said it had been a ""surprise"" that the restrictions required nail salons to close. ""We don't have as many people as a pub. Why do we have to close?"" she said. ""It's horrible we be to shut down again, even the customers aren't happy."" Pete Green, the owner of the Taurus Tattoo Studio in Newark, said: ""I've just started building my clientele up and they've shut us down again. ""It's crippling, very unfair. I don't understand why they're picking on tattooists."" Lily Le, who runs Lily Nails, questioned why nail parlours had to close At The Castle Barge pub in Newark, Frank Dyson said it would have to shut for the 28 days of the new restrictions. ""We are not in a position where we can do substantial food. We could get along with tier two but tier three is totally out of the question,"" he said. James Aspell, the owner of the 400 Rabbits bar in Nottingham which will also have to close, said: ""We've worked really hard over the past few months to get all the recommendations in the government has asked us to do. ""Once again, we seem to being punished for the rise in cases."" Pete Green described the changes as ""crippling"" All areas of Nottinghamshire have seen a significant rise in infection rates, except for Nottingham. At one point the city had the highest infection rate in the country with 834.2 cases per 100,000 people, but this has now reduced to 436.2. Despite seeing a fall in new cases, Nottingham University Hospital Trust admitted more than 250 Covid-19 patients last week. The only hospital trust in England that had more admissions was in Liverpool. Initially only south Nottinghamshire was due to move into tier three, but the government expanded the area to the whole of the county earlier this week. Mr Gribbin added: ""Nottinghamshire's got rates which are rising really quickly, that's been driving a lot of the disruption we've been seeing in our hospitals."" Across all of the hospitals trusts that serve Nottinghamshire 64 people have died of Covid-19 in the seven days up to 25 October, a significant increase compared to 38 deaths the previous week.

Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

This video can not be played Covid: ""It's the worst two weeks of my life"" A man who refused to wear a face covering after believing false conspiracy theories about Covid-19 has said battling the virus was ""the worst two weeks"" of his life. Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving the Welsh Government's daily briefing He says there will be no more local lockdowns in Wales - only a nation-wide approach Workers on low incomes will receive a Â£500 payment if they are forced to self-isolate People will risk being fined if they deliberately mislead track and trace contact tracers Treasury says a claim by economy minister about the scale of Welsh Government's business support is ""nonsense"" Chatting was the biggest cause of rise in cases before current lockdown, Public Health Wales says Wales is due to come out of lockdown on 9 November James McCarthy and Matt Lloyd That's it from today's live page. Thank you for joining us for the developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. Our latest stories are: Here is a graph illustrating the number of coronavirus deaths over time. Another 11 people havedied with coronavirus in Wales, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales on Friday. Wales' first minister
has refused to comment on thesuspension of
former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mark Drakeford's stance comes after shadow Welsh secretary Nia Griffith said the move was ""absolutely right"". A report found Labour responsible for ""unlawful"" discrimination during Mr Corbyn's leadership. The former leader was suspended after saying the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been""dramatically overstated""by opponents. Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies said Mr Drakeford, one of Mr Corbyn's earliest supporters in 2015, ""needs to confirm whether he supports Sir Keir Starmer in suspending Corbyn or if he backs his political idol"". Another 11 people havedied with coronavirus in Wales, according to the latest figures. This means a total of 1,859 people have died since the start of the pandemic. A further 1,737 cases were reported in the latest Public Health Wales data, bringing the total number of cases to 49,571. Another 12,665 tests were carried out yesterday and, of the 734,891 people tested in total so far, 685,320 have tested negative.  We will find out on Monday whether we can leave our home county. The first minister said he is ""acutely aware"" of the impact of travel restrictions under the current lockdown. ""In some ways it is an unfair
restriction, because it has a different impact depending on the size of a local
authority you happen to live in,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""And the smaller the local authority,
the greater the impact that has on your life. So all of that is playing a very
important part in the thinking that we have been going through this week."" The First Minister says he is expecting to
meet with the UK government to discuss a ""common approach to
Christmas"". Mark Drakeford said he has received a letter
from Boris Johnson saying a meeting will
be arranged with cabinet office minister, Michael Gove. Mr Drakeford claimed his officials have tried to arrange that meeting
this week but ""it hasn't yet been forthcoming"". He added: ""We need to share ideas and, wherever we can, particularly around that Christmas period, I would like to see
as common an approach as we can craft together by recognising that the state
of the virus and the response that's being made, does differ from one part of
the UK to another."" An estimated 26,100 people in Wales had coronavirus in the most recent week, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). About 0.86% or one in 120 people were thought to have Covid-19 in the week up to 23 October, after analysis of thousands of swab results. This is 9,400 more than estimated the week before. Over a six-week period, ONS asked 14,719 people in Wales for nose or throat swabs. It tested the results and found 67 positive results, from 52 people from 40 households. From this infection survey, ONS makes its calculations, although it says data should be treated with caution.,external ""Our modelling suggests that the number of Covid-19 cases in Wales has increased in recent weeks,"" it said. The figures estimate one in 100 people in England had the virus in the same week, compared to one in 160 the week before, while it was one in 80 people in Northern Ireland - or 1.32%. Meanwhile, analysis of antibody blood tests in the community leads the ONS to estimate that 107,000 adults tested positive to Covid-19 in Wales in September - or one in 24 people - compared to 72,000 (one in 35) in August. This compares the estimated proportions of the population in the UK nations with Covid-19 Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to explain how new Wales-wide measures will stop Covid cases rising and leading to
another lockdown. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would announce on
Monday the new rules when the current âfirebreakâ ends on 9 November. Plaid leader Adam Price responded: âIf we are going to get it down, how are we going to keep it down? âWhat we need to
understand is some of the detail behind how are we coming out of this
firebreak, all the sacrifices everybody will have made over this period and how
are we going to keep the R number below one - because if it isnât below one, we will see the number of cases creeping back up. ""We havenât had that detail from the Welsh Government, the
scientific evidence about how this new set of national measures are going to
prevent a rising curve, and prevent us from being in exactly the same
position considering another lockdown in a few months.â A member of the Newport-based Dragons RFC's management staff has tested positive for Covid-19. The Welsh region's Pro14 game at home to Munster on Sunday will still go ahead as no players have been affected. However director of rugbyDean Ryan will not be at Rodney Paradeas he is one of the members of the wider management group required to self-isolate as a close contact. Dragons confirmed the individual who tested positive is asymptomatic and is self-isolating. Ministers will decide this weekend the level of fines
people will have to pay for giving false information to contact tracers. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new policy was
designed to stop people fraudulently claiming a new Â£500 payment aimed at those
on low incomes who are forced to self-isolate. Employers will also have a duty not to make staff work
if they have been told to self-isolate. âAs a result of these announcements it will be easier to do
the right thing here in Wales,â Mr Drakeford said. A national policy will replace any local lockdowns in Wales once the current ""firebreak"" is complete. The local lockdowns have helped but were not
sufficient to deal with the ""onslaught"" of the virus, the First
Minister has said. Mark Drakeford said while the localised approach was effective it ""didn't work well
enough"". He praised ""absolutely
worthwhile"" efforts made by the public but stressed ""efforts have
met a virus that has risen at a pace and on a scale"". From 9 Novembera Wales-wideapproach to tackling the virus will be introduced. Mr Drakeford said: ""Our decision is that the other side of the firebreak period from
the 9th of November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in
all parts of Wales, and I hope that that will help people in Wales, just to be
clearer about what they are being asked to do."" Plaid Cymru has critcised the Welsh Goverment's scheme to help businesses during the pandemic. The party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called it ""hugely disappointing"" after the Welsh Government said it was ""fully subscribed"". ""Was only open for a few hours,"" Mr ap Iorwerth wrote on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The process for businesses to access help during the
pandemic is âcomplexâ, the first minister has admitted. Mark Drakeford claims businesses ""understand"" why that
is the case and appreciate the Welsh Government support on offer. âWhen we make
schemes available in Wales, over and above the schemes available through the UK
government, that does add complexity,"" he told the daily briefing. âBut truthfully, it is a complexity that business
understands and welcomes because with that complexity comes Â£500m.â Mr Drakeford said there had been a âlarge responseâ to the
latest phase of the Welsh Governmentâs Economic Resilience Fund. How hospital admissions in Wales compare to the rest of the UK. Here's a reminder on the latest coronavirus statistics in the UK. As of Thursday, there have been another 23,065 positive cases and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. We're expecting new figures later on. About 100,000 people are catching coronavirus every day in England,according to new analysis from Imperial College London. Their study says the pace of the epidemic is increasing, and estimates that the number of new cases is doubling every nine days. Although hospital admissions for Covid-19remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities, with more than half of all hospital cases recorded in the north of England. Workers on low incomes will receive a Â£500 payment if they
are forced to self-isolate, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Social care workers will also receive a payment if they
are forced to self-isolate due to a positive test or on the advice of Test,
Trace and Protect (TTP). The Welsh Government has set aside Â£32m to fund the
payments, initiallyannounced by Mark Drakeford on 22 September. Workers will need to apply through their local authority and
the payment can be backdated from 23 October. Regulations will be strengthened, Mr Drakeford said, in
order to prevent fraudulent claims. The
Welsh Conservatives have criticised Ministers for first announcing the Â£500
payment a month ago, but failing to get the scheme up and running until
now. Similar projects in England and Scotland are already in place. People in Wales will be committing an offence if they knowingly give false details to contact tracers under new rules. First Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement on Friday. People in Wales need to self-isolate for ten to 14 days, depending on whether they or people in their household have symptoms. There have been claims contact tracers have sometimes been given false information. It
isnât yet clear what fines will be levied against those who break the new
contact tracing rules. Employers will be banned from preventing people from self-isolating, which itself will become a duty for individuals under the law. Wrexham's home National League game with Sutton United on Saturday has been postponed afterfive of their players tested positive for Covid-19. The decision was reached after talks between Dragons' Covid medical officer and the league's Covid medical officer. They recommended all players and staff who travelled by coach to Solihull Moors for last Saturday's FA Cup tie loss should now self-isolate. A Wrexham statement thanked Sutton United ""for their understanding"". The number of criminal cases yet to be dealt with by Crown Courts threatens tooverwhelm England and Wales',externaljustice system,external, a study suggests. A backlog in the courts hearing the most serious cases could be 195,000 by 2024 without action, says crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory. It says longer sittings and new courts are required to tackle the problem, which has worsened during the pandemic. The Ministry of Justice said the study was based on ""extreme assumptions"". Workers at one Wrexham business are to be given free turkeys instead of their traditional party and secret Santa. Customer service business Moneypenny is also offering nut-roasts or hams to staff. CEO Joanna Swash told BBC Radio Wales it was a way of thanking staff. She said: ""It's about keeping morale up, particularly when you've got a bit of a dispersed team at the moment."" Â© 2025 BBC.

There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow.

University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since.

Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).

"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party.

"This video can not be played Crowds gather in Nottingham ahead of new restrictions Nottinghamshire has moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates. Unlike some other tier three areas, betting shops, saunas, tattoo parlours and nail salons must close. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". The area, including the city of Nottingham, moves into the highest tierdays ahead of West Yorkshire. From Monday, it will take the total number of people living in very high restrictions to just over 11 million - 19.6% of the population. Latest updates as Nottinghamshire enters tier three Some business owners in Nottinghamshire have described the new rules as unfair and inconsistent. The county's director of public health Jonathan Gribbin said the infection rate in the over 60s had been ""rising significantly"" and was of ""grave concern"". On Wednesday, 413 people across the county were being treated in hospital for Covid-19, which is 40% more than the highest figures seen during the first wave of the virus. People were seen drinking alcohol in large groups in Nottingham on Thursday night On Thursday evening, young people took to the streets of Nottingham in fancy dress in advance of the rules coming into force. Youngsters were seen posing for photographs and chanting near police vehicles in Market Square. Nottinghamshire Police said one man was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. They also issued dispersal orders after officers were called to St James' Street because of people said to be gathering and not social distancing when they were leaving bars. Alison Challenger, Nottingham's director of public health, said she was ""really disappointed"" by the scenes. ""We've been working with colleagues and with stakeholders and with young people across the city and county to try and highlight the need for young people to also play their part,"" she said. St James' Street was empty on Friday morning after a night when police were called there because of the crowds Nottinghamshire County Council leader Kay Cutts previously said police had asked for the ban on buying alcohol after 21:00 to stop students partying. She said the county could follow tier three restrictions for 28 days, and appealed to people ""to crack down as hard as we can now"" so residents ""can have a more normal Christmas"". ""But it will depend entirely on the trajectory of the virus,"" she said. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Are we heading back into a full lockdown? North East at 'critical point' in virus fight Within the new rules in Nottinghamshire, indoor entertainment and tourism venues have to close but there are exceptions for ice-skating rinks, cinemas, concert halls and theatres. Joy Cotton, the director of Skateland UK, a family-run roller skating rink in Nottingham, said said she felt ""pretty sad"" about closing and thought there was ""inconsistency"" around the new rules. ""I've been in touch with the council and I don't seem to have an answer as to why ice skating can continue but roller skating can't,"" she said. Joy Cotton believes there is also an argument Skateland should remain open as a sports facility Lily Le, who has run Lily Nails in Mansfield for seven years, said it had been a ""surprise"" that the restrictions required nail salons to close. ""We don't have as many people as a pub. Why do we have to close?"" she said. ""It's horrible we be to shut down again, even the customers aren't happy."" Pete Green, the owner of the Taurus Tattoo Studio in Newark, said: ""I've just started building my clientele up and they've shut us down again. ""It's crippling, very unfair. I don't understand why they're picking on tattooists."" Lily Le, who runs Lily Nails, questioned why nail parlours had to close At The Castle Barge pub in Newark, Frank Dyson said it would have to shut for the 28 days of the new restrictions. ""We are not in a position where we can do substantial food. We could get along with tier two but tier three is totally out of the question,"" he said. James Aspell, the owner of the 400 Rabbits bar in Nottingham which will also have to close, said: ""We've worked really hard over the past few months to get all the recommendations in the government has asked us to do. ""Once again, we seem to being punished for the rise in cases."" Pete Green described the changes as ""crippling"" All areas of Nottinghamshire have seen a significant rise in infection rates, except for Nottingham. At one point the city had the highest infection rate in the country with 834.2 cases per 100,000 people, but this has now reduced to 436.2. Despite seeing a fall in new cases, Nottingham University Hospital Trust admitted more than 250 Covid-19 patients last week. The only hospital trust in England that had more admissions was in Liverpool. Initially only south Nottinghamshire was due to move into tier three, but the government expanded the area to the whole of the county earlier this week. Mr Gribbin added: ""Nottinghamshire's got rates which are rising really quickly, that's been driving a lot of the disruption we've been seeing in our hospitals."" Across all of the hospitals trusts that serve Nottinghamshire 64 people have died of Covid-19 in the seven days up to 25 October, a significant increase compared to 38 deaths the previous week.

"An estimated 570,000 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics Cases of Covid-19 appear to be levelling off in the North East of England, the ONS data shows Covid is spreading ""significantly"" faster through England than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, Sage documents reveal UK's latest daily figures show 24,405 further positive cases and 274 more deaths as of Friday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends localised measures - he says the government is ""striving to avoid"" a ""blanket approach"" The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, Welsh first minister says Senior pupils will have to wear masks in class in areas under tighter restrictions in Scotland Nottinghamshire has now moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates West Yorkshire will move into tier three measures from Monday Edited by Sarah Collerton We are now closing our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us. Sarah Collerton was today's live page editor and the writers were Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Doug Faulkner and Cherry Wilson. We are winding down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere. Cinema is one of the highest-profile sectors to be suffering as a result of the pandemic, with delays to the release of blockbusters such as James Bond film No Time To Die and the temporary closure of the Cineworld chain. But it has presented opportunities to independent film-makers like Guy Davies, whose debut feature, Philophobia, is due to be screened at 50 cinemas across the UK. This video can not be played Film-maker Guy Davies spots gap in film distribution market for his first feature Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There's no stopping the second wave of coronavirus, it seems, despite a bundle of new rules designed to do just that. Infection rates are rising rapidly, with estimates suggesting up to100,000 people a day may be catching the virus. Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"The two candidates - President Donald Trump and Joe Biden - head to the Midwest, another key battleground Some 84 million people have already voted ahead of election day on 3 November The country is on course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century Edited by Boer Deng Thanks for joining our live rolling coverage of the presidential as the countdown to election day on Tuesday continues. In today's developments:  We'll be back tomorrow with more campaign coverage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen to its lowest level since coronavirus lockdowns were implemented in March. A falling stock market in the final days of Trump's first term, is sure to sting the president, who often points to high stock prices as evidence of his accomplishments on managing the US economy, as our North America Editor Jon Sopel points out.

With just four days until election day, Biden has a solid lead nationally in opinion polls. But his advantage looks less assured in the battleground states, such as Florida and Wisconsin. Those states, which were won by Trump in 2016, will likely decide who ultimately wins the White House. Read more: Who is leading - Trump or Biden? Berlin's Madame Tussauds wax museum has moved their sculpture of Trump to the skip in anticipation of next's week's election. ""Dump Trump Make America Great Again,"" says an accompanying sign on the display, which has been placed by the museum's entrance. The US president is surrounded by bags of rubbish and cardboard cutouts of his tweets. Other US presidents, including Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan are positioned around him, outside of the dumpster. Tussaud's marketing manager Orkide Yalcindag told Reuters: âTodayâs activity is rather of a symbolic character ahead of the elections in the United States... We here at Madame Tussauds Berlin removed Donald Trumpâs waxwork as a preparatory measure.â Last month at New York's Madame Tussauds location, employees placed a face mask on the US president, to remind visitors to wear masks. Trump was just speaking in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""We win this state â you know what â itâs all over,"" the president said, referencing Wisconsin's importance as a battleground that could go either way. Trump also tells his supporters that this election is far more important than 2016, accusing Democrats of having gone too far left. ""If I don't sound like a typical politician it's because I'm not,"" Trump added. Wisconsin is currently seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases. The governor has warned of an impending crisis as hospitals are filling up. Earlier, Green Bay hospitals issued a statement warning that the president's Friday rally couldworsen the situation. However, Trump backers are still turning up at rallies and he has the support of at least one famous fan. Brett Favre, a former (and very famous) quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, the city's professional American football team, endorsed the president. While the US is seeing record early voting figures for next week's election, you may be surprised that it trails other developed countries when it comes to voter turnout. Historically, turnout in the US has hovered around 50% since the 1970s. The turnouts at the last general elections in India and France both beat that. Young people from these three nations tell us about their experiences of learning to vote, and whether it's stressed to them as a civic duty. This video can not be played US election: 'How we learn about voting in India, France and US' A Republican congressman in Georgia who held a pro-Trump rally on Tuesday while Joe Biden was visiting the state has tested positive for Covid-19. Representative Drew Ferguson said in a statement that he began to feel ill on Wednesday night and that, after consulting with his doctor, he decided to self-isolate at home. Governor Brian Kemp, who also co-hosted the rally, said on Friday that he too would be self-isolating after being exposed over the previous 48 hours to someone who had been infected. Kemp and his wife both tested negative on Friday, his office said in a statement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may think waiting 11 hours to vote would be the height of frustration, but not for one family in Georgia. ""We made it, y'all,"" says Johnta Austin in one viral video filmed as they reach the front of the queue, describing the lengthy process as an ""honour"". There are similar stories across the US. But globally, people have been wondering why on earth it takes so long to cast a vote. A British man wrote: ""Dear USA, I'm 58 and not once in my life have I had to queue to vote. Sort it out!"" One man in India pointed out that his country handles more election ballots than any other democracy in the world, and no such long queues have been seen in previous elections. Read the full story here. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Lindsay Stewart, 37, from Aberdeen, UK, asks:Is the electoral college system still fit for purpose today or does it unfairly skew the result? As it stands now, the more populous states (like California and Texas) are more underrepresented by the college than the lower population states, which some people say is not fair because it gives states where fewer people live more electoral power. All but two states say it's winner-takes-all for their electoral votes, so whoever gets the most votes gets all the electoral college votes too, whether that's a difference of one vote or one thousand. In 2016, this is how Trump was able to win big hitters in the electoral college like Florida and Wisconsin, even though his popular vote margin was slim. Essentially, this means much of the battle for the White House takes place in a handful of competitive states that could swing either way. (To get a better sense of this, try ourpredict the president battleground states game. It's fun, promise.) For decades, there's been a steady amount of support among the public to nix this system, according to the Pew Research Center. Right now, around 58% want to ditch it - but notably, attitudes have grown increasingly partisan since 2016, with more Republicans saying they support the system just as it is. One suggestion floated to fix this dissonance between the electoral college and popular vote is to award electors proportionally instead. But any changes to this voting system will need signing off from both two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states - which is nearly impossible.

Presidential candidates are campaigning hard in the US Midwest today - but curiously, so are Republican senators. A number of them have been flooding Iowa in recent days. We've spotted Iowa senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, as well as Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. âThe Democrats have gone bat crap crazy,"" Cruz said at the event in Sioux City. ""That, by the way, is a technical medical definition. They are galloping to the left."" The non-Iowan Republicans are in the Hawkeye States ostensibly to campaign for Trump - but some close political-watchers wonder if it could also be a sign that they are eyeing their chances of taking on the party mantle once he is out of office - whether after this election or the next one.  Tom Cotton's travel schedule seems to betray his presidential ambitions Iowa, along with New Hampshire, are two of the earliest states to hold primary elections, which are the contests where party candidates are determined before the general election. Senator Cotton, who seems to have obvious presidential ambitions, has been coming and going from Iowa and New Hampshire frequently in the past few months. You might remember him as the senator who described slavery as a ""necessary evil"" in a New York Times op-ed this summer. Trump spoke for over an hour in Michigan, wrapping up his first of three rallies for the day. Next up are rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and then Rochester, Minnesota. Biden delivered remarks in Des Moines, Iowa. Later today, he'll be at a drive-in rally in St Paul, Minnesota, and will give a speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. With only four days to go until election day, vote-counting starts, the candidates are both eager to stick to their established messages. Don't expect either of them to waiver too far from their scripts in the final days of the 2020 race. Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. James D Clark is an âold school Republicanâ who cast his vote for a Democrat for the first time. He graduated from Oxford University and is a tax lawyer who lives in Fairfax, Virginia.We featured him in our story about voters reacting to Donald Trumpâs tax returns. Despite his Republican past he âwould never dream of voting for Trump"" he says. He mailed his absentee ballot in for Joe Biden in September. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Experts tell me theyâre worried that false claims
about fraud and the supposed unreliability of mail-in voting could undermine
faith in the US election result. Our Reality Check team looked into the claims.They found that numerous national and state-level studies have shown that there have been isolated cases, but in general, voting fraud is extremely rare. That hasnât stopped President Trump and his supporters
from suggesting that they might not trust the result. On more than 70 occasions, the president has tweeted messages that cast doubt on or criticised mail-in
voting, mentioned voter fraud or referenced âriggedâ elections, according to an
analysis by BBC Monitoring Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center, a think tank, told me weâre in uncharted waters. âVoters will think - can I really trust that my vote
will be counted?â she says. âThatâs unprecedented in the United States.
Everyone has always trusted the democratic process.â How can you spot false claims about voting on your social media feeds before polling day? Here are some tips. Biden's now on stage in Iowa, speaking to an audience in their cars. So far he's jabbed at Trump calling himself a ""stable genius"", criticised his pandemic response and drawn attention to the Trump administration's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, the public health care scheme popularly known as Obamacare. Biden says he'll protect healthcare, restore the healthy economy that Trump ""squandered"", and take the pandemic seriously. ""Honk if you want America to be united again!"" Biden says, to a slew of, you guessed it, honks. ""This is a great crowd. We have a lot of great crowds,"" says Trump at the top of his remarks in Waterford Township, Michigan. Trump tells the supporters who turned up despite the near-freezing temperatures that they now ""are famous"" for having come to his rally. He repeats his oft-delivered attacks against Bidenâs running mate Kamala Harris. ""Crazy Bernie is like a conservative compared to her,â he says - a reference to democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders - in an effort to cast Harris, a former prosecutor, as a radical leftist. Itâs important to pronounce her name âexactly rightâ, he says, otherwise sheâll get upset. Confusingly, he also says that Harris herself is unable to correctly pronounce her own name. Spotting Fox News Host Laura Ingraham in the crowd, he points out that sheâs wearing a mask and says it because she is being âpolitically correctâ. Housing Secretary Ben Carson was also in the audience Some nuns, such as these Dominican Sisters of Hartland, Michigan, have made surprising appearances at Trump rallies Some 'politically correct' Trump supporters in Michigan A district attorney in the battleground state of Pennsylvania has warned that prison time may be in store for those engaged in a particular kind of election hi-jinx: uncertified poll watching. ""Iâve got a jail cell, and Iâve got criminal charges and you can stand in front of a Philadelphia jury - which, by the way, is a diverse jury - and you can explain why you thought it was OK to come to Philly and steal our votes,â Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner told CNN. ""Wannabe fascists stay home, and if your idea of how to have a democratic election is to steal it, then Iâve got something for you,"" Krasner, a Democrat, added. Poll watchers, as the name suggests, are people keeping an eye out for fraud and are usually a normal aspect of US elections. Usually, they are appointed by campaigns or campaign groups, and their names reported to officials ahead of time to be properly designated. This year, a row over the role has come up after Trump told his supporters to go to the polls and watch out for ""voting fraud"". The president has also repeatedly suggested he will only lose his re-election bid if there is widespread fraud. Democrats have responded by accusing Trump and his followers of trying to intimidate voters. Early voters in Philadelphia Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. Taylor Golden, 35, is a small business owner from Houston, Texas. She was not very interested in politics until Trump came along. She has already cast an early vote for the president. To show her enthusiasm for his re-election, she joined a Trump boat parade in Galveston, Texas. It was âa cold and dreary day, and the water was incredibly choppy,â but hundreds of boats joined. âEveryone was in high spirits and you could feel the love and pride in the air,â she said. âBeing surrounded with such patriotism is an honour."" Actor Noah Centineo is voting for the first time this year in a US election. The 24-year-old's organisation Favored Nations has also created a pop-up venue in Los Angeles, to encourage Gen Z and millennials to vote. More young people are expected to vote in the 2020 race than in previous elections. Historically, the US youth turn-out has been low compared to other age groups. Centineo told BBC World News America he hadnât voted before âout of protestâ. But now, he says, things have changed: This video can not be played US election: Why Noah Centineo is voting for the first time The Trump campaign has announced plans to host a rally on Election Day-eve in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Also of note on his Monday agenda is a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where massive protests took place earlier this summer after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. It's also where a white teenager allegedly shot and killed two protesters. Trump is rounding out the 2020 season with a final rally in the same city he held his last rally in 2016: Grand Rapids, Michigan. Here's what the president's schedule on Monday is looking like: Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Macnos Mutano, 32, from Sydney, Australia asks:Why can the electoral college override the popular vote? We've received thousands of questions from all of you, and the most common query is about the electoral college. This controversial part of the US election system is a source of confusion here too. When voters go to the polls, they aren't directly voting for the candidates. They're voting for ""electors"" - people who represent their candidate's party. The number of electors each state gets depends on how many lawmakers it has in Congress - and remember, House of Representatives seats are population-based, while every state gets two Senators. California has 55 electoral college votes whereas Wyoming only has three, and it all adds up to a total of 538 electors. So, in this system, not all states are created equal. It is getting the 270 electoral college votes that is needed to win the White House, not the popular vote, giving rise to presidents who may not be the most popular.

"An estimated 570,000 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics Cases of Covid-19 appear to be levelling off in the North East of England, the ONS data shows Covid is spreading ""significantly"" faster through England than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, Sage documents reveal UK's latest daily figures show 24,405 further positive cases and 274 more deaths as of Friday UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends localised measures - he says the government is ""striving to avoid"" a ""blanket approach"" The UK government intends to hold a meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, Welsh first minister says Senior pupils will have to wear masks in class in areas under tighter restrictions in Scotland Nottinghamshire has now moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions after an overall rise in infection rates West Yorkshire will move into tier three measures from Monday Edited by Sarah Collerton We are now closing our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us. Sarah Collerton was today's live page editor and the writers were Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Doug Faulkner and Cherry Wilson. We are winding down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Here's a final roundup of the main headlines this Friday evening: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News You donât need to be a genius to realise how difficult managing the virus through winter is going to be. Scientists advising government have been arguing for a short, planned lockdown - called a circuit-breaker -since 21 September. They made the case when there were around 5,000 confirmed cases a day. The numbers have changed dramatically since then and their argument is intensifying not lessening. The UK government is holding to its regional ""tiered"" system even as other countries introduce new lockdowns. There areglimmers of hope with cases appearing to level offin the north east and the R number drifting down. However, the national R rate is not below 1.0 and there will be a constant argument for tighter restrictions, in whatever form, until it is. The biggest thing to remember is quite how much further we have to go - November, December, January and February are expected to be the toughest months - and we are in this for the long haul. There have been nearly one million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 45,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. The government announced 24,405 confirmed cases on Friday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August: The government announced 274 further deaths on Friday. Of those deaths, 226 were in England, 28 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. And here is how the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - compares across the UK. The current estimate of the R number for the UK isbetween 1.1 and 1.3,external, so infections continue to grow. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent A major update to the NHS Covid-19 app should mean it's better at identifying people who have been in contact with someone infected with the virus and should also send out more alerts. But the way the app is designed, using privacy tools made by Apple and Google, means it is difficult to know what effect it is having. That's led some people to suggest the balance between privacy and effectiveness is wrong. The team behind the app will have details of how many positive tests have been registered and how many self-isolate alerts have been sent - but not the identities of the individuals or where and by whom they may have been infected. Tom Loosemore, who helped found the Government Digital Service, said ""they're flying blind"" and being denied ""the meat and drink of contact tracing"". University College London academic Michael Veale said the NHS team had gone further than needed in protecting privacy. He suggested users could have been asked for a phone number which could be called when they needed to isolate. ""That's fine from a privacy point of view,"" he said. Instead, app users just see an alert - and can choose whether to obey it. Read more from Roryhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics There are good reasons to think infections have plateaued in north-east England. The number of people testing positive each day has been stable in the North East for a few weeks. Testing figures can be misled by ebbs and flows in the demand for tests or bottlenecks in the system. But two big studies point to the same pattern: data from theReact-1 study reported yesterdayand todayâs figures from theOffice for National Statistics. Both studies pick people to test at random. They catch infections in people who might never have come forward for a test. And they say the same thing. However, the clouds on the silver lining are that plateauing at a high level is not the same as starting to come down. And, in every other nation and region of the UK, infections are still rising. The US sawa record high of 91,000 new Covid-19 casesreported on Thursday, with spikes in dozens of states just days before the presidential election. The same day, over 1,000 Americans died with the virus, as the national death toll and number of patients in hospital continue to trend upward. The US is just shy of nine million total cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. Arizona has been hit particularly hard, with nearly 6,000 deaths and the number of cases rising every day. The BBC's Clive Myrie visited one of its worst affected communities - the Navajo nation: This video can not be played 'This pandemic is instant death' We have more on the news thatSage documents warn the Covid-19 situation in Englandis worse than the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario. University of Warwick scientist Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage sub-group SPI-M which produced the report, said: ""There's still some uncertainty, the worst-case scenario does climb quite dramatically in November and December and there's been a lot of policy changes in the last couple of weeks. ""It may be that we see the trajectory come down a bit."" However, he said that the highest - tier three - restrictions are unlikely to bring the R number below 1.0 and that ""we might need to take more action on a national scale"". That is not part of the government's current strategy, which is focused on local restrictions to control the virus. As we told you earlier, the R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - for the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3, which means the virus is continuing to spread. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Covid isspreading ""significantly"" faster through Englandthan the government's predicted ""worst-case"" scenario, documents reveal. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says there are around four times as many people catching Covid-19 than anticipated. A ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", used by officials and the NHS to plan, hadestimated 85,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the course of winter. But an official Sage document,dated 14 October,externaland published on Friday, estimated that, by mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 people being infected with coronavirus every day in England. Their report said: ""This is significantly above the profile of the reasonable worst-case scenario, where the number of daily infections in England remained between 12,000-13,000 throughout October."" It added that the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is already higher than the winter plan and deaths will ""almost certainly"" exceed the plan in the next two weeks. However, this is not the same as saying more than 85,000 people will die this winter as government action can still change the course of the pandemic. If cases fall in the ""very near future"" then the higher than anticipated deaths ""might only continue for three to four weeks"", the report said. Another 24,405 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while a further 274 deaths have been recorded, according to thelatest government figures,external. It takes the overall number of cases in the UK to 989,745, while the total death toll has reached 46,229. The alarm was raised at University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride shortly before 22:00 A Covid-19 intensive care unit in a Scottish hospitalhad to be evacuated after a fire broke out. Three firefighting crews were sent to University Hospital Hairmyres in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said. The Covid unit was one of three wards cleared after the blaze started on ward one, where 13 patients were being treated for the virus. The fire was extinguished and three casualties were assessed by staff. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a tweet that her thoughts were with everyone caught up in the ""frightening incident"" and thanked staff for their efforts in ensuring the safety of the patients. Russell Coulthard, the hospital's site director, praised the ""magnificent"" response after the alarm was raised on the first floor intensive care unit at about 21:45 GMT on Thursday. He said no patients had been transferred off the hospital site, but the fire would mean that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals. The UK government plans to hold a meetingto discuss a UK-wide approach to Covid rules at Christmas, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him to expect an invitation to talks on a ""common approach"". The first minister said there was a need for leaders to ""get round the table"" and ""share ideas"" but added that despite efforts to secure the meeting this week it ""hasn't yet been forthcoming"". Earlier this week, Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was ""too early to say"" what the rules will be and warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"". It came after the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland called fora ""four-nations summit"" to agree a shared plan. Scotland's national clinical director haswarned people to prepare for a digital Christmasand some people are already making plans for a very different Christmas celebration.

Instead of attending traditional remembrance services and parades, people in Scotland are being encouraged to mark the days at home People in Scotland are being urgedto observe the upcoming annual remembrance days from home, after events at local war memorials were cancelled due to the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Services will take place in Edinburgh on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day but will not be open to the public. Instead of attending services and parades, Scottish residents are being encouraged to hold a two-minute silence on their doorstep. Thousands of households across the UKapplauded the NHS on their doorsteps during lockdown. Outdoor standing events are not permitted,externalin areas under Covid levels one, two and three in Scotland. Dr Claire Armstrong, of Legion Scotland, said: ""Coronavirus must not cancel remembrance, but public safety is paramount. ""However, we can and must take time as a nation to observe the two-minute silence safely."" The BBC will broadcast a remembrance service at the Cenotaph in London on 8 November. There will beno local lockdowns in Walesafter the end of the country's 17-day firebreak, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Bars, non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes and churches will reopen at the end of the current lockdown on 9 November. Wales saw 17 local lockdowns before the introduction of the firebreak and Drakeford confirmed these would not return. ""For the sake of clarity and simplicity, our decision is is that the other side of the firebreak period from 9 November, we will have a set of national rules that will apply in all parts of Wales,"" he said. He also warned that a ban on people travelling to Wales from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus could continue after the firebreak ends, adding that a decision would be made in the next couple of weeks. He said: ""The point of asking people in those places not to travel into Wales was because the rate of virus circulation in those places was so much more than it is here and I'm afraid there is still a significant gap between those places and Wales."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The furlough scheme has undoubtedly delivered on its principle aim - to prevent mass unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic shutdowns. The technical task at HMRC alone of turning around the funding for wages for nine million jobs should not be underestimated. It has been expensive, obviously. The final bill will be in line with the annual cost of the UK defence budget around Â£50bn. Nine in 10 of those furloughed remained on payrolls. The wider point of the scheme was to maintain the contractual employment relationship for millions of jobs, through the shutdowns. The borrowing will be repaid over a very long period of time. It won't mean immediate tax rises. But it will mean over a decade or more, some higher taxes and lower spending than would otherwise have been the case. The real test of the need for the furlough scheme, was the fact that when the chancellor tried to wind it down, it has, basically, been half-kept at least until the spring, under the guise of the Job Support Scheme.

Trevor Jones from Bolton, in north west England, said he initially believed others who told him coronavirus was ""man flu"" orlinked to the 5G network, but became gravely ill after testing positive in September. He received critical care in hospital and said he ""lost a stone and a half in 12 days"". He said his experience had changed his perspective on the virus and how seriously it should be taken. Kathleen Cantell, 73, was transferred from a hospital in Norfolk to a care home in Darlington in September A woman has described her anger after her elderly mother contracted coronavirus after being moved to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Kay Cantell said her mother Kathleen, 73, was transferred from Norfolk to Darlington in September. Kathleen, who has bi-polar disorder, was a patient at Northgate Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, when she was sent to a care home in Cromer, less than 40 miles (64km) away. However, on 23 September, her daughter Kay received a call saying the stay was not working out but that no beds were available back at Northgate Hospital. The caller said Kathleen was instead being transferred to a private hospital near Darlington, 240 miles (386km) away. ""She was on her way as I got the phone call. We didn't have time to say goodbye to her,"" said Kay. Kathleen's family has not been able to see her since. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has apologised for not informing Kay of her mother's move sooner. You can read the full storyhere.

Across the Channel, France has admitted its regional approach is not working, by announcing a new national lockdown. Germany, to a lesser extent, is also planning one. Wales is in the middle of a short ""fire-breaker"" lockdown, in which bars, restaurants, churches and most shops have shut for a fortnight. So is a full-on UK-wide lockdown only a matter of time? Read the full story here. The reproduction rate - or R number - remains above one across the UK, meaning that the virus is continuing to spread exponentially. Thelatest government figures,externalput the R number at 1.1 to 1.3, which means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. Last week the R number was 1.2 to 1.4. There is a growth rate of between +2% and +4% which means the number of new infections is growing by 2% to 4% every day. Last week this was between +4% and +7%. The numbers are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Sage said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.

"The number of criminal cases waiting to be dealt with by Crown Courts threatens to overwhelm the justice system in England and Wales, a study suggests. A backlog in the courts hearing the most serious cases could be 195,000 by 2024 without action, says crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory. It says longer sittings and new courts are needed to tackle the problem, which has worsened during the Covid pandemic. The Ministry of Justice said the study was based on ""extreme assumptions"". The authors of the study say it is a reasonable worst case scenario but there is a ""catastrophic risk to public confidence, and effective enforcement of the law"". Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Weeds, leaks, and four-year waits for justice Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Judge makes formal complaint over custody waits There can already be gaps of up to four years between an alleged offence and a criminal trial - placing the lives of defendants, victims and witnesses in limbo. The backlog of cases was increasing long before Covid and now stands at about 45,500. Crest looked at how this could develop over the next four years. It took into account: The long term impact of Covid-19 on unemployment, which could see a rise in some crime Plans to recruit 20,000 additional police officers A rise in police recorded crime based on historical trends The current time frames for cases at court ""The conclusion of our modelling is stark,"" Crest said. ""Covid 19, combined with long-standing legacy issues and the police uplift is leading the criminal justice system to the brink of a tipping point, beyond which it may cease to function in a meaningful sense."" The human cost can be measured in part by defendants held on remand in prison for longer. Peter - not his real name - is the father of a young man charged, along with five others, with drugs offences. His son has been waiting more than a year for his trial. ""He's locked up for 23-and-a-half-hours - he's frustrated, we're frustrated,"" Peter said. ""My daughter in law already has lost a child due to this because of the amount of stress she's going through. She had a premature birth... a still birth. ""Just putting somebody away and forgetting about them, and delaying it over and over again, how frustrating is that for a person mentally?"" Peter's son has no guarantee of a trial date. Trials involving several defendants are a problem during the pandemic because of social distancing requirements. There are around 120 trials with seven or more defendants - including gang murders and major drugs conspiracies - that are too big be currently accommodated in the courts, according to estimates by the Criminal Bar Association. The government has also extended custody time limits (CTLs) - the length of time a defendant can be held before their trial - from six to eight months. That and fewer trials make it unsurprising thatprison service figures released on Wednesday,externalshow the remand population - those in prison awaiting trial, and between trial and sentencing - has increased by 28% in the past year to 12,274 and is at the highest level for about six years. The extension of CTLs has become highly controversial, withone judge claiming he had been put under improper pressureto keep a defendant in prison. There are also anecdotal reports of defendants pleading guilty to get out of prison - with some fearing they will serve longer on remand than would be imposed if they were convicted. The Crest study says court capacity needs to be doubled to stabilise the case backlog. As well as longer sitting hours and new buildings, it suggests a greater use of existing courts and technology, and more part-time judges. However, Crest says increasing court capacity would have knock on effects on other parts of the criminal justice system, such as prisons. And a projected increase in suspended sentences would put pressure on an already-struggling probation service. Jo Sidhu QC, vice chair of the Criminal Bar Association, says Crest is ""simply telling us what we already know"". He said: ""If no further action is taken to address these problems immediately by massively increasing the number of courtrooms to hear these cases, you are looking at... years of waiting for justice to be done."" The government promised that 250 out of 490 crown courtrooms will be trial ready by the end of October. It also established 16 new Nightingale courts - although they only offer eight dedicated criminal trial courtrooms. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the Crest study's assumptions ""do not stand up to reasonable scrutiny - such as vast rises in crime and charging which have no clear rationale"". They added: ""They also fail to take account of our extensive efforts to limit the impact of the pandemic on the justice system. ""As a result of these, magistrates' court backlogs are already falling, Crown Courts are listing more jury trials every week, and we're spending Â£80m on a range of measures to further drive this recovery, including the recruitment of 1,600 additional staff.""

"For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The furlough scheme was the centrepiece ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's ""unprecedented"" interventionin the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus. It protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. Now that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go. During the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially. That doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time. According todata from HM Revenue & Customs,external(HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown. Since then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC. ""To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,"" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020. Although he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdroppinga Â£30bn package to boost the economyand get the country through the virus outbreak. But it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month. Under the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves Overall it cost the government nearly Â£70bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a ""great success"", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment. While workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough. Younger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail. Since March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme. Some sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others. With pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed. And non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash. People working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life. The scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. However over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end. In recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen. The Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as ""a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention"". But its recent research,externalsuggested there remained a ""real risk"" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers. And doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme. It has drawn fire fromthe Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency. The committee has spoken dismissively of ""hastily drawn up economic support schemes"" that provided ""unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers"". HMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. Apart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities. The number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors. Some have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers.

"The two candidates - President Donald Trump and Joe Biden - head to the Midwest, another key battleground Some 84 million people have already voted ahead of election day on 3 November The country is on course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century Edited by Boer Deng Thanks for joining our live rolling coverage of the presidential as the countdown to election day on Tuesday continues. In today's developments:  We'll be back tomorrow with more campaign coverage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen to its lowest level since coronavirus lockdowns were implemented in March. A falling stock market in the final days of Trump's first term, is sure to sting the president, who often points to high stock prices as evidence of his accomplishments on managing the US economy, as our North America Editor Jon Sopel points out.

With just four days until election day, Biden has a solid lead nationally in opinion polls. But his advantage looks less assured in the battleground states, such as Florida and Wisconsin. Those states, which were won by Trump in 2016, will likely decide who ultimately wins the White House. Read more: Who is leading - Trump or Biden? Berlin's Madame Tussauds wax museum has moved their sculpture of Trump to the skip in anticipation of next's week's election. ""Dump Trump Make America Great Again,"" says an accompanying sign on the display, which has been placed by the museum's entrance. The US president is surrounded by bags of rubbish and cardboard cutouts of his tweets. Other US presidents, including Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan are positioned around him, outside of the dumpster. Tussaud's marketing manager Orkide Yalcindag told Reuters: âTodayâs activity is rather of a symbolic character ahead of the elections in the United States... We here at Madame Tussauds Berlin removed Donald Trumpâs waxwork as a preparatory measure.â Last month at New York's Madame Tussauds location, employees placed a face mask on the US president, to remind visitors to wear masks. Trump was just speaking in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""We win this state â you know what â itâs all over,"" the president said, referencing Wisconsin's importance as a battleground that could go either way. Trump also tells his supporters that this election is far more important than 2016, accusing Democrats of having gone too far left. ""If I don't sound like a typical politician it's because I'm not,"" Trump added. Wisconsin is currently seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases. The governor has warned of an impending crisis as hospitals are filling up. Earlier, Green Bay hospitals issued a statement warning that the president's Friday rally couldworsen the situation. However, Trump backers are still turning up at rallies and he has the support of at least one famous fan. Brett Favre, a former (and very famous) quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, the city's professional American football team, endorsed the president. While the US is seeing record early voting figures for next week's election, you may be surprised that it trails other developed countries when it comes to voter turnout. Historically, turnout in the US has hovered around 50% since the 1970s. The turnouts at the last general elections in India and France both beat that. Young people from these three nations tell us about their experiences of learning to vote, and whether it's stressed to them as a civic duty. This video can not be played US election: 'How we learn about voting in India, France and US' A Republican congressman in Georgia who held a pro-Trump rally on Tuesday while Joe Biden was visiting the state has tested positive for Covid-19. Representative Drew Ferguson said in a statement that he began to feel ill on Wednesday night and that, after consulting with his doctor, he decided to self-isolate at home. Governor Brian Kemp, who also co-hosted the rally, said on Friday that he too would be self-isolating after being exposed over the previous 48 hours to someone who had been infected. Kemp and his wife both tested negative on Friday, his office said in a statement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may think waiting 11 hours to vote would be the height of frustration, but not for one family in Georgia. ""We made it, y'all,"" says Johnta Austin in one viral video filmed as they reach the front of the queue, describing the lengthy process as an ""honour"". There are similar stories across the US. But globally, people have been wondering why on earth it takes so long to cast a vote. A British man wrote: ""Dear USA, I'm 58 and not once in my life have I had to queue to vote. Sort it out!"" One man in India pointed out that his country handles more election ballots than any other democracy in the world, and no such long queues have been seen in previous elections. Read the full story here. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Lindsay Stewart, 37, from Aberdeen, UK, asks:Is the electoral college system still fit for purpose today or does it unfairly skew the result? As it stands now, the more populous states (like California and Texas) are more underrepresented by the college than the lower population states, which some people say is not fair because it gives states where fewer people live more electoral power. All but two states say it's winner-takes-all for their electoral votes, so whoever gets the most votes gets all the electoral college votes too, whether that's a difference of one vote or one thousand. In 2016, this is how Trump was able to win big hitters in the electoral college like Florida and Wisconsin, even though his popular vote margin was slim. Essentially, this means much of the battle for the White House takes place in a handful of competitive states that could swing either way. (To get a better sense of this, try ourpredict the president battleground states game. It's fun, promise.) For decades, there's been a steady amount of support among the public to nix this system, according to the Pew Research Center. Right now, around 58% want to ditch it - but notably, attitudes have grown increasingly partisan since 2016, with more Republicans saying they support the system just as it is. One suggestion floated to fix this dissonance between the electoral college and popular vote is to award electors proportionally instead. But any changes to this voting system will need signing off from both two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states - which is nearly impossible.

Presidential candidates are campaigning hard in the US Midwest today - but curiously, so are Republican senators. A number of them have been flooding Iowa in recent days. We've spotted Iowa senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, as well as Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. âThe Democrats have gone bat crap crazy,"" Cruz said at the event in Sioux City. ""That, by the way, is a technical medical definition. They are galloping to the left."" The non-Iowan Republicans are in the Hawkeye States ostensibly to campaign for Trump - but some close political-watchers wonder if it could also be a sign that they are eyeing their chances of taking on the party mantle once he is out of office - whether after this election or the next one.  Tom Cotton's travel schedule seems to betray his presidential ambitions Iowa, along with New Hampshire, are two of the earliest states to hold primary elections, which are the contests where party candidates are determined before the general election. Senator Cotton, who seems to have obvious presidential ambitions, has been coming and going from Iowa and New Hampshire frequently in the past few months. You might remember him as the senator who described slavery as a ""necessary evil"" in a New York Times op-ed this summer. Trump spoke for over an hour in Michigan, wrapping up his first of three rallies for the day. Next up are rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and then Rochester, Minnesota. Biden delivered remarks in Des Moines, Iowa. Later today, he'll be at a drive-in rally in St Paul, Minnesota, and will give a speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. With only four days to go until election day, vote-counting starts, the candidates are both eager to stick to their established messages. Don't expect either of them to waiver too far from their scripts in the final days of the 2020 race. Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. James D Clark is an âold school Republicanâ who cast his vote for a Democrat for the first time. He graduated from Oxford University and is a tax lawyer who lives in Fairfax, Virginia.We featured him in our story about voters reacting to Donald Trumpâs tax returns. Despite his Republican past he âwould never dream of voting for Trump"" he says. He mailed his absentee ballot in for Joe Biden in September. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Experts tell me theyâre worried that false claims
about fraud and the supposed unreliability of mail-in voting could undermine
faith in the US election result. Our Reality Check team looked into the claims.They found that numerous national and state-level studies have shown that there have been isolated cases, but in general, voting fraud is extremely rare. That hasnât stopped President Trump and his supporters
from suggesting that they might not trust the result. On more than 70 occasions, the president has tweeted messages that cast doubt on or criticised mail-in
voting, mentioned voter fraud or referenced âriggedâ elections, according to an
analysis by BBC Monitoring Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center, a think tank, told me weâre in uncharted waters. âVoters will think - can I really trust that my vote
will be counted?â she says. âThatâs unprecedented in the United States.
Everyone has always trusted the democratic process.â How can you spot false claims about voting on your social media feeds before polling day? Here are some tips. Biden's now on stage in Iowa, speaking to an audience in their cars. So far he's jabbed at Trump calling himself a ""stable genius"", criticised his pandemic response and drawn attention to the Trump administration's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, the public health care scheme popularly known as Obamacare. Biden says he'll protect healthcare, restore the healthy economy that Trump ""squandered"", and take the pandemic seriously. ""Honk if you want America to be united again!"" Biden says, to a slew of, you guessed it, honks. ""This is a great crowd. We have a lot of great crowds,"" says Trump at the top of his remarks in Waterford Township, Michigan. Trump tells the supporters who turned up despite the near-freezing temperatures that they now ""are famous"" for having come to his rally. He repeats his oft-delivered attacks against Bidenâs running mate Kamala Harris. ""Crazy Bernie is like a conservative compared to her,â he says - a reference to democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders - in an effort to cast Harris, a former prosecutor, as a radical leftist. Itâs important to pronounce her name âexactly rightâ, he says, otherwise sheâll get upset. Confusingly, he also says that Harris herself is unable to correctly pronounce her own name. Spotting Fox News Host Laura Ingraham in the crowd, he points out that sheâs wearing a mask and says it because she is being âpolitically correctâ. Housing Secretary Ben Carson was also in the audience Some nuns, such as these Dominican Sisters of Hartland, Michigan, have made surprising appearances at Trump rallies Some 'politically correct' Trump supporters in Michigan A district attorney in the battleground state of Pennsylvania has warned that prison time may be in store for those engaged in a particular kind of election hi-jinx: uncertified poll watching. ""Iâve got a jail cell, and Iâve got criminal charges and you can stand in front of a Philadelphia jury - which, by the way, is a diverse jury - and you can explain why you thought it was OK to come to Philly and steal our votes,â Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner told CNN. ""Wannabe fascists stay home, and if your idea of how to have a democratic election is to steal it, then Iâve got something for you,"" Krasner, a Democrat, added. Poll watchers, as the name suggests, are people keeping an eye out for fraud and are usually a normal aspect of US elections. Usually, they are appointed by campaigns or campaign groups, and their names reported to officials ahead of time to be properly designated. This year, a row over the role has come up after Trump told his supporters to go to the polls and watch out for ""voting fraud"". The president has also repeatedly suggested he will only lose his re-election bid if there is widespread fraud. Democrats have responded by accusing Trump and his followers of trying to intimidate voters. Early voters in Philadelphia Members of our voter panel have been sharing their voting experiences with us. Taylor Golden, 35, is a small business owner from Houston, Texas. She was not very interested in politics until Trump came along. She has already cast an early vote for the president. To show her enthusiasm for his re-election, she joined a Trump boat parade in Galveston, Texas. It was âa cold and dreary day, and the water was incredibly choppy,â but hundreds of boats joined. âEveryone was in high spirits and you could feel the love and pride in the air,â she said. âBeing surrounded with such patriotism is an honour."" Actor Noah Centineo is voting for the first time this year in a US election. The 24-year-old's organisation Favored Nations has also created a pop-up venue in Los Angeles, to encourage Gen Z and millennials to vote. More young people are expected to vote in the 2020 race than in previous elections. Historically, the US youth turn-out has been low compared to other age groups. Centineo told BBC World News America he hadnât voted before âout of protestâ. But now, he says, things have changed: This video can not be played US election: Why Noah Centineo is voting for the first time The Trump campaign has announced plans to host a rally on Election Day-eve in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Also of note on his Monday agenda is a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where massive protests took place earlier this summer after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. It's also where a white teenager allegedly shot and killed two protesters. Trump is rounding out the 2020 season with a final rally in the same city he held his last rally in 2016: Grand Rapids, Michigan. Here's what the president's schedule on Monday is looking like: Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Macnos Mutano, 32, from Sydney, Australia asks:Why can the electoral college override the popular vote? We've received thousands of questions from all of you, and the most common query is about the electoral college. This controversial part of the US election system is a source of confusion here too. When voters go to the polls, they aren't directly voting for the candidates. They're voting for ""electors"" - people who represent their candidate's party. The number of electors each state gets depends on how many lawmakers it has in Congress - and remember, House of Representatives seats are population-based, while every state gets two Senators. California has 55 electoral college votes whereas Wyoming only has three, and it all adds up to a total of 538 electors. So, in this system, not all states are created equal. It is getting the 270 electoral college votes that is needed to win the White House, not the popular vote, giving rise to presidents who may not be the most popular.

"Despite a damning report on the handling of anti-Semitism allegations, Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to 130 pages that describe how Labour let Jewish people down was achingly familiar. The former Labour leader stated his own anti-racist campaigning credentials, but then claimed that the prevalence of racism against Jewish people inside the party was overstated by those who wished him political harm. That defence was circulating online shortly after 10:30 GMT, not long before his successor Sir Keir Starmer took to his feet, to confront the findings of theEqualities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report,externalthat details a shaming episode for the party. Sir Keir's speech had already been written to include a vow that anyone who claimed the problem was exaggerated would have no place in the Labour Party. The leadership said it had not seen Mr Corbyn's statement in full at this stage. Labour suspends Corbyn over anti-Semitism reaction A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims It's understood Labour headquarters did then urge the former leader to retract his words, but when that didn't happen, the decision was taken by the party's general secretary, David Evans, that he would have to be suspended and an investigation launched. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I'll be appealing to the party, and those that have made this decision, to kindly think again"" Sir Keir was, it's understood, part of the discussion but not, his allies maintain, set on ousting Mr Corbyn. This seems not to have been a deliberately designed collision between the current party boss and his predecessor. But this was an explosive political parting of ways, provoked in part by Mr Corbyn's trademark determination not to bend. This is an attribute admired by many of Mr Corbyn's devotees, a frustration abhorred by his detractors and a sadness to those in Labour who believe it coloured the party's handling of anti-Semitism. For Sir Keir, today's episode does, perhaps by accident rather than design, prove beyond doubt his slogan - Labour is under new leadership - to be true. So much so that the former leader is not presently allowed in it. This video can not be played Keir Starmer ""disappointed"" with Corbyn's response But although Jeremy Corbyn's political project ultimately failed, for some on the left he remains a hero, much maligned. Mr Corbyn's forced exit once again exposes the divides in the party that Sir Keir promised to bring together. The scars from Labour's years of infighting are still fresh, and prone to tear. And the day when the party built on fighting for equal rights was found to have broken the law designed to guard those rights, is no moment of pride.

"The whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday Nottinghamshire is expected to receive Â£23.1m in funding to support businesses and manage Covid-19 enforcement as it enters tier three restrictions. The funding will see a Â£16.5m business support scheme for firms in the county and Â£6.6m for managing systems like NHS test and trace locally. The figure excludes Nottingham city, which will receive its own funding. The news comes as the whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday. Under Nottinghamshire's tier three restrictions, alcohol cannot be sold after 9pm in shops, but can be sold until 10pm if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Leader of the county council Kay Cutts said the curfew on selling alcohol was requested by Nottinghamshire Police in a bid to curb drinking in parks and streets after hospitality venues close. Unlike other tier three areas across the country, businesses such as betting shops, saunas, tattoo parlours and nail salons must also close. Ashfield District Council leader Jason Zadrozny said businesses would have to wait ""at least a week"" before receiving any financial support because of delays from central government. He said: ""People and businesses are frustrated and worried, a week doesn't sound that bad but take it in the context of these businesses. ""The wolf's already at the door, they're already existing. ""I went to a food bank that didn't exist at the start of this and now they're doing 200 food parcels a week, in one ward of Ashfield, that's the level of deprivation we're dealing with here."" At the beginning of the week it was thought only south Nottinghamshire would be entering tier three restrictions, but a surge in infection rates across the county led the government to re-evaluate its local lockdown. Nottinghamshire's director of public health Jonathan Gribbin said the infection rate in the over 60s had been ""rising significantly"" and was of ""grave concern"". ""These infections are leading to the most severe pressures in our care system and also our local NHS,"" he said. Nottinghamshire to have 9pm alcohol rule What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Nottingham's tier 3 restrictions 'heartbreaking' On Wednesday, 413 people across the county were being treated in hospital for Covid-19, which is 40% more than the highest figures seen during the first wave of the virus. Mr Gribbin added: ""Nottinghamshire's got rates which are rising really quickly, that's been driving a lot of the disruption we've been seeing in our hospitals."" He said Nottingham's two main hospitals, City and the Queen's Medical Centre, had admitted 49 patients in a single day. Ms Cutts said the hope was the county could follow tier three restrictions for 28 days, and appealed to people ""to crack down as hard as we can now"" so Nottinghamshire ""can have a more normal Christmas"". ""But it will depend entirely on the trajectory of the virus"" she said. Mr Gribbin added the 28 days gave ""Nottinghamshire the very best chance of turning things around so that in the four weeks running up to Christmas we hope to be in a better place"". Paul Green fears he may not reopen after being told he will have to close under tier three restrictions Paul Green has run the Monster Shop - a tattoo parlour in Mansfield - for the past 36 years. The father-of-three said that during the national lockdown the financial help was insufficient, meaning he eventually had to take universal credit. He fears that if the tier three restrictions last as long as the lockdown did he may not reopen. ""We got a day and a half's notice, you can't prepare in that timescale,"" he said. ""We've abided by the rules, we're one of the cleanest businesses in the country, but they've still shut us down. ""Our customers can just drive a couple of minutes to tattoo places in Derbyshire.

"Nottinghamshire's auction houses, car boot sales, betting shops, saunas and tattoo parlours must close, the government has announced. The measures were revealed as it was confirmed the whole county would move into tier three at 00:01 on Friday. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Hotels can remain open, as can gyms and leisure centres. Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowehad been expected to move into the top tier of Covid restrictions on Thursday. While the tier three status has been delayed for 24 hours, it will now include the entire county. Other tier three rules include: Fitness and dance studios, sports courts and swimming pools can also remain open, although it is ""strongly advised"" group indoor classes do not take place Public buildings such as community centres, libraries and town halls are allowed to remain open to run activities such as childcare and support groups, but not for private hire, birthday parties and other social events ""Indoor entertainment and tourism venues"" have to close, but cinemas, concert halls, ice rinks and theatres are not affected by the new rules. Local lockdown rules: What Covid tier is my area in? Covid: How the new rules will work Housing Minister Christopher Pincher praised the local authorities ""for entering into productive discussions and coming to an agreement as quickly as possible"". ""We are very conscious that these new restrictions will have a huge impact on those living and working in the county, but this action is vital and is based on public health advice,"" he said. However, Nottingham South Labour MP Lilian Greenwood has criticised the government for taking ""a week and a half"" to come to an agreement over the city and county. ""It's created huge anxiety and uncertainty, by doing that I think they're undermining trust,"" she said. Micropubs like A Room with a Brew that cannot offer a ""substantial meal"" alongside pints for regulars will have to close A Room with a Brew, a micropub in Derby Road, Nottingham, lies between the city centre and the Lenton area popular with students. With no option to provide the crucial ""substantial meal"" to keep the beer flowing, licence-holder Jill Nettleton said the last week has been ""confusing"". ""Because we were expecting to close down last week we've let stocks run down, and now we've found out we can open tomorrow, which is a bit annoying"" she said. ""Why have they shut bars when nearly everything else is open?"" Jill Nettleton said not knowing if or when pubs would have to close meant buying less stock The rules on pubs in particular were a source of contention amid convivial conversation. ""I think the over-riding thing is people are genuinely confused as to why having a food option is a distinction,"" said one bemused regular. However, as often happens down the pub, a potential solution was suggested. ""Potentially you could nominate your local and just go to one place, or a small number,"" said Katy Voisey. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome also said she was not happy with the way information had been shared with local officials. ""The communication has been shoddy,"" she said. ""It's been so disrespectful. They've just treated the people of Nottingham with a total lack of respect."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, the MP for Newark, has defended the government's handling of local lockdowns. ""I'm certain I haven't got everything right, neither has the government, but we're learning as we know more about the virus and trying to take the right decisions,"" he said.

Nottingham had thehighest figures in the UKearlier this month, but its seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 23rd highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 451.5, in the week to 25 October - down from 611 the previous week. Mansfield's seven-day infection rate is currently at 349.5 cases per 100,000 people. Mansfield's Conservative MP Ben Bradley, who previously opposed his constituency moving into tier three, said ""big rises in cases in the north of the county"" meant it was hard to argue with the tightening of restrictions. ""The more and more those figures are similar - and we've seen Mansfield is pretty much the same as Broxtowe in terms of numbers - it's becoming increasingly difficult to make that case and treat it differently,"" he said. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Nottingham's tier 3 restrictions 'heartbreaking' 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be Hospital bosses in Nottingham have cancelled some cancer operations due to ""pressure on intensive care units"". Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust medical director Keith Girling said the trust had taken the ""extremely difficult decision"" to postpone four cancer operations this week. More than eight million people in England will be living in the tier three ""very high"" alert level by the end of the week. Nottinghamshire will join the Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. Pubs in tier three that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Business is booming for America's tech giants. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google reported sales and profits figures on Thursday covering the three months to 30 September - and there was a common thread: growth shows no sign of slowing. The cardboard boxes and delivery trucks were an early sign - and now we've got more proof: Amazon continues to be one of the biggest winners from the pandemic. Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total. The rise was driven by its e-commerce business in North America, as families increasingly turned to online shopping. But the company's advertising and cloud computing business also saw significant gains. The growth has not come without cost. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses and its reputation has also taken a hit, with protests against the firm's working conditions and other policies. Facebook, owner of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported a whopping 2.5 billion daily users on average in September across its platforms. That's up 15% from September a year ago - but only a 3% rise from June, when people stuck-at-home turned to social media, generating a flood of activity. The company warned that the number of Facebook users even declined in the US and Canada - its most profitable market - and told investors they expected the trend to continue. Twitter reported a similar story, claiming 187 million daily active users in the July-September quarter, up just 1 million from the prior period. Amid the shutdowns earlier this year, many businesses cut advertising spending. The move led sales to slow at Facebook and pushed Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to its first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue since becoming a publicly-listed company in 2004. But spending from those businesses has returned. At Google, revenue was up 14% year-on-year - far better than analysts had expected. The rise helped profits jump an eye-popping 59% year-on-year to more than $11bn, sending the firm's shares up more than 6% in after-hours trading. Twitter also saw revenue rise 14%, while at Facebook it jumped 22% and the firm said it expected that growth to accelerate. Apple sales hit $64.7bn, up slightly from a year ago - handily beating most analyst expectations, as sales of laptops and iPads surged. But shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading anyway, as investors digested a more than 20% drop in iPhone revenue. The hit was especially evident in Apple's Greater China region - where it typically generates about 20% of its sales and sales dropped almost 30%. Apple expressed confidence that buyers were simply holding out for its latest phone, which went on sale later than in prior years. ""Despite the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, Apple is in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever, and the early response to all our new products, led by our first 5G-enabled iPhone line-up, has been tremendously positive,"" chief executive Tim Cook said. As is typical, discussions from the companies focused on sales and profits - and not the controversies swirling around them as calls for tougher regulation gain traction in the US and elsewhere. In its prepared comments, Facebook stood out with its brief nod to the issue, warning of ""headwindsâ¦ from the evolving regulatory landscape"". But the companies' financial success will only make them more of a target for complaints, warned Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. ""Tech dominance will continue to raise eyebrows given the antitrust concerns,"" he said. ""There will be further calls from rivals to regulate tech companies."" Tech chiefs face tough questions over internet law US tech giants accused of 'monopoly power' California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Concerns were raised about a surge in infections and the economic impact on the region. West Yorkshire is to be placed under tier three Covid restrictions from Monday, the strictest level of rules. The area - home to an estimated 2.3 million people - includes the cities of Leeds and Bradford. The government has promised a further financial package of more than Â£59.3m for the region. Casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales will be shut, as well as pubs and bars not serving substantial meals. Under the tier three - very high alert - rules, there can also be no mixing of households indoors or outdoors, including in private gardens. It comes asa major study of Covid-19 in Englandsuggested that Yorkshire and the Humber, where one in every 37 people has the virus and includes West Yorkshire, is the country's worst affected area, followed by the North West region. When West Yorkshire goes into tier three from 00:01 GMT on 2 November, 11 million people - nearly a fifth of all those living in England - will be under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Tighter Covid restrictions for millions in England Sturgeon unveils Scotland's Covid alert levels Nearly 100,000 catching virus every day - study A statement from the Leaders of West Yorkshire Councils said they accepted the move into tier three ""with great reluctance"". ""The virus spread is now at a critical juncture. Not only are infections rising in our region, particularly amongst the elderly, but we already have evidence that the NHS is starting to struggle to deliver essential elective care,"" it continued. Bradford currently has the highest Covid rates in the county, with 483.5 cases per 100,000 of the population in the week to 24 October. Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of Bradford council and chair of the West Yorkshire combined authority, warned that ""further economic restrictions"" would be ""damaging"" for businesses and jobs. She accused the government of ""seriously underestimating the economic impact"" of restrictions and vowed that local leaders would ""challenge"" it to ""improve upon them"". This video can not be played The BBC's Fergus Walsh spoke to two volunteers who are taking part in the trial Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said Leeds hospitals had ""exceeded the peak position we were in earlier this year in April"". Hospitals in the city are currently treating 268 patients with Covid - up from 158 last week. The neighbouring areas of South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Lancashire are already under tier three restrictions, as well as the Liverpool City Region and Warrington.Nottinghamshire goes into tier three from Friday. The government's financial package is in addition to the business grant arrangements previously announced by the Chancellor when the area was place under tier two rules. Council leaders said the package could be broken down into two per-head figures: A one-off additional amount of Â£20 per head: for West Yorkshire - estimated to be worth Â£46.6m in additional funding A total of Â£8 per head to support enhanced test and trace and contain measures, resulting in an additional Â£12.7m They said they had been promised further conversations with government ministers to discuss local schemes ""to build on and continue to support the economic recovery of the region"". West Yorkshire is made up of five council areas - Calderdale, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield. Residents are advised to avoid travelling outside the area, unless for essential journeys, such as work or caring responsibilities. Gyms may continue to open, but the guidance is against indoor exercise classes taking place. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Victoria Eaton, Director of Public Health for Leeds, said the rate of infection in Leeds was ""still growing in Leeds though not as steeply as the increase in other areas, both in West Yorkshire and in Yorkshire and Humber"". She said the latest daily rate was 416.7 per 100,000. The rate of infection is now highest among 30-44 year olds but ""most worryingly we are seeing increases among our over 65 age group, which as we know is an early warning of future hospital admissions"". Judith Blake, Leeds City Council leader, said: ""This is obviously a very difficult decision for anyone to take. We realise the significance of the economic impact that this will have but we're very mindful of the fact the virus is at a state where we need to take measures, particularly with regard to our hospital admissions."" In other key developments: The UK reported another 23,065 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955 Nearly 100,000 people are catching coronavirus every day in England, with the number of positive cases doubling every nine days, the React-1 study by Imperial College London suggests Millions more people in areas of Yorkshire and the Humber, parts of the West and East Midlands, as well as Luton and Oxford Citywill move to tier two restrictions from Saturday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier unveiledScotland's new five-tier Covid measures, which will come into force from 06:00 on Monday of next week, but has not ruled out another national lockdown The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus in Wales continues to increase- up nearly a quarter on last week.

"This video can not be played Delia Smith calls for fans' return to stadiums Celebrity chef Delia Smith has written to the prime minister urging him to allow football fans back into stadiums. The Norwich City director warned that smaller clubs could be at risk of closure unless supporters were able to watch live games again soon. In an open letter, she said having distanced spectators was a ""far better option than six round a table inside"". The government has set up a taskforce to look at how fans might return to stadiums. Plans to reopen higher-level football grounds to supporters were postponed by the government in September amid rising Covid-19 cases. Delia is asking Boris Johnson to make a speedy decision on an agreed number of fans to be allowed into grounds to watch games. She proposes temperature checks before entry, seating people two metres apart, hand sanitising and the wearing of masks. The celebrity chef and Norwich City director believes smaller clubs are at risk of closure Her letter,published on Norwich City's website,external, said: ""Looking ahead to the possibility and consequences of smaller clubs ceasing to exist, we need to remind ourselves that football is one of the last bastions of what it means to be a community in contemporary life. ""Clubs at the heart of communities are saving the government and the taxpayer some of the high costs of youth crime. PS: Let me know if ever you want tickets to a game."" It is not the first time Delia has made a fan-related plea: in 2005, she famously took to the Carrow Road turf at half-time to urge Canaries supporters to turn up the volume, during what was a trying Premier League campaign. ""A message to the best supporters in the world,"" she said. ""We need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let's be having you! Come on!"" Delia Smith is joint majority shareholder at Norwich City Several clubs, including Norwich, have allowed a limited number of supporters towatch matches on TV screens in the hospitality areasof their grounds. Social-distancing guidelines for hospitality venues, relevant to what tier they are in, must be observed and fans are blocked from having a direct view of the pitch. Vue cinemas have also been screening Premier League matches, including the recent Merseyside derby. David Ross, chairman of the taskforce set up by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ""We know how crucial sport is to the social fabric of our communities, as well as the local businesses who rely on it. ""This group of experts will do all it can to come up with solutions that can help bring back live sport for the millions of fans who are missing it as much as we do.""

"This video can not be played Dijon Joseph was handcuffed and forcibly searched after police saw him fist bump his brother Liam Two innocent brothers wrongly suspected of drug dealing after being seen ""fist bumping"" have begun legal proceedings against the Metropolitan Police. Liam and Dijon Joseph were detained by officers in Deptford, south-east London, who suspected they had exchanged drugs while touching fists. A video of the incident was shared widely on social media. The brothers, who are black, say they believe they were targeted because of the colour of their skin. Lawyers for the pair say they have sued the Met for discrimination, assault and false imprisonment. Previously, thebrothers told the BBC that one officer restrained Liam, while a second rifled his pockets and - despite finding nothing illegal - took his keys and searched his car. Dijon said: ""It just seemed like a typical case of profiling. ""I felt demonised, I felt penalised, I felt criminalised. It's not just our own perceptions, it's the perception of our community."" On Tuesday theIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) published 11 recommendations from a review into stop-and-searches in London- all of which were accepted by the Met. The brother's lawyer Carolynn Gallwey said the IOPC had been investigating the motives of the officers who stopped them but found there was ""not enough evidence to say it was discrimination"". A statement added: ""After the IOPC complaint failed we approached the Equality & Human Rights Commission for help in bringing a case - they refused. ""We asked the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [Dame Cressida Dick] to admit discrimination under the Equality Act and they too refused. ""Having exhausted all other options we have today started civil proceedings at court against the Metropolitan Police for  discrimination, assault and false imprisonment. ""It remains our hope in doing so that the police and all the systems surrounding them will learn from our experience; change is past due.""
