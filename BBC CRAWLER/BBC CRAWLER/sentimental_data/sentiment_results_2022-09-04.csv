"Liz Truss has said it is fair to give higher earners more money back through tax cuts, saying recent Tory policy has failed to grow the economy. The Tory leadership hopeful has pledged to reverse a National Insurance rise. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the cut would be a gain of Â£7.66 for households on the lowest incomes, but those on the highest incomes could gain more than Â£1,800. Ms Truss said higher earners paid more tax, so would gain more from cuts. ""Of course, there are some people who don't pay tax at all,"" she told the BBC. ""But to look at everything through the lens of redistribution I believe is wrong because what I'm about is about growing the economy and growing the economy benefits everybody."" Truss vows energy plan in a week if she becomes PM What cost-of-living payments will I get? Ms Truss, who is the favourite to win against rival Rishi Sunak according to pollsters, said the economic debate over the past 20 years had been dominated by the issue of distribution of income. However, speaking onSunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: ""What's happened is we have had relatively low growth so we've had not more than an average of 1% growth and that has been holding our country back."" She said ""it is fair"" to give higher earners more money back through tax cuts. But Mr Sunak, speaking on the same programme, said it was right to ""focus the most help on the most vulnerable"". Both candidates for Tory leader - and prime minister - are under pressure to announce measures to help households with the soaring cost of energy that has contributed to high levels of inflation. Ms Truss haspromised she will ""act immediately""and announce a plan to deal with soaring energy costs within a week if she becomes prime minister on Tuesday. However she decline to give any details. Earlier in her campaign to succeed Boris Johnson, Ms Trusstold the Financial Times,externalshe rejected ""handouts"" as a means of helping people cope with the rising cost of living. Mr Sunak said he would target further energy payments at pensioners and the low-paid, beyond those he announced as chancellor. Liz Truss unapologetically embraced the message that her planned flagship National Insurance cut would benefit the richest to the tune of Â£1,000 or more, and the poorest barely. The answer we have become used to on such issues would be that this is only one part of a wider package. But Ms Truss was making the point that she will not judge the success of a particular tax policy on whether it immediately benefits poorer households. Over the past 20 years or so, most Budgets have been accompanied by an analysis of the winners or losers, by income brackets. Judging such moves in this way would inevitably show many tax cuts in a bad light. In the case of an NI cut, that is because the very poorest do not pay and the richest will benefit across all their earned income. Ms Truss says she wants to judge the appropriateness of such moves in other ways - such as whether they promote growth, investment and jobs. In this specific case, the NI rise also broke a manifesto pledge, which is another reason she judges it as ""fair"" to reverse it. The challenge for her, should she win, is that the impact of a move such as this can be compared very quickly to the acute difficulties facing many millions of households. When households that on average have for decades spent roughly Â£1,000 a year on energy, then move to Â£3,500 and then Â£4,000 or Â£5,000, it is presentationally challenging to prioritise a tax cut that generates that amount of saving only for the richest 10% of the country. Her supporters will argue her energy plan will come first, this week, before the wider economic plan including NI. But if her energy plan comes up short for some average households, she will be under pressure to explain why she is effectively keeping back tens of billions for lower NI and cancelling a corporation tax rise. National Insurance contributions rose by 1.25% in April to fund the NHS and social care. From next year, the extra tax will be rebranded as the Health and Social Care Levy. The increase meant that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270 and 2% on anything above that level, it has increased to 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. In July, the government raised the threshold on payments meaning employees can now earn Â£12,570 a year before paying National Insurance, up from Â£9,880 a year previously. Stuart Adam, senior economist at the IFS, told the BBC: ""Tax cuts can help to stimulate economic growth but that would still leave two questions. ""One is, what Liz Truss would do in the short run to help households, given that tax cuts go mainly to the better off who aren't going to struggle the most. ""The second question is how you would pay for tax cuts, because while tax cuts can increase the growth of the economy, they don't do that by so much that the tax cuts pay for themselves."" Ms Truss also reiterated her plan not to go ahead with a rise in corporation tax on businesses which she said would be ""completely self-defeating"". Mr Sunak, in his former role as chancellor, had announced the main tax rate for companies would rise from 19% to 25%. She said: ""What I know is that putting up tax on business is not going to attract more businesses to invest in this country."" Ms Truss had suggested she might review the Bank of England's mandate. However, speaking to the BBC, she said she was a ""great believer in the independence of the Bank of England"". ""I think it was about three decades ago we stopped politicians making decisions about interest rates, so I'm not going to start saying what interest rates the Bank of England should be setting.""

"This video can not be played Liz Truss promises to act immediately on bills and energy supply Liz Truss has promised to announce a plan to deal with soaring energy costs within a week if she becomes prime minister on Tuesday. The Tory leadership hopeful, the favourite according to pollsters, told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she would ""act immediately"" to help with bills. But she offered no details, saying she would need time in office first in order to finalise exact proposals. Her rival Rishi Sunak said he would target further payments at the poorest. One of the two contenders will be announced as the next Tory leader on Monday, and will replace Boris Johnson in Downing Street the next day. They have come under pressure to spell out how they would protect households with rising bills, as well as give help to businesses, which are not covered by thedomestic price cap. Chris Mason: New PM needs to unify divided Tory party Recap: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak quizzed by Laura Kuenssberg I will support next Tory government, says Sunak It's fair to give wealthiest more money back - Truss Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Foreign Secretary Ms Truss said action on energy bills would be ""vital"" for people and the economy. She added that further support would need to go ""hand in hand"" with a plan to boost domestic energy supplies, arguing the UK had become too dependent on international energy prices. Mr Sunak said further energy payments, beyond those heannounced as chancellor, should be targeted at pensioners and the low-paid. He has argued his suggested cut to VAT on energy bills would also provide some help for all. He also said he couldn't rule out the prospect of blackouts over the winter to ration supplies, as the situation was ""serious"" and ""every tool in the toolbox"" would be needed. ""Of course we don't want to be in that situation, but I think it's responsible not to rule it out,"" he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says he can't solve the issue around energy bills for everyone Ms Truss has promised to deliver around Â£30bn in tax cuts in an emergency Budget later this month if she wins, including a reversal of April's rise to National Insurance. How is the new Tory leader chosen? What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? Claims on solar panels and the economy fact-checked Pressed on whether richer people would benefit more from the cut, she said: ""The people at the top of the income distribution pay more tax - so inevitably, when you cut taxes you tend to benefit people who are more likely to pay tax."" But she added: ""To look at everything through the lens of redistribution I believe is wrong. Because what I'm about is growing the economy - and growing the economy benefits everybody. ""The economic debate for the past 20 years has been dominated by discussions about distribution. And what's happened is we've had relatively low growth"". Beyond his proposed cut to VAT on energy bills, Mr Sunak has taken a different approach, arguing permanent tax cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Labour's shadow attorney-general Emily Thornberry said it was ""extraordinary"" neither candidate had given a ""specific answer"" about their energy plans during the weeks-long leadership race. She added that people were ""desperate"" for help, and those on middle incomes as well as the poorest would struggle with rising bills. Her party, along with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, wants to freeze energy bills by paying energy companies to sell gas and electricity below market rates this winter. The Lib Dems have said they will table a bill in Parliament next week on their plan - which will not be voted on, but could offer more detail of their proposals. Ms Truss declined to say whether she might implement a price freeze, saying it would be wrong for her to give details of her plan before she is appointed. Speaking to Sky News, SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Ms Truss to ""cancel"" further energy rises and give ""substantial"" support to business. Mr Johnson's successor will be announced at 12:30 BST on Monday, before taking office on Tuesday after being formally appointed by the Queen. In a break with tradition, the winner willtravel to Balmoral Castle in Scotlandfor the ceremony, rather than Buckingham Palace. The Queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements.

"Mr Scholz (second left) announced the measures flanked by coalition allies Germany has announced a â¬65bn (Â£56.2bn) package of measures to ease the threat of rising energy costs, as Europe struggles with scarce supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The package, much bigger than two previous ones, will include one-off payments to the most vulnerable and tax breaks to energy-intensive businesses. Energy prices have soared since the February invasion, and Europe is trying to wean itself off Russian energy. Ukraine has urged Europe to stand firm. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia wastrying to destroy the normal life of every European citizen. In his nightly address on Saturday, he said Russia was preparing a ""decisive energy attack on all Europeans"", and only unity among European countries would offer protection. And in a BBC interview broadcast on Sunday, his wife Olena said thatif support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. She reminded Britons that while rising living costs were tough, Ukrainians were paying with their lives. EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-off Cold showers as German city turns off the gas According to website Politico, European Union officials have warnedthere is likely to be a crunch point in the coming months,externalwhen countries start to feel acute economic pain while also still being asked to help the Ukrainian military and humanitarian effort. There are already small signs of discontent, with protesters taking to the streets of the Czech capital Prague on Sunday, rallying against high energy prices and calling for an end to sanctions against Russia. Police said about 70,000 people, mainly from far-right and far-left groups were in attendance. Meanwhile, several hundred protesters gathered at Lubmin in north-eastern Germany, the terminal of the Nord Stream gas pipeline from Russia. They were calling for the commissioning of Nord Stream 2, a new pipeline which was about to go online but was blocked by the German government after the invasion. Two days ago, Russia said it was suspending gas exports to Germany through the already operating Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. The stand-off with Russia has forced countries like Germany to find supplies elsewhere, and its stores have increased from less than half full in June to 84% full today. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told journalists Germany would get through the winter, adding that Russia was ""no longer a reliable energy partner"". He said the government would make one-off payments to pensioners, people on benefits and students. There would also be caps on energy bills. Some 9,000 energy-intensive businesses would receive tax breaks to the tune of â¬1.7bn. A windfall tax on energy company profits would also be used to mitigate bills, Mr Scholz said. The energy crisis has forced Germany to bring this coal-fired power station back onto the grid The latest package brings the total spent on relief from the energy crisis to almost â¬100bn, which compares to about â¬300bn spent on interventions to keep the German economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. Countries across Europe are considering similar measures. UK Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has saidshe will announce a plan to deal with energy costs within a weekif she becomes prime minister on Tuesday. And EU energy ministers are due to meet on 9 September to discuss how to ease the burden of energy prices across the bloc. A document released about the meeting says the agenda will include price caps for gas and emergency liquidity support for energy market participants, Reuters news agency reported.

"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Detectives investigating the murder of a former Fettes College teacher have found the body of a man in Northumberland. Former biology teacher Dr Peter Coshan, 75, has been missing since he was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August. Paul Black, 63, and Paul McNaughton, 27, have been charged with Dr Coshan's murder. Police said the body was found on land close to the A696 near the village of Kirkwhelpington on Sunday. The body has not been formally identified, but Mr Coshan's family has been made aware. Borders area key to finding ex-teacher's body Two men charged with murder of ex-Fettes teacher Det Supt Andrew Patrick, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said: ""Our thoughts remain with Peter's family at this incredibly difficult time and we are continuing to provide them with support. ""I would like to take the opportunity to pass on our thanks to everyone who has come forward with information which has helped our investigation."" Detectives investigating the murder of Dr Coshan said last week that they believed the Scottish Borders and Northumberland area were ""key"" to finding his body. The body was found near Kirkwhelpington in Northumberland Dr Coshan taught at the prestigious Fettes College from 1972 until his retirement in 2005. He joined a year after former PM Tony Blair attended the private school from 1966 to 1971. The former teacher was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh, near Leith, on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. His home in Stockbridge is four miles from where he was last seen. Warm tributes were paid to Dr Coshan after his death. Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, said: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many. ""Not least by those who were taught by him, tutored by him and introduced to the hills through his enthusiasm for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he ran for 33 years.""

"Nicola Sturgeon said that tackling the cost-of-living crisis would be ""front and centre"" in her plans. The Scottish government will set out an emergency budget within two weeks of the new prime minister's fiscal plan, the first minister has said. Liz Truss is the pollsters' favourite to become the next Tory leader and UK prime minster. The new leader will take office on Tuesday, the same day Nicola Sturgeon sets out her agenda for the year. Ms Sturgeon has so far said tackling the cost-of-living crisis would be ""front and centre"" of her plans. However, opponents have accused her party of ""sleeping at the wheel"" while focusing on independence. Households across the UK are preparing for an80% increase to energy billsthis October. Ms Sturgeon said she would build on measures to support household budgets, including the Scottish Child Payment, the Carers Allowance Supplement and the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. Truss vows energy plan in a week if she becomes PM How rising prices are affecting people in Scotland Firms facing 200% price hikes 'are the lucky ones' Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the first minister said the Scottish government would set out an emergency budget within two weeks of ""whatever budget or fiscal event the new prime minster has"". She said the Scottish government was working on the assumption that this would happen at the end of September. The first minister told Sky News she was ""profoundly concerned"" about the impact a new UK government budget would have on Scotland and the other devolved nations. Ms Sturgeon has called for a freeze on energy prices ""Right now we are working within budgets that are effectively fixed and finite. They are not rising in line with inflation but the inflationary pressures are bearing down on our budget as they are on the household budgets of families across the country,"" she said. ""Any move - and this is a real risk - that would cut our budget within this financial year would obviously be of profound concern because it would have big implications for the National Health Service, for local authority budgets, for every aspect of our spending."" Ms Sturgeon said she did not agree with tax cuts as relief for families as they targeted those who were best off, and set out what she would like to see from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak once the new Conservative leader is announced on Monday. Truss vows energy plan within week if elected PM ""Freeze energy prices first and foremost, come to an agreement then between government and the energy companies about how that is paid back over a longer period of time,"" she said. ""Effectively spread and share the burden of the soaring gas prices. Help businesses because businesses don't even have the limited protection of an energy price cap."" Any new prime minister should also work to get more cash into the pockets of those who need it most and ""free up more spending ability"" for the devolved governments so they could protect public services, the first minister said. ""There's a package that a new prime minister could bring to bear and it would deliver real help and relief to millions across the UK,"" she added. The first minister has also said she would seek to work constructively with the next prime minister, despite having traded attacks with both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak throughout the campaign. And she claimed an independent Scotland could have already passed an emergency budget, adding: ""Instead we are left wrestling with meeting the challenges of fair pay, household hardship and rising costs for public services without the tools we need to tackle them."" Scottish Labour has called on the Scottish government to introduce an emergency Cost of Living Act. The legal changes the party wants to see include a temporary rent freeze, a ban on winter evictions and changes to laws on debt including fairer rules on earnings, arrestment and bankruptcy fees. Scottish Labour's Neil Bibby said every party had a ""moral duty"" to back the plans. He added: ""Scots expect their Parliaments to be focused on the issues that matter and their governments to use every power they have - but both the SNP and the Tories are asleep at the wheel."" Scottish Conservative Chairman Craig Hoy MSP said Ms Sturgeon had failed on a number of commitments including drug deaths, police funding and free school meals. He said: ""The Scottish people want and deserve a government that focuses on their priorities. Instead, Scotland has to suffer an SNP administration which is obsessed with its own self-serving goal of breaking up the UK."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton accused the SNP of using the summer break to focus on independence. He called for an emergency insulation programme, more funding for ferry services and said the government should prioritise NHS recruitment by offering staff annual leave guarantees, higher pay and better conditions.

"Passengers were unable to move their cars as the queues built up Travellers heading to the UK have suffered delays of up to six hours as they queued at the Port of Calais. Ferry operators DFDS and P&O Ferries apologised for the long wait times at UK border controls on Saturday. Passengers shared their ""misery"" at being stuck in cars for hours heading back from mainland Europe, especially as some had children with them. DFDS said queues could reach two and a half hours at border controls on Sunday. A spokesperson earlier told BBC News: ""Calais was affected by 'the perfect storm' of summer volumes in combination with post-Brexit border checks, causing six hours of queuing. ""We worked together with partners to reduce the queues as quickly as we could."" Jo Van Herwegen, from Surrey, said she ""felt lucky"" to have water with her while she waited for five hours in the French heat with her two children. Speaking to BBC News, she said: ""It was little to do with the amount of people but with the poor layout and no traffic control. ""We were travelling back from Belgium and expected to be delayed, so arrived early. ""There weren't many cars but an hour later we had moved just two cars. The way this terminal is designed is the problem."" Passenger Josh Williams added he was also stuck waiting in Calais for five hours on Saturday to get a ferry back to the UK. He shared pictures of long lines of cars filled with families trying to get back to Dover ahead of the new school year starting for many in England next week. People at the port reported delays lasting nearly six hours Leanne Wood, from near York, and her two children arrived home in the early hours of Sunday morning because of the queues at Calais. She said: ""We arrived early and the queues started forming but it was taking too long because there was no space for the cars. ""The reason for the delay seemed to be British passport control - they seemed to be on a 'go slow'. ""They knew there would be British families coming back but it was as though they wanted to create misery - to make a point."" Earlier on Saturday afternoon, DFDS warned on social media the queues could potentially last for six hours for people travelling from Calais. P&O added extra vessels were used for passengers who had missed their booked sailings, to ""help with the passengers that have been stuck at border control"", as queues continued into the evening. The issue appeared to be improved on Sunday, when DFDS said at 12:00 BST there were 45 minute queues at border control, and no waits at check-in. It earlier said traffic at the ports in Dunkirk, in France, and Dover, in the UK, was ""free-flowing through check-in and border controls"" throughout the day. P&O Ferries tweeted that queues were at about an hour. But DFDS went on to post just before 18:00 BST that although there were ""no queues at check-in"", there were currently ""queues of up to 150 minutes at border controls"" in Calais. It added the Dunkirk port was now seeing waiting times of about 45 minutes too. At the start of the school holidays in July there were long queues of traffic in Dover as people tried to get through French border control to head to mainland Europe Passenger Craig Price, from Essex, told the BBC he spent five hours at Calais Saturday afternoon after driving through Italy and France. ""We arrived at 3pm and got through at 8pm,"" he said. ""The design of the port does not seem able to cope with the need for French and UK border control,"" he said, adding that two-thirds of UK border control booths were manned. The BBC has approached the Home Office and Border Force for comment. There were similar wait times in Calais just days earlier on 24 August due to extra traffic arriving from the Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel Le Shuttle passengers had to leave their vehicles and walk through an emergency service tunnelwhen the train's alarms went off. Have you been affected by delays at Calais?

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Olivia died after being shot by a gunman chasing a man into her home A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder over the killing of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel. The 34-year-old from Liverpool is being questioned by detectives from Merseyside Police. Two other men, aged 29 and 41, have been detained on suspicion of assisting an offender. Olivia was shot when a gunman chased another man into her home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on 22 August. The man arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder was detained in Runcorn in the early hours of Sunday and is being held in custody, police said. The 41-year-old, from Knowsley, Merseyside, was also arrested in Runcorn. Police said the 29-year-old man was arrested later after officers executed warrants at two addresses in the ""Liverpool area"". Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We still need the public's help in ensuring that we can a build a strong evidential picture so justice is served for Olivia and her family. ""I appeal for those who may have information - no matter how small - that could continue to help our inquiries, to contact us directly or anonymously and we will do the rest."" Investigators found the remains of several bullet casings in the garden Olivia was shot in the chest by a gunman who had chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee into her home. Neither of the men who entered the home had any links to her family. Her mother Cheryl was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the attacker but he fired two more shots at the man he had pursued, Merseyside Police said. On Tuesday,the opening of the inquest into Olivia's deathheard how an armed police officer had tried to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to hospital in the back of a police car. Merseyside Police had previously arrested two men on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder butreleased them on bail a week ago. One of the men, aged 36, had been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence. Saturday's Merseyside derby featured a tribute to Olivia and a police appeal On Saturday,a minute's applause was heldin tribute to Olivia during the ninth minute of the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool. The Merseyside derby also featured a police appeal for information and an anti-knife and gun crime banner was unfurled, stretching across supporters from both clubs. Olivia was one of four people fatally shot or stabbed within one week in the region. Her funeral is due to take place at St Margaret Mary's Church in Dovecot on 15 September and her family has asked mourners to wear a ""splash of pink"" for the service.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also repeated the UK's supportfor the two nations' bid to join Nato. ""Whilst there is war in Europe, it is more important than ever to strengthen our international partnerships,"" he said. ""We welcome Finland and Sweden's application to join Nato and will continue to exercise together so we are ready to face shared security challenges.

"Priti Patel has urged the new commissioner to transform the Met The Metropolitan Police must learn from the ""appalling mistakes of the past"", the home secretary has said. Priti Patel has written to incoming commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, urging a ""transformation"" of the force. In the three-page letter, dated 2 September, she referred to several high-profile incidents which she said had ""affected public trust"". Dame Cressida Dick quit as head of the Met in March following criticism over the handling of a number of scandals. Among the high-profile controversies during her tenure was themurder of Sarah Everard by a serving Met Police officer. That case, among other recent incidents, were referred to as evidence the force needs ""extensive reform"" by Ms Patel. She wrote in the letter: ""Several recent high-profile incidents have affected public trust and confidence across communities particularly in London - raising serious questions about the culture and standards in the [Met]."" Other controversies referred to in the letter includestrip searches of children,the investigation into abusive behaviour at Charing Cross, and theStephen Port case. Sir Mark, who will become the head of the service on 12 September, takes over at a difficult time for the Met, with a new home secretary likely to be appointed once either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is appointed as the next prime minister. Elsewhere in her letter, Ms Patel wrote: ""It is absolutely vital that trust and confidence is restored and that visible, responsive policing which cuts crime is at the forefront."" She added that she expected the new commissioner to ""promote better leadership and higher standards at every level throughout the force"", and said that the Met was ""failing to get the basics right"". Ms Patel said the recruitment of 20,000 additional officers remained a ""key priority"" for the government, but also raised concerns that ""levels of police staff in the Met have not grown in line with the funding the government has provided"". Dame Cressida quit as Britain's most senior police officer following criticism from London Mayor Sadiq Khan over her handling of racist, misogynist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers based at Charing Cross police station. A report earlier this week by ex-chief constable of constabulary Sir Tom Winsor foundDame Cressida ""felt intimidated"" into quittingand was effectively ""constructively dismissed"" from her role by the mayor. Mr Khan disputed the findings, saying the report by the former boss of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services was ""clearly biased and ignores the facts"".

"Cameron Norrie moved up to a career-high ranking of ninth in the world at the end of last month US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app British number one Cameron Norrie reached the US Open fourth round for the first time with a composed victory over Denmark's 28th seed Holger Rune. Norrie maintained focus to win 7-5 6-4 6-1 after Rune, 19, complained the Briton was taking too much time to serve by aborting his ball toss. Seventh seed Norrie plays Russian ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the last 16. Dan Evans could not join him after a 7-6 (13-11) 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 7-5 loss in four hours to 15th seed Marin Cilic. ""It is nice to be through in straight sets and not really playing my best tennis leading in to it,"" said Norrie, who has not dropped a set this week. ""I felt I definitely improved from my previous matches and I managed to stay way calmer than he was in the bigger moments. ""I don't know what was going on with him."" Nadal beats Gasquet to continue US Open charge Kvitova saves two match points in tie-break win Serena's top 10 moments - vote for your favourite 'We are both electric' - Medvedev ready for Kyrgios Norrie made his Grand Slam breakthrough with a memorable run to the Wimbledon semi-finals in July and, after another straight-set victory in New York, is quietly working his way through the US Open draw. The 27-year-old left-hander, who was still ranked 74th in the world at the start of 2021, had never progressed past the third round at a major before his performance at the All England Club. ""Ticking that box to make the second week for the first time was huge for me. It was a big goal of mine to play well at Slams and play deep in Slams and to have these match-ups,"" he said. ""I think it does help going into the tournament, being ranked where I am, being seeded where I am."" Norrie is the only British singles player left in the tournament after 20th seed Evans was beaten by Croatia's Cilic, who won the title in 2014. In the men's doubles, Briton Neal Skupski and Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof, seeded second, beat Americans Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 to reach the last 16. Relive how Norrie reached the US Open last 16 Serena Williams - the woman who changed the game Williams waves farewell after US Open exit Calm assurance on the court is one of Norrie's key strengths and this was another example of him locking in to get the job done without any fuss. Rune, who is already earning a reputation for creating drama, began to get tetchy towards the end of the second set as his frustrations at the match slipping away from him grew. After spurning a break point as Norrie tried to serve out the second set at 5-4, Rune became agitated by the Briton stopping during his ball toss. He remonstrated with umpire Timo Janzen, claiming Norrie was doing it with ""four, five, six"" seconds left on the 25-second shot clock and suggesting there should be a code violation issued to his opponent. Rune said it was a ""bit of a distraction"", but did not think Norrie was doing it deliberately. Norrie later said he was not doing it on purpose. ""It is a bit annoying but I am not controlling the rules. I think you can do it a couple of times but 10-15 times is maybe too much,"" said Rune. Norrie ignored the issue and eventually served out for a two-set lead, before racing through the third in 29 minutes. Evans and Cilic shared warm words at the end of their titanic battle, with the Briton graciously telling his opponent he had ""been better"" Evans was aiming to match his run to the fourth round in New York last year, which is the joint furthest he has ever been at one of the sport's four majors. The 32-year-old has spoken about his liking for the North American hard-court swing, but to reach the last 16 again he faced a tough task against big-serving Cilic. The former world number three has performed consistently well on the New York hard courts over the years - apart from a first-round exit last year when he retired injured - and also reached the French Open semi-finals this season. Evans was unable to take any of three set points in an intense opening tie-break where both players had numerous chances, before 33-year-old Cilic eventually got over the line with his seventh opportunity of the set to close it out after 81 minutes. ""It was a tough match and Marin probably played a bit better than me. I missed chances in the first and you never know what happens if you win the first set,"" said Evans. There was also a bizarre moment when the Briton complained to the umpire about a heckler and many of the crowd chanted for the man to be kicked out. The fan was not removed by security but left of his own accord a few games later. ""He was ruining everybody's day really. He was rude to Marin and then to me,"" said Evans. ""It was better for everyone he left because there were kids around and his language wasn't great. The match actually took off when he left."" Evans, ranked 23rd in the world, recovered well from the disappointment of not winning the first set to break early in the second and, after Cilic fought back, raised his game again to edge another decided by a tie-break. Cilic upped his standard in the third to a level which befitted his status as a former champion, leading Evans to say his opponent was ""hitting every single line"". The Briton stayed in touch in a more even fourth but had to save a match point at 5-4 when his serve came under real pressure for the first time in the set. Then Cilic pounced on Evans' serve again at the next opportunity. A double fault put the Croat 30-0 ahead and he completed victory in three hours and 59 minutes when Evans pulled a forehand wide on the second match point. ""He served well and it was heavyweight versus lightweight in terms of serving,"" said Evans. ""It was difficult to put pressure and when I did he was unreturnable. He was too good. ""It's frustrating I played a guy who is very good here and has won the tournament, he played like he probably was playing then.""

"Conservative Party leadership frontrunner Liz Truss says if she becomes PM tomorrow she will act on energy bills within a week She says she wants to help with bills, but also improve energy security and would allow fracking for gas if local people support it Rival Rishi Sunak says he cannot rule out blackouts this winter if he becomes PM, as the UK is facing ""a genuine emergency"" on energy He says he will stay on as a MP if he loses the leadership race, but doesn't rule out running again to be PM One of the two will be announced as the new Tory leader tomorrow, and on Tuesday become the UK's new prime minister Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg interviews the biggest names inside and outside of politics each week Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining us for our live coverage this morning. The page was brought to you by Kate Whannel, Catherine Evans, Jo Couzens, Rob Corp and Claire Heald. You canwatch Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg hereand read our latest on the leadership campaign, the war in Ukraine and all the day's politics,here. Rob CorpSunday with Laura Kuenssberg You would expect to get a news line out of a Sunday morning interview show, and today's has certainly delivered. We learned that Liz Truss, if she wins the Tory leadership election tomorrow and becomes prime minister on Tuesday, will act within a week to help businesses and households with their energy bills - although she wouldn't tell us exactly how. She also spelled out her economic leanings: that she believes cutting taxes for everyone will boost the economy, meaning more money for the NHS (which is facing arguably its toughest winter ever). In his interview, Truss' rival Rishi Sunak - who many think will not be the crowned the winner tomorrow - said he had put the public finances on a sound footing while in government, and that would help deal with this current crisis. And he said he would stay on as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire if he loses out to Truss. But he didn't rule out another tilt at the leadership if a vacancy arises in the future. Reality Check Laura asked Rishi Sunak if people who could not pay their energy bills should be
cut off. âWe
have actually protection for these people,â he responded. It
is relatively unusual to be disconnected, with companies generally installing
prepayment meters instead. The meters make customers pay for energy before they
use it. According to figures,externalfrom the regulator
Ofgem, 21 households had their supply disconnected last year. If
energy companies want to disconnect the supply of a customer who has not paid a
bill after 28 days there are restrictions on that. They
would need to give the customer a chance to clear their bill through a payment
plan and they may need to apply to a court for a warrant to enter the property
to disconnect the supply. There
are also rules preventing certain vulnerable people being disconnected - such as
people of state pension age who live alone or people who live with children. You can read more about it here. Chris MasonPolitical editor The biggest moment of the summerâs campaign to replace Boris
Johnson as Prime Minister was when Liz Truss said there would be support for
people paying their energy bills, having previously rejected the idea of what
she called âhandoutsâ. Vanishingly few people, if anyone, now seriously disputes that she is
going to win. Strikingly, Liz Truss did not dispute the Sunday Timesâ suggestion
this morning the intervention could be huge â costing around Â£100bn. And we now know sheâll set out her plans within a week of
taking office. But we still await the information which really matters: who
will get support, how much support and for how long? Laura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg What was also intriguing about Liz Truss' ideas for government - should she win tomorrow - is that she defended her plan to cut National Insurance, saying it was fair for people who earned more to get more back. What's obvious from that part of our conversation is that Liz Truss thinks differently about how policymakers think about choices for the economy. She raised a smile when I asked her about people poking fun at her over the years - and perhaps even poked fun at herself. She might not be the slickest candidate but it looks like she has outwitted the rest. The most notable policy promise from Liz Truss was the
timing of significant changes to tax and spend - the announcement of help on energy bills is
coming within a week, then within a month we will get wider policy changes, including the reversal of the National Insurance rise (announced by Rishi Sunak as chancellor) and the cancellation of
planned rises to Corporation tax (also Sunak). This sets up a dilemma for her, should she
win tomorrow. Assuming that the Truss energy policy will not save everyone from the
incredible bill rises in the pipeline, she will inevitably have to deploy the argument
that the public finances wonât allow such ongoing open-ended support. But
presumably she will have accounted for the tens of billions of pounds that the
government number crunchers will say her tax cut policies cost. That will lead to many more of the
questions, such as that posed by Laura, about how such tax cuts mainly benefit
the rich, which Ms Truss acknowledged was âinevitableâ. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says he can't solve the issue around energy bills for everyone Rishi Sunak has said he cannot solve everybody's energy bill problems, should he win the leadership context. Instead, he's outlined how his plans include targeted support for pensioners and those on the lowest incomes. But he told Laura Kuenssberg, if elected, he would go further than the support already announced and said everyone would receive some financial assistance. During this morning's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Liz Truss was asked if she would freeze energy bills, as proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Truss said it would be wrong to go into details on what it is she would do should she win power, but promised to act within a week. In response, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey says: ""Liz Truss' refusal to come clean on her plans is leaving people worried sick about how they will afford to heat their homes this winter."" He says his party will introduce a proposed law to Parliament in the coming days implement a bill freeze - however, unless it has government support it is extremely unlikely to become law. This video can not be played Liz Truss promises to act immediately on bills and energy supply Conservative leadership hopeful Liz Truss says if she is elected she will immediately act to help people with soaring energy bills. Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she promised an announcement on energy bills and supply within a week if she is elected. Laura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Liz Truss promised within a week -  if she wins the Conservative leadership election, and so becomes prime minister - that she will come out with a substantial package of support on energy bills - including for businesses as well as households. She also wants us to think she has a long-term plan to sort out our energy supply. What's tricky is that she's so close to winning power that she didn't want to elaborate on the kind of real support firms and families will actually receive. There are suggestions she might be prepared to spend tens and tens of billions of pounds on this - but simply we are going to have wait another few days to hear what that looks like. You probably wouldn't expect glowing reviews of two Tory leadership candidates coming from the opposition. But Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who was on today's panel, started off by calling Liz Truss a ""lightweight"", saying that in her opinion, the foreign secretary has little regard for detail. Following both Truss's and Sunak's interviews, Thornberry says she's ""disappointed that we're yet to hear a proper plan coming from either of these leadership candidates"" regarding the energy crisis facing the country. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also been out and about on the political programmes this morning. Speaking to Sky News, she predicted Liz Truss would be a ""disaster"" as prime minister, if she governs the way she has campaigned. She accused Ms Truss of focusing too much on tax cuts adding: ""The obsessions of a tiny, tiny number of Conservative Party members are not the right priorities for the country."" But, the SNP leader went on to say, whoever becomes the next prime minister should get a chance to prove themselves, and that she hoped for a constructive relationship with them. Reality Check Laura asked each of leadership rival guests about how they would handle the economy and plans for tax and spending, should they become prime minister. Liz Truss discussed her proposal to cancel the planned
increase in corporation tax. The tax on company
profits is due to rise from 19% to 25% in April 2023 - a plan implemented by her predecessor and rival, former chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""Last time we
cut corporation tax we saw the revenues increase,"" she said. The idea is that
keeping taxes low increases economic growth, which means the tax take increases
even though the rate is lower. The economic
think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned against this
assumption saying: ""The effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax
cut to pay for itself"". In fact, Laura Kuenssberg put exactly this point to the would-be prime minister. The IFS said that the
fact that tax revenues had risen in 2019 despite lower headline rates of
corporation tax did not provide evidence that cutting rates automatically raised more
revenues - with other things going on such as the continuing recovery from the
financial crisis. Talking about the cost of living, Liz Truss said this morning: ""Inflation is projected to peak, so we do know that inflation will come down."" That's what the Bank of England has said. It expects inflation to hit 13.1% this winter when the full impact of the (latest) rises in energy bills reaches households. However, economists reckon the peak could be much higher. US investment bankCitigroup predicts it would reach 18%,which would be the highest for nearly 50 years. It should be noted that Citi's prediction is on the more aggressive side, though consultancy firm EY-Parthenon has also predicted high inflation - at 15.4%. But how much are prices rising for you?Use our inflation calculation here Rishi Sunak took his turn answering Laura's questions - so what did the rival leadership contender have to say? Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Earlier on, Liz
Truss was asked by Laura Kuenssberg about the current state of the NHS. Truss said if she wins the Tory leadership election tomorrow to become prime minister on Tuesday, a key
priority of her administration will be primary care and GP appointments. She said this was
âabsolutely critical and very difficult at the momentâ. That is a different
emphasis to past health ministers  - who have said cutting ambulance handover
delays is the main focus this winter. Liz Truss did say waiting times for
hospital treatment would come down and she would ask her health secretary to
come up with a clear plan of how to achieve that. This begs the question of
what happens to the existing recovery plan drawn up by NHS England and agreed
by a previous health secretary Sajid Javid. Against
the backdrop of a very tough winter ahead exactly what Liz Truss has in mind
for improving GP access and cutting waiting lists will be keenly anticipated by
health leaders and patients. Rob CorpSunday with Laura Kuenssberg After checking back in with the panel - Emily Thornberry notes the interview with Olena Zelenska on the situation in Ukraine was a moving one, the closing credits roll and the first Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg is off the air. I'll head to the post-show gathering to get the thoughts of Laura on how she felt the show went and whether we now know more about what additional help a government led by either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak might give to people trying to deal with steep rises in the cost of day-to-day life. Asked what his plans are for the future if he doesn't the Tory leadership tomorrow, Sunak says he will stay on as MP for Richmond, in North Yorkshire. He's reminded that before entering politics, he lived and worked in California - might he go there is the hint. But he's clear he's staying on in Parliament. He adds his role now is to support the government. Would he run again? He doesn't rule it out. He says he needs to recover from this campaign first and adds that his job now is to support the Conservative government. Should people who cannot pay their bills be cut off, Sunak is asked. Sunak says he doesn't want that situation to arise, and adds there are protection for people struggling. He says his record during the Covid pandemic shows he would support the most vulnerable. Asked if he would plan for blackouts and energy rationing if he became prime minister, Sunak says ""we shouldn't rule anything out"". ""We're facing a genuine emergency,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nicola Sturgeon said that tackling the cost-of-living crisis would be ""front and centre"" in her plans. The Scottish government will set out an emergency budget within two weeks of the new prime minister's fiscal plan, the first minister has said. Liz Truss is the pollsters' favourite to become the next Tory leader and UK prime minster. The new leader will take office on Tuesday, the same day Nicola Sturgeon sets out her agenda for the year. Ms Sturgeon has so far said tackling the cost-of-living crisis would be ""front and centre"" of her plans. However, opponents have accused her party of ""sleeping at the wheel"" while focusing on independence. Households across the UK are preparing for an80% increase to energy billsthis October. Ms Sturgeon said she would build on measures to support household budgets, including the Scottish Child Payment, the Carers Allowance Supplement and the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. Truss vows energy plan in a week if she becomes PM How rising prices are affecting people in Scotland Firms facing 200% price hikes 'are the lucky ones' Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the first minister said the Scottish government would set out an emergency budget within two weeks of ""whatever budget or fiscal event the new prime minster has"". She said the Scottish government was working on the assumption that this would happen at the end of September. The first minister told Sky News she was ""profoundly concerned"" about the impact a new UK government budget would have on Scotland and the other devolved nations. Ms Sturgeon has called for a freeze on energy prices ""Right now we are working within budgets that are effectively fixed and finite. They are not rising in line with inflation but the inflationary pressures are bearing down on our budget as they are on the household budgets of families across the country,"" she said. ""Any move - and this is a real risk - that would cut our budget within this financial year would obviously be of profound concern because it would have big implications for the National Health Service, for local authority budgets, for every aspect of our spending."" Ms Sturgeon said she did not agree with tax cuts as relief for families as they targeted those who were best off, and set out what she would like to see from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak once the new Conservative leader is announced on Monday. Truss vows energy plan within week if elected PM ""Freeze energy prices first and foremost, come to an agreement then between government and the energy companies about how that is paid back over a longer period of time,"" she said. ""Effectively spread and share the burden of the soaring gas prices. Help businesses because businesses don't even have the limited protection of an energy price cap."" Any new prime minister should also work to get more cash into the pockets of those who need it most and ""free up more spending ability"" for the devolved governments so they could protect public services, the first minister said. ""There's a package that a new prime minister could bring to bear and it would deliver real help and relief to millions across the UK,"" she added. The first minister has also said she would seek to work constructively with the next prime minister, despite having traded attacks with both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak throughout the campaign. And she claimed an independent Scotland could have already passed an emergency budget, adding: ""Instead we are left wrestling with meeting the challenges of fair pay, household hardship and rising costs for public services without the tools we need to tackle them."" Scottish Labour has called on the Scottish government to introduce an emergency Cost of Living Act. The legal changes the party wants to see include a temporary rent freeze, a ban on winter evictions and changes to laws on debt including fairer rules on earnings, arrestment and bankruptcy fees. Scottish Labour's Neil Bibby said every party had a ""moral duty"" to back the plans. He added: ""Scots expect their Parliaments to be focused on the issues that matter and their governments to use every power they have - but both the SNP and the Tories are asleep at the wheel."" Scottish Conservative Chairman Craig Hoy MSP said Ms Sturgeon had failed on a number of commitments including drug deaths, police funding and free school meals. He said: ""The Scottish people want and deserve a government that focuses on their priorities. Instead, Scotland has to suffer an SNP administration which is obsessed with its own self-serving goal of breaking up the UK."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton accused the SNP of using the summer break to focus on independence. He called for an emergency insulation programme, more funding for ferry services and said the government should prioritise NHS recruitment by offering staff annual leave guarantees, higher pay and better conditions.

"This video can not be played Olena Zelenska tells Laura Kuenssberg about the human cost of the war The economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, the country's first lady has told the BBC, but as Britons ""count pennies"", Ukrainians ""count casualties"". Olena Zelenska told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. In an interview recorded in Kyiv, she also said it was important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war. And Mrs Zelenska said while she rarely saw her husband, they talk every day. The first lady, who has been married to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since 2003, spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in Kyiv. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Sunday 4 September, Mrs Zelenska was asked what message she had for British people who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on global gas and oil prices. ""I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it's still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. ""The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. ""So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties,"" she said. Johnson: Endure energy crisis to counter Russia Ukraine's president: Johnson's support was special Russia shuts major gas pipeline to Europe - again Mrs Zelenska's comments follow Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion while visiting Kyiv last month that households across Europe would have to endure the cost of living crisis and ""stay the course"" with Ukraine to counter Russia's aggression. In the UK, the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the economy is expected to shrink for more than a year. President Zelensky has been praised for staying with his people following the Russian invasion The Bank of England said the main reason for high inflation and low growth was rising energy bills, fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European countries have accused Russia - a major global supplier of energy - of using gas as a weapon by limiting supplies in response to sanctions.

She said that many parents would have been moved by the story of a Ukrainian boy who was filmed crossing the Polish border in floods of tears last March. ""I think that fathers and mothers watching this video could not but break into tears. I always place myself in their situation and I think that everyone - every human in the world should feel the same,"" Mrs Zelenska said. ""That's why we have to tell these stories, to show these stories, because these are the faces of a war. Not the number of bombs dropped, not the amount of money spent, human stories - and there are a thousand stories like that around."" Ms Zelenska and her husband attended a public event together in May The first lady, who comes from the same town as her husband and has known him since university, said she was ""insulted"" by people who said they were surprised at his transition from TV actor to wartime leader. ""He's the man I've always known.  He wouldn't do anything else,"" she said. Asked whether she hoped to come to the UK after it was chosen to host the Eurovision Song Contest because Ukraine - which won the event this year - was deemed to be too unsafe, Ms Zelenska said she would ""love to go"" .

"""Get Brexit done"" was the central theme of the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto. During his last week in office, Boris Johnson talked about his record in government - highlighting policies on police recruitment and broadband. He became prime minister and won a landslide victory in 2019 and made a series of pledges to voters. Delivering on them was made harder by the Covid pandemic, but how did he get on? The Conservatives promised this for England and Wales by March 2023. Latest figures,external, up to 30 June 2022, show an extra 13,790 police officers recruited. That means the government is two-thirds of the way there with one year to go. But that rise still hasn't made up for police numbers falling by20,545 between March 2010 and March 2019,external- under Conservative-led governments. The Conservatives promised this for England by March 2025. Latest figures,externalshow 319,846 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in May 2022. That is up 23,753 since December 2019, leaving 26,247 posts to fill. On GPs,there were 35,257 full-time equivalents in post in July 2022,external. That's up by just 738since the end of December 2019,external. If you exclude locums (doctors who temporarily fill a rota gap) and trainees, GP numbers have actually decreased by 314 since December 2019. In November 2021, the then Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I'm not going to pretend we're on track when we're not."" This 2019 pledge was to be met ""over the next 10 years"". In August 2021, the government came up with several definitions for what it said constituted a ""new"" hospital: A whole new hospital on a new site or current NHS  land A major new clinical building on an existing site or a new wing of an existing hospital A major refurbishment and alteration of all but building frame or main structure In December 2021,analysis by BBC Reality Check, found that of the 40 hospital projects announced by the government: 22 were rebuilding projects 12 were new wings within existing hospitals three involved rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals three were entirely new hospitals When asked for an update, on 7 June 2022, a Department of Health spokesperson told us that one of the 40 hospitals ""opened for patients last year and a further six are in construction"". This manifesto pledge was to be met by ""the mid-2020s"". In 2019-20, there were 242,700 net additional dwellings, which fell to 216,490 in 2020-21. Net additional dwellings includes houses converted to flats, commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well as new builds. It also factors in demolished houses. What's happened to the government's housebuilding target? The prime minister was asked about the pledge on 9 June 2022 and said: ""I can't give you a cast iron guarantee that we're going to get to a number in a particular year."" This was achieved in a literal sense as the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Britain departed from the EU's single market and customs union 11 months later, after agreeing a basic free trade deal with the EU. But if this election slogan implied Brexit would be done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. A huge amount remains unresolved, from Northern Ireland to financial services. Alarge number of trade dealshave been signed around the world (most to replace the ones the UK already had as an EU member) but a deal with the US hasn't happened. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes economic judgements for the government,predicts,externalthat leaving the EU will reduce the UK's imports and exports by about 15% in the long term, with about a 4% hit to productivity. Supporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut. This was not possible while the UK was in the EU because of rules giving citizens the freedom to live and work in all EU countries. After Brexit, the government did launch this system. EU citizens wishing to live and work in the UK now have to apply for a visa via a points-based system (PBS), the same as citizens from the rest of the world. The process has not been all plain sailing. Leaving the EU single market is one of the factors thatcontributed to an HGV driver shortage,because EU drivers can no longer come and go as they please. The government hadto introduce 5,000 temporary visasfor this sector. How does the new UK points-based immigration system work? How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? This manifesto pledge was broken. In September 2021, the government announced that workers, the self-employed and employers would pay 1.25p more National Insurance (NI) in the pound from April 2022. But, because of cost of living pressures, the government later reduced the impact of this by announcing that from 6 July 2022 the point at which employees would start paying NI would increase to Â£12,570. This means that in the 12 months from April 2022, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 will pay less NI than they did last year. Anybody earning more than that will pay more. The government says the money from the NI rise will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into the social care system - which Mr Johnson pledged, in 2019, to ""fix"". Social Care: Will people still have to sell their homes? What's the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? In 2021, the government unveiled its plan to cap the costs that people in England pay for social care. From October 2023, this will be set at a maximum of Â£86,000 for care during their lifetime. But the long-awaited reform of funding does not fix other problems such as the shortage of care workers.Research in May 2022estimated that 500,000 adults in England were waiting for social care, up from 294,000 a year ago. The triple lock means the state pension increases each year at whichever of these is highest: CPI inflation (the rate at which prices are rising as measured by theConsumer Prices Index) average wages or 2.5% The 2019 Conservative manifesto said it would stay for the duration of this Parliament. But this promise was broken on 7 September 2021 whenthe government announced it was suspending the triple lock for a yearand blamed the pandemic. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? The government says it will return in April 2023. This manifesto pledge has also been broken. The UK's annual aid budget has beenreduced to 0.5%,externalof GNI (gross national income) - a cut of about Â£4bn. Again, the government blamed the pandemic - saying cutting aid spending would help restore the public finances. It said the 2015 legislation, which introduced the 0.7% target, referred to ""fiscal circumstances"" which governments may refer to, if they fail to meet it. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? This 2019 manifesto pledge was scaled back the following year. In apolicy paper,externalreleased by HM Treasury in November 2020, the target had changed to ""a minimum of 85% gigabit capable coverage by 2025"". There has been considerable progress though. Gigabit coverage has gone from 10% to 70% since July 2019, according to government figures. As well as pledges, Boris Johnson has made claims about his government's record during the pandemic. The UK was the first country to approve a Covid vaccine - on 2 December 2020. Its vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 - weeks before the EU's. The UK vaccine programme was the fastest in Europe until May 2021. After that, EU countries caught up, if you look at doses per 100 people in a country's population. The prime minister has repeatedly talked about the UK having the fastest-growing economy in the G7, which is a club of major, developed economies. Whether this is true depends onwhich period,externalyou are looking at. For the whole of 2020, the UK economy contracted by 9.3%, which was the biggest decline in GDP in the G7 For the whole of 2021, it grew by 7.4%, which was the biggest growth in the G7 The IMF predicts,externalthat in 2022 the UK will have 3.7% growth, the joint second highest in the G7 (behind Canada) The OECD,externalforecasts that the UK will have zero growth in 2023, and will be the slowest growing economy in the G7 If you look at growth since before the pandemic, the UK is in third place in the G7 with 0.7% growth Update: This piece was first published on 4 October 2021 and has been updated several times since then to add pledges and update figures.

Ms Zelenska and her husband attended a public event together in May The first lady, who comes from the same town as her husband and has known him since university, said she was ""insulted"" by people who said they were surprised at his transition from TV actor to wartime leader. ""He's the man I've always known.  He wouldn't do anything else,"" she said. Asked whether she hoped to come to the UK after it was chosen to host the Eurovision Song Contest because Ukraine - which won the event this year - was deemed to be too unsafe, Ms Zelenska said she would ""love to go"" .

"Priti Patel has urged the new commissioner to transform the Met The Metropolitan Police must learn from the ""appalling mistakes of the past"", the home secretary has said.

"The two contenders to become the next PM face questions about their cost of living policies - a day before the result of the Tory leadership contest. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak will be asked about their proposals to solve pressing issues, including mounting energy bills, live on BBC One later. Presenter Laura Kuenssberg will also ask why they want the top job. Meanwhile, Ms Truss has said she will set out ""immediate action"" on bills should she enter No 10 on Tuesday. Voting has now finished and the result of the Tory leadership contest will be announced on Monday - bringing to a close an eight-week battle for the keys to 10 Downing Street following Boris Johnson's resignation speech in July. The Queen will receive Mr Johnson on Tuesday at Balmoral where he will formally tender his resignation. This will be followed by an audience with the new Tory leader, where they will be invited to form a government. On her new Sunday show, Kuenssberg will ask both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak how they will help families and businesses meet this rising cost over the winter months,the presenter said. Ms Truss, widely considered to be the favourite to succeed Mr Johnson as prime minister, has not yet detailed exactly how she would help people pay their bills. But writingin the Sunday Telegraph,external, the foreign secretary promised ""immediate action"" on energy bills and supply. Ms Truss said she will take a ""two-fold"" approach to the crisis - offering immediate financial support for households and businesses while also trying to solve the problems exposed by the impacts of Covid and war in Ukraine. The cost of living crisis and what should be done to tackle it has been one of the key dividing lines during the leadership contest. The foreign secretary has said she would tackle the crisis by putting money back into people's pockets, such as by immediately reversing the National Insurance rise and suspending the green levy on energy bills. Mr Sunak, meanwhile, has pledged to cut VAT on energy bills, a plan that would cost Â£5bn, and has unveiled a plan to find a further Â£5bn to help the poorest households. As Boris Johnson packs up his premiership - on Monday, we will find out who is moving into No 10. The new prime minister will enter Downing Street on Tuesday with one issue dominating the agenda: soaring energy bills - for households and businesses. Liz Truss is widely expected to win the Tory leadership contest - but she has not spelt out precisely what she would do to help people pay their energy bills. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she promises ""immediate action"" on energy bills and energy supply, saying ""sticking plasters"" won't solve the fundamental problem. The issue dominated the campaign - which saw Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak tear into each other's economic plans and the record of the government. Meanwhile, the outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays it is time for the Tories to unite,external. Either way, by Tuesday, we will have a new prime minister facing formidable challenges. Their response to the energy bills crisis could define their time in office. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said neither Mr Sunak or Ms Truss had grasped the scale of the problems facing the country, warning a new Tory leader would not mark a ""new dawn"". Sir Keir warned the ""centre is not holding"" and that things are ""falling apart"", stressing his own pragmatism and desire for progress on energy bills, the NHS and crime. IN-DEPTH:Boris Johnson's track record as PM EXPLAINED:What does the prime minister actually do? He wrotein the Sunday Telegraph,external: ""I came to politics after a long career. That makes me impatient. ""It also means I favour common-sense, practical solutions over ideological purity. If I were stepping into Downing Street this week, I'd ensure no-one would pay a penny more for their energy bill this winter.""
