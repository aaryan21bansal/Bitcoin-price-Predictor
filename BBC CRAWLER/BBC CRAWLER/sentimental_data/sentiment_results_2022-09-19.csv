"This video can not be played Smiling Adnan Syed is cheered as his conviction is tossed A US judge has quashed a Baltimore man's murder conviction in a case that spawned hit true crime podcast Serial. Adnan Syed was 18 when he was sentenced to life in prison for the death of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, whose body was found buried in the woods in 1999. Prosecutors last week asked the court to throw out his conviction, saying a year-long case review had turned up two alternative suspects. Mr Syed will be released into home detention. The 41-year-old's shackles were taken off in court on Monday after he spent nearly 23 years behind bars. Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn said she was vacating his conviction ""in the interest of fairness and justice"", adding the state had failed to share evidence that could have helped his defence at trial. Adnan Syed and Serial: What you need to know The decision does not mean he is innocent. Judge Phinn has ordered a new trial. A jury found Mr Syed guilty in 2000 of premeditated murder, kidnapping, robbery and false imprisonment. Prosecutors argued he was a scorned lover who had strangled Ms Lee, his classmate at Woodlawn High School, and - with the help of a friend - hid her body in Baltimore's Leakin Park. They relied in part on mobile phone location data that has since been proven unreliable. Every appeal Mr Syed filed over the past two decades was denied, including his most recent attempt in 2019. It was the 2014 podcast Serial that focused worldwide attention on the case and cast doubt on Mr Syed's guilt. Episodes of the show have been downloaded more than 340 million times. The case has also spawned other works, including an HBO docuseries in 2019. The Baltimore State Attorney's Office, which studied the case over the past year alongside Mr Syed's latest defence attorney, said on Wednesday that he deserved a new trial. Prosecutors said they lacked ""confidence in the integrity of the conviction"" and had identified two new potential suspects who were known to police since the 1999 murder. Neither suspect has been named, but officials said both had documented records of violence towards women, including convictions that occurred after Mr Syed's trial. One suspect was cleared from the investigation into Ms Lee's death after failing a lie-detector test, a method no longer admissible in many US courts. ""Our prosecutors have been sworn to not only aggressively advocate on behalf of victims of crime but when the evidence exists to exonerate those that have been falsely accused and convicted,"" lead prosecutor Marilyn Mosby said outside the court. She was interrupted by loud cheers as Mr Syed exited the building through a scrum of cameras and supporters. Before the ruling, the victim's brother told the court through tears that he was ""not against the investigation"", but had been blind-sided by prosecutors. ""Every day when I think it's over... or it's ended, it always comes back. It's killing me,"" said Young Lee. ""This is not a podcast for me. This is real life - a never-ending nightmare for 20-plus years."" Steve Kelly, a victim's rights lawyer for the family, said the Lees had been ""shut out of the legal process"" and were ""deeply disappointed"" with the way they had been treated. ""All they wanted was information,"" said Mr Kelly. ""If the truth is that somebody else killed their daughter, they want to know that more than anyone."" Serial Productions, which produced the podcast, has just released a new episode - the 13th - about the latest in the legal saga. It reports that last year Mr Syed's legal team applied for a review of his sentence under a new Maryland law which applies to those given more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed when they were under 18 (Mr Syed was 17 at the time of the murder). As part of this sentence review, an official in Baltimore city's state attorney's office examined the case files - and found two handwritten notes relating to information phoned in about a potential alternative suspect, the podcast reports. It was these notes that were not shared with the defence team in violation of legal protocol, it says. Serial brought international attention to the murder of Hae Min Lee and was one of the first hit podcasts of the past decade's boom in audio content. It was followed by other shows which raised questions about existing murder convictions or drew attention to cold cases - attracting big audiences and also, possibly, having an impact on the course of justice. They include In the Dark, a US podcast focusing on the case of Curtis Flowers, a black Mississippi man tried six times for the same crime by the same white prosecutor.His conviction was subsequently quashed by the US Supreme Court over racial biasand he was released after 23 years in prison in 2019 The unsolved killing ofAlistair Wilson, a father-of-two who was shot on his doorstep in the seaside town of Nairnin the Scottish Highlands in 2004, was the focus of the BBC's podcast The Doorstep Murder, which came out in 2018. His death remains unsolved but Police Scotland's major investigations team said earlier this year they believe a planning dispute was the likely motive A popular crime podcast about anAustralian man who was found guilty of his wife's murder- 40 years after she went missing. Chris Dawson was charged with the murder of his wife Lynette in 2018 after the podcast, The Teacher's Pet, garnered global attention and prompted a renewed investigation.

"This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds of people filling streets Police faced ""significant aggression"" and some were injured as they dealt with disorder in Leicester, the force's chief constable has said. Sixteen officers and a police dog were injured on Saturday as they worked to stop groups of men from attacking each other, Rob Nixon said. The unrest came amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. The policing operation is continuing into Monday evening. A 20-year-old man from Leicester was jailed for 10 months, according to Leicestershire Police, after he pleaded guilty on Monday to possession of an offensive weapon. Mr Nixon said officers had been brought in ""from all sorts of different parts of the country"" to help with the operation. ""They were faced with significant aggression, I think they faced some very, very challenging situations, and I actually do believe they put themselves in danger to protect the public,"" he said. ""I have to say, I was actually on the ground [on Saturday] and I saw the level of aggression and the level of non-compliance, and I thought my officers did a tremendous job when significantly outnumbered. ""I think we were faced with a significant number of people that were intent on causing significant injury to other people, and my officers stood their ground."" Leicestershire's chief constable said the main objective on Saturday was to keep groups of people separated Some officers cancelled their days off in order to help, including those from other forces. ""These people are being drawn in at a time when there is probably the largest policing operation in the country, linked with the state funeral, so these things are having a broader impact,"" Mr Nixon said. Police said the original disorder on Saturday had been sparked by a protest in the East Leicester area. Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday, but police said there had been no further disorder overnight into Monday. Two people were arrested during the disorder on Saturday - one on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and the other on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Police said a further 18 people were arrested on Sunday night for offences including affray, common assault, possession of an offensive weapon and violent disorder. Police officers were brought in from other forces to help Some community members have criticised police for not making more arrests during the original disorder. Mr Nixon said: ""Clearly making arrests in that really dynamic situation can take officers away from what they're trying to do at that time. ""The primary objective on Saturday night was to keep separation between these large groups. ""Within that there were two people that were arrested, but what I will say is there were significant steps taken in terms of securing the video imagery of people. ""We've got an investigative team that has been put in place for each area of these disorders, and we're then going back over and investigating it."" Officers prevented people marching down Belgrave Road on Sunday The disorder over the weekend was the latest of several incidents, including violence after an India and Pakistan cricket match on 28 August. Police said a total of 47 people had been arrested in relation to unrest in the east of Leicester since 28 August. These include people from outside of the city, including some from Birmingham. Leicester's elected mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby,said he and community leaders were ""baffled"" by the eventsover the weekend. ""It got fanned by some very distorted social media,"" Mr Soulsby said. ""And then fuelled by a lot of people who came in from outside as well as some young local lads who seemed to feel it was appropriate to frighten and disturb this peaceful city. ""I also know there was also a concerted attempt on Saturday to bring people from as far as Birmingham, to ship them across to have a bit of a 'set-to' in Leicester."" Later on Sunday, police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area Community leaders in the city have joined police in calling for calm. Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations, told the BBC: ""There are some very dissatisfied young men who have been causing havoc. ""We need to get the message out that this must end and try to do this through parents and grandparents talking to their sons."" Sanjiv Patel, who represents Hindu and Jain temples across Leicester, said: ""Violence is not a solution to anything. This has to be a time for peace, calm and engagement."" Leicestershire Police Federation said the injuries to the police officers were ""utterly despicable"". Chairman Adam Commonssaid,external: ""My colleagues do not come to work to be subjected to this type of behaviour and should not be going home nursing cuts and bruises. ""One of our police dogs has also been injured in a disgraceful attack. ""They are all trying to do their job and keep people safe.""

"Video posted online showed the aftermath of an explosion in a square in western Donetsk Thirteen people have been killed and others wounded in a series of explosions in the separatist-run city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, according to its Russian-backed mayor. Alexei Kulemzin blamed ""punitive"" Ukrainian shellfire for the deaths. There is no comment from Ukrainian officials. Donetsk has been controlled by Russia's proxy authorities since 2014. They have repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of targeting the city. Independent confirmation is hard to come by on the ground in separatist-held areas of the east. However, local authorities said nine 150mm shells were fired at the Kuibyshevsky district of Donetsk, from a village to the west of the city. Local leader Denis Pushilin accused Ukraine of deliberately targeting civilians at a bus-stop, a shop and a bank. Although Russian forces have seized areas of the Donetsk region further south since the invasion began in February, they have struggled to push the Ukrainian army back from the outskirts of the city itself. Ukrainian forces have launched counter-offensives in the south as well as the north-east, and their most dramatic progress has come this month in the northern Kharkiv region. The head of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, shared video of a Ukrainian tank crossing a pontoon bridge, and said Ukraine now controlled the left bank of the Oskil river, seen as the front line in north-east Ukraine. Ukraine's armed forces said they had pushed across the river at the weekend If Ukrainian forces are able to maintain a foothold on the eastern side of the Oskil, it will represent a breakthrough. Mr Haidai said the next target would be liberating the city of Lyman, which was seized by Russian forces in May. ""Luhansk region is right next door. De-occupation is not far away,"" he claimed. In his nightly address late on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that recent days may have looked like a lull of sorts: ""But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series... For Ukraine must be free. All of it."" Russia was accused on Monday of targeting a nuclear plant in the south. Ukrainian nuclear operator Enerhoatom said a rocket landed 300m (1,000ft) from nuclear reactors at the country's second-largest plant in Mykolaiv region, called the South Ukraine plant. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was told by Enerhoatom that the impact temporarily disrupted three power lines, but the plant remained connected to the grid, with all three reactors functioning normally.

Ukraine's - and Europe's - biggest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia has come under repeated fire since it was occupied by Russian forces at the start of the war and the IAEA has called for a safety zone to protect it. The IAEA said the situation there ""remains fragile and precarious"". Its six reactors are in a shutdown state, but are getting essential power to remain safe. Mass exhumations at Izyum forest graves site Who is winning the war in Ukraine? Meanwhile, the Kremlin has denied allegations of war crimes after some 450 bodies were uncovered in burial sites in the liberated city of Izyum. The discovery has prompted the European Union's presidency, currently held by the Czech Republic, to call for an international tribunal into Russia's invasion. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the revelations were ""a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story"".  He said the ""scenario"" was the same as in the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where local authorities say at least 458 civilians were murdered during Russia's occupation. President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Ukrainian counter-offensives would not change Russia's military plans in the east of Ukraine. The ministry of defence in Moscow posted video on Monday that it said showed attack helicopters destroying Ukrainian manpower and equipment. However, according to the UK's defence intelligence update, it was ""highly likely"" thatRussia had lost four combat jets in Ukraine,externalin the past 10 days as its air force took greater risks to support ground forces under pressure from the Ukrainian advances. The Institute for the Study of War says Russia is relying increasingly on ""irregular volunteer and proxy forces"" instead of its conventional military units. Russia says it is fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine - a claim widely dismissed - and that it is threatened by the Nato alliance's strong relations with Ukraine. Since the invasion on 24 February,the UN has recorded at least 5,718 civilian deaths, with 8,199 injured,external, andmore than seven million Ukrainians have been recorded as refugees,externalacross Europe. The actual civilian death toll is believed to be thousands higher. Tens of thousands of combatants have been killed or injured. Russia, a global energy supplier, is locked in an economic struggle with the West which imposed sweeping sanctions in response to the invasion.

"More than 90 videos and images from the next edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been leaked online by a hacker, the game's developers say. The leaked content was posted on Sunday after what is being described as one of gaming's biggest security breaches. Rockstar Games said it remained unclear how the ""network intrusion"" occurred, but confirmed ""early development footage"" from GTA VI had been stolen. The footage was put on the GTAForums site by a user called teapotuberhacker. The hacker claimed to have gained access to the data by breaching Rockstar's internal feed on the Slack messaging app, and invited executives to negotiate to avoid further leaks. Additional revelations could include source code, assets, and testing builds from both GTA 5 and GTA 6, which could be damaging to the company's operations. While the original post has since been removed by moderators, it has been spread widely on social media. Rockstar has reportedly issued takedown orders to remove the footage from YouTube and Twitter. The footage showed animation tests, level layouts and some gameplay demonstrations, and it appeared to confirm a long-running rumour that the game will feature the series' first playable female protagonist. They also revealed the game's setting in a fictionalised version of Miami which was also the setting on 2002's GTA: Vice City. In a statement on Monday, the company said it was ""extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way"". ""Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations,"" it added. Rockstar confirmed it wasdeveloping the game earlier this year,with industry insiders anticipating a 2024 or 2025 release date. Some fans had speculated that the leak could see the game's release delayed, but executives said they did not anticipate ""any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects"". GTA 5 has sold more than 170 million copies since its release in 2013, making it one of the most successful video games of all time. In 2020, its online mode is estimated to have generated more than $900 million (Â£788 million) alone.

The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was told by Enerhoatom that the impact temporarily disrupted three power lines, but the plant remained connected to the grid, with all three reactors functioning normally.

Ukraine's - and Europe's - biggest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia has come under repeated fire since it was occupied by Russian forces at the start of the war and the IAEA has called for a safety zone to protect it. The IAEA said the situation there ""remains fragile and precarious"". Its six reactors are in a shutdown state, but are getting essential power to remain safe. Mass exhumations at Izyum forest graves site Who is winning the war in Ukraine? Meanwhile, the Kremlin has denied allegations of war crimes after some 450 bodies were uncovered in burial sites in the liberated city of Izyum. The discovery has prompted the European Union's presidency, currently held by the Czech Republic, to call for an international tribunal into Russia's invasion. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the revelations were ""a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story"".  He said the ""scenario"" was the same as in the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where local authorities say at least 458 civilians were murdered during Russia's occupation. President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Ukrainian counter-offensives would not change Russia's military plans in the east of Ukraine. The ministry of defence in Moscow posted video on Monday that it said showed attack helicopters destroying Ukrainian manpower and equipment. However, according to the UK's defence intelligence update, it was ""highly likely"" thatRussia had lost four combat jets in Ukraine,externalin the past 10 days as its air force took greater risks to support ground forces under pressure from the Ukrainian advances. The Institute for the Study of War says Russia is relying increasingly on ""irregular volunteer and proxy forces"" instead of its conventional military units. Russia says it is fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine - a claim widely dismissed - and that it is threatened by the Nato alliance's strong relations with Ukraine. Since the invasion on 24 February,the UN has recorded at least 5,718 civilian deaths, with 8,199 injured,external, andmore than seven million Ukrainians have been recorded as refugees,externalacross Europe. The actual civilian death toll is believed to be thousands higher. Tens of thousands of combatants have been killed or injured. Russia, a global energy supplier, is locked in an economic struggle with the West which imposed sweeping sanctions in response to the invasion.

"Police and protesters in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon Fifteen people have been arrested in an operation to ""deter further disorder"" in Leicester. There waslarge-scale unrest on Saturdayamid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Police said it had been sparked by an ""unplanned protest"". Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday. Leicestershire Police said there had been no further disorder overnight. The force added that all 15 people arrested on Sunday remained in custody. Leicester's elected mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said he and community leaders were ""baffled"" by the events, saying they had been ""fanned by some very distorted social media"" and ""a lot of people who came in from outside"". Officers prevented people marching down Belgrave Road During Sunday's protest people congregated on Belgrave Road, with members of the crowd telling the BBC they were on the streets as a result of the recent unrest. Officers closed the road and some of the crowd briefly tried to push through police lines, complaining they were being prevented from marching. Later, the protesters walked along Green Lane Road, in the North Evington area, followed by officers. There was also a police presence on Humberstone Road, with several nearby streets closed off. The force said in a statement: ""Officers became aware of groups of young men gathering on Sunday afternoon in the North Evington area of the city. ""Officers spoke to them and took steps, including putting in place a temporary police cordon, to minimise harm and disturbance to communities."" Police had said they wanted to avoid a repeat of Saturday night's confrontations, and that dispersal powers would be used to break up any further gatherings. The force has also issued a warning about misinformation and rumours, and urged people to be careful about what they shared on social media. Later on Sunday, police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area Sir Peter said: ""It got fanned by some very distorted social media. And then fuelled by a lot of people who came in from outside as well as some young local lads who seemed to feel it was appropriate to frighten and disturb this peaceful city. ""I've seen a selection of the social media which is very, very distorted - some of it completely lying - about what had been happening between different communities. ""I also know there was also a concerted attempt on Saturday to bring people from as far as Birmingham, to ship them across to have a bit of a 'set-to' in Leicester. ""All of those things taken together seem to have escalated the celebration of a cricket match into something that for the city is very disturbing indeed. ""I don't want to minimise the impact but there is no obvious local cause for this at all."" He also paid tribute to police for ""stamping on it quickly"". Mr Soulsby added he and community leaders were ""confident Leicester is resilient enough to be able to return to normal relations very soon"". Community leaders in the city have called for ""peace and engagement"". Protesters could also been seen moving down Green Lane Road, flanked by police Sanjiv Patel, who represents Hindu and Jain temples across Leicester, said he was deeply saddened and shocked by the recent disturbances. He said: ""We are horrified and deplore what was going on [on Saturday] and across the last two weeks. ""Across the Hindu and Jain community and with our Muslim brothers and sisters and leaders we are consistently saying 'calm minds, calm heads'."" He added: ""Violence is not a solution to anything. This has to be a time for peace, calm and engagement."" Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations, told the BBC: ""What we have seen on the streets is very alarming. ""There have been problems in the community since the India and Pakistan cricket match and while that game often sparks gatherings they have not in the past turned this ugly. ""We need calm - the disorder has to stop and it has to stop now. There are some very dissatisfied young men who have been causing havoc. ""We need to get the message out that this must end and try to do this through parents and grandparents talking to their sons."" Two men were arrested after Saturday's disorder - one on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and another on suspicion of possession of a bladed article. They remain in custody.

"Wu Zunyou's comments have drawn controversy A top Chinese health official has warned locals against touching foreigners, a day after China recorded its first monkeypox infection. In a post on Weibo, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wu Zunyou advised against ""skin-to-skin contact with foreigners"". The post drew controversy, with some labelling it as racist. Comments on the original post have since been disabled from the platform. ""In order to prevent possible monkeypox infection and as part of our healthy lifestyle, it is recommended that 1) you do not have direct skin-to-skin contact with foreigners,"" Mr Wu wrote on his Weibo page on Saturday. In addition, he called for locals to avoid skin-to-skin contact with recent travellers who had returned from abroad in the past three weeks, and with strangers. He posted the comments a day after the south-western city of Chongqing reported its first case of monkeypox in an person who arrived from abroad. It is not clear if they were a Chinese citizen or a foreigner. The post, which was widely shared on social media over the weekend, drew largely critical comments on Weibo. ""This is very inappropriate [to say]. At the start of the pandemic, some foreigners stood up and [defended us] by saying that Chinese people are not viruses,"" wrote one user. ""How racist is this? What about the ones like me who have been living in China for almost ten years? We haven't seen our families in like 3-4 years due to borders being closed,"" wrote another Weibo user, who appeared to be a foreigner. China has imposed some of the world's toughest Covid measures since the start of the pandemic, which have included snap lockdowns, border closures, mandatory testing and travel restrictions. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? WHO declares highest alert over monkeypox The monkeypox virus, which is transmitted through close contact with infected people, animals or contaminated materials, usually causes symptoms such as fever, headache and rashes. Around 90 countries where monkeypox is not considered endemic have reported outbreaks of the viral disease, which the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency. There have been more than 60,000 confirmed cases and some non-endemic countries have reported their first related deaths.

Here, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of God our maker and redeemer. With gratitude we remember her unswerving commitment to a high calling over so many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth. With admiration we recall her life-long sense of duty and dedication to her people. With thanksgiving we praise God for her constant example of Christian faith and devotion. With affection we recall her love for her family and her commitment to the causes she held dear. ""Now, in silence, let us in our hearts and minds recall our many reasons for thanksgiving, pray for all members of her family, and commend Queen Elizabeth to the care and keeping of almighty God. O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who hast taught us, by his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our mediator and redeemer. Amen. All sang the hymn St Clement The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended, the darkness falls at thy behest; to thee our morning hymns ascended, thy praise shall sanctify our rest. We thank thee that thy Church unsleeping, while earth rolls onward into light, through all the world her watch is keeping, and rests not now by day or night. As o'er each continent and island the dawn leads on another day, the voice of prayer is never silent, nor dies the strain of praise away. The sun that bids us rest is waking our brethren 'neath the western sky, and hour by hour fresh lips are making thy wondrous doings heard on high. So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never, like earth's proud empires, pass away; thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever, till all thy creatures own thy sway. John Ellerton (1826-93) Clement Scholefield (1839-1904) arranged by James O'Donnell (b 1961) The Right Honourable the Baroness Scotland of Asthal KC, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, read the first lesson: Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.1 Corinthians 15: 20-26, 53-end A specially commissioned piece was sung by the choir. It was a setting of Psalm 42 to music composed by the Master of The King's Music, Judith Weir: Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God : when shall I come to appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God? Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God; In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day. Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul : and why art thou so disquieted within me? Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance. Prime Minister Liz Truss read the second lesson: Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.John 14: 1-9a All sang the hymn 'The Lord's my shepherd' - which was was also sung at Prince Philip and the Queen's wedding in 1947: The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want; he makes me down to lie in pastures green; he leadeth me the quiet waters by. My soul he doth restore again, and me to walk doth make within the paths of righteousness, e'en for his own name's sake. Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale, yet will I fear none ill; for thou art with me, and thy rod and staff me comfort still. My table thou hast furnished in presence of my foes; my head thou dost with oil anoint, and my cup overflows. Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me; and in God's house for evermore my dwelling place shall be.Psalm 23, attributed to Jessie Seymour Irvine (1836-87) harmony by David Grant (1833-93) descant by William Baird Ross (1871-1950) The sermonwas delivered by the Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan. The choir sang the Anthem: My soul, there is a country Far beyond the stars, Where stands a wingÃ¨d sentry All skilful in the wars: There above noise, and danger, Sweet Peace sits crowned with smiles, And One born in a manger Commands the beauteous files. He is thy gracious friend, And (O my soul, awake!) Did in pure love  descend, To die here for thy sake. If thou canst get but thither, There grows the flower of Peace, The Rose that cannot wither, Thy fortress, and thy ease. Leave then thy foolish ranges, For none can thee secure, But One who never changes, Thy God, thy Life, thy Cure.From Songs of Farewell, Hubert Parry (1848-1918), by Henry Vaughan (1621-95) The prayers The Reverend Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor, lead the prayers from the High Altar: In confidence and trust, let us pray to the Father. The Reverend Dr Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: Let us give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth's long life and reign, recalling with gratitude her gifts of wisdom, diligence, and service. O God, from whom cometh everything that is upright and true: accept our thanks for the gifts of heart and mind that thou didst bestow upon thy daughter Elizabeth, and which she showed forth among us in her words and deeds; and grant that we may have grace to live our lives in accordance with thy will, to seek the good of others, and to remain faithful servants unto our lives' end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Ms Shermara Fletcher, Principal Officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England, said: Confident in God's love and compassion, let us pray for all those whose hearts are heavy with grief and sorrow. Almighty God, Father of all mercies and giver of all comfort: deal graciously, we pray thee, with those who mourn, that casting every care on thee, they may know the consolation of thy love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Right Reverend and Right Honourable Dame Sarah Mullally DBE, Bishop of London and Dean of His Majesty's Chapels Royal, said: Let us pray for His Majesty The King and all the Royal Family; that they may know the sustaining power of God's love and the prayerful fellowship of God's people. Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless our most gracious Sovereign Lord King Charles, Camilla The Queen Consort, William Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family: endue them with thy Holy Spirit, enrich them with thy heavenly grace; prosper them with all happiness; and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Reverend Canon Helen Cameron, Moderator of the Free Churches Group, said: In recognition of Queen Elizabeth's service to this United Kingdom, let us rejoice in her unstinting devotion to duty, her compassion for her subjects, and her counsel to her ministers; and we pray for the continued health and prosperity of this Nation. O almighty God, whose will it is that all thy children should serve thee in serving one another: look with love, we pray thee, on this Nation. Grant to its citizens grace to work together with honest and faithful hearts, each caring for the good of all; that, seeking first thy kingdom and its righteousness, they may possess all things needful for their daily sustenance and the common good; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. His Eminence Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, said: Let us give thanks for Queen Elizabeth's commitment to the Commonwealth throughout her reign, for her service and dedication to its peoples, and for the rich bonds of unity and mutual support she sustained. Almighty and everlasting God, hear our prayer for the Commonwealth, and grant it the guidance of thy wisdom. Inspire those in authority, that they may promote justice and the common good; give to all its citizens the spirit of mutual honour and respect; and grant to us all grace to strive for the establishment of righteousness and peace; for the honour of thy name. Amen. The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York, Primate of England and Metropolitan, said: We give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth's loyalty to the faith she inherited through her baptism and confirmation, and affirmed at her coronation; for her unswerving devotion to the Gospel; and for her steadfast service as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Lord, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in continual godliness; that through thy protection she may be free from all adversities, and devoutly given to serve thee in all good works, to the glory of thy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Precentor said: Let us pray that we may be given grace to live as those who believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, and the resurrection to eternal life. Bring us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of heaven, to enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor hopes, but one equal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in the habitation of thy glory and dominion, world without end. Amen.John Donne (1572-1631) The choir sang 'O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is', composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the Queen's Coronation in 1953. The Precentor concluded: In confidence and hope, let us pray to the Father in the words our Saviour taught us, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. All stood to sing the hymn Blaenwern: Love divine, all loves excelling, joy of heaven, to earth come down, fix in us thy humble dwelling, all thy faithful mercies crown. Jesu, thou art all compassion, pure unbounded love thou art; visit us with thy salvation, enter every trembling heart. Come, almighty to deliver, let us all thy life receive; suddenly return, and never, never more thy temples leave. Thee we would be always blessing, serve thee as thy hosts above, pray, and praise thee, without ceasing, glory in thy perfect love. Finish then thy new creation, pure and spotless let us be; let us see thy great salvation, perfectly restored in thee, changed from glory into glory till in heaven we take our place, till we cast our crowns before thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise!Charles Wesley (1707-88) William Rowlands (1860-1937) arranged by James O'Donnell The Commendation, given by the Archbishop of Canterbury: Let us commend to the mercy of God, our maker and redeemer, the soul of Elizabeth, our late Queen. Heavenly Father, King of kings, Lord and giver of life, who of thy grace in creation didst form mankind in thine own image, and in thy great love offerest us life eternal in Christ Jesus; claiming the promises of thy most blessed Son, we entrust the soul of Elizabeth, our sister here departed, to thy merciful keeping, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, when Christ shall be all in all; who died and rose again to save us, and now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, in glory for ever. Amen. Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world, in the name of God the Father almighty, who created thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee and anointed thee. In communion with all the blessed saints, and aided by the angels and archangels and all the armies of the heavenly host, may thy portion this day be in peace, and thy dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem. Amen. Anthem - the choir sings Romans 8: 35a, 38b-end, composed for this Service by Sir James MacMillan CBE (b 1959) Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Alleluia! Amen. The Dean of Westminster pronounced the Blessing: God grant to the living grace; to the departed rest; to the Church, The King, the Commonwealth, and all people, peace and concord, and to us sinners, life everlasting; and the blessing of God almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, be among you and remain with you always.

"King Charles III has said he is ""deeply touched"" by the support he has received from across the world, ahead of the Queen's funeral. The King said he and Camilla, the Queen Consort, were ""moved beyond measure"" by everyone who took the trouble to pay their respects. ""As we prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you,"" he said. The state funeral service at Westminster Abbey began at 11:00 BST. Some 2,000 people are attending the ceremony, including 500 presidents, prime ministers, and foreign royals from around the world. The King is leading the nation in mourning for its longest-reigning monarch. Your guide to the Queen's funeral What time is the Queen's funeral? Who will wear uniform? Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? In a written message issued by Buckingham Palace, the King said: ""Over the last 10 days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched by the many messages of condolences and support we have received from this country and across the world. ""In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother, the late Queen. ""As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief."" This photograph of the Queen at Windsor Castle was taken in May this year An unseen portrait of the Queen has also been released by Buckingham Palace on the eve of her funeral. The photograph, taken by Ranald Mackechnie ahead of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations in May, shows the monarch beaming brightly at the camera in her Windsor Castle home. She is wearing a blue dress, her favourite three-strand pearl necklace, pearl earrings and her aquamarine and diamond brooches - an 18th birthday present from her father George VI in 1944 which she also wore on the 75th anniversary of VE Day in 2020. King Charles held a reception at Buckingham Palace on Sunday evening for heads of state attending the funeral. Later, at 20:00, a national minute's silence was observed at homes and doorsteps across the UK. Many thousands of people have queued this week to see the Queen's lying-in-state, which ended at 06:30 on Monday. The queue was closed to new entrants shortly after 22:40 on Sunday. At 10:44, her coffin was taken in procession from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey in the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy. King Charles walked behind, alongside the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex. Behind them were the Queen's grandsons, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Sussex and Peter Phillips. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are also attending the Queen's funeral. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will give the sermon, told the BBC people could expect ""a great deal of grandeur and pomp"" from the service but he also hoped it would help the Queen's family ""find a measure of comfort amidst the glare of publicity"". ""In the readings and the prayers, it will be something that, again, I pray will fit the Queen's character and person. You'll think not just this was a service fit for a Queen, this was a service fit for this person,"" he added. Following the service, the coffin will be drawn in a walking procession from the Abbey to Wellington Arch, at London's Hyde Park Corner. With the route lined with military personnel and police, Big Ben will toll at one-minute intervals as the procession moves slowly through the streets of the capital. Parliament officials said they were confident the bell would ring out during the procession after investigating a ""minor technical issue"" which prevented it from striking on Sunday, following the national minute's silence. Gun salutes will also fire every minute from Hyde Park during the procession and people can watch in person from designated viewing areas along the route. Once at Wellington Arch, at about 13:00, the coffin will be transferred to the new State Hearse for its final journey to Windsor Castle. There, the Queen's coffin will enter St George's Chapel for a committal service. Attended by a smaller congregation of about 800 guests, the committal service will be conducted by Dean of Windsor David Conner, with a blessing from the Archbishop of Canterbury. At a private family service later, the Queen will be buried alongside her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, at the King George VI memorial chapel, located inside St George's Chapel.

"The queue for members of the public to see Queen Elizabeth II lying in state has now closed King Charles thanks people around the world for their support since the death of his mother He says he has been ""so deeply touched"" by the many messages of condolence and support before the Queen's ""last farewell"" World leaders have been arriving in London ahead of the Queen's state funeral on Monday US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have paid their respects to the late monarch at Westminster Hall Camilla, the Queen Consort, has paid tribute to the Queen, telling a BBC programme she âcarved her own roleâ in a world dominated by men Edited by Gareth Evans Our live coverage is moving ahead of the Queen's state funeral on Monday, which will see world leaders and foreign royals join members of the Royal Family on a momentous day. You can follow the latest developments here. The closing of the queue to see the Queen lying in state brings to an end what has become a familiar sight over the last few days. Images of thousands of people lining up in London at all hours of the day, often in chilly temperatures, are some of the most striking to come out of this historic period. The wait time at one stage was estimated to be more than 24 hours; and the queue snaked from Westminster Hall, down along the River Thames and stretched south for almost 7 miles (11km). The map below shows the queue over the weekend. It brought together people from all walks of life - young children, older people who remembered watching the Queen's coronation on television in 1953, and celebrities such as David Beckham who waited for 12 hours. Some even travelled from outside of the UK to pay their respects. ""Thereâs a profound sense of shared grief and affection for Her Majesty in this huge, diverse gathering of people from around the world,"" Canadian politician Jason Kenney wrote on Twitter as he stood in line. The queue closed to members of the public at around 22:30 BST on Sunday. The Queen will continue to lie in state until 06:30 on Monday ahead of her state funeral later in the day. Kristian JohnsonReporting from Blackfriars Bridge Shortly before 11pm, the last wristband was
handed out. Those lucky enough
to secure the final few places in the queue are now making their way past
Blackfriars Bridge and are being escorted by marshals. They still have a
long way to go though - it is a two-mile walk from their position to the end
point and they wonât arrive at Westminster Hall until the early hours of Monday
morning. Several people without wristbands are
still following the official end of the queue, but they will not be permitted
entry to the Queen's lying-in-state. A previously unseen portrait of the Queen has been released by Buckingham Palace on the eve of her funeral. The portrait was taken at Windsor Castle in May to mark the Platinum Jubilee, and shows the monarch smiling at the camera. The Queen is wearing a blue dress and pearl jewellery. The diamond clip brooches were an 18th birthday present from her father George VI in 1944. The portrait was shared on Twitter by the Royal Family, which said: ""Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life."" The queue for members of the public to see the Queen lying in state has closed, the government says. It asks people not to attempt to join the queue, saying stewards will manage those already nearby. The Queen will continue to lie in state until 06:30 BST on Monday, ahead of her funeral service in nearby Westminster Abbey at 11:00. Allow Twitter content?

Debbie JacksonBBC Scotland Scotlandâs moment of reflection started early with lone
pipers playing sombre laments at sites in Dornoch, Fort William, Inverness and
Portree. A spectacular display took
place at The Kelpies in Falkirk, during a service at the Queen Elizabeth II
canal. The ceremony saw 96
lanterns - one for each year of the Queen's life - being lit and lowered into
the Kelpies pool of reflection beneath the giant, 30m (98ft) high Kelpies
sculptures. Wreaths were also floated
in the water as a lone piper played. Deputy First Minister John
Swinney took to the steps of the Scottish government's St Andrew's House in
Edinburgh alongside cabinet members Angus Robertson, Ben Macpherson, Jenny
Gilruth, and Lesley Fraser, the director general corporate. In
Glasgow, Rev Mark E Johnstone began a Service of Preparation at Glasgow
Cathedral ahead of the silence. Tennis
Fans at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow fell silent for a minute at the Davis Cup
group D match between Great Britain and Kazakhstan. An
image was beamed on the big screen as the moment was marked. Tennis Fans at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow fell silent for a minute at the Davis Cup group D match King Charles has thanked people around the world for their
support since his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died. ""Over the last 10 days, my wife and I have been so deeply
touched by the many messages of condolence and support we have received from
this country and across the world,"" he said. ""In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were
moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their
respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother, the late Queen. As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my Family and myself in this time of grief.  The BBC has projected an image of the Queen onto Broadcasting
House, the corporation's headquarters in central London - and home to BBC News. Passers-by were seen taking pictures of the monarch on the famous facade - which has previously had general
election results displayed on it.  This video can not be played The BBC has captured footage of people around the UK taking part in a one minute silence the evening before the Queen's funeral. Prime Minister Liz Truss was seen standing outside 10 Downing Street with her head bowed. And crowds of people were filmed silently paying tribute in towns across the UK including Newport, in Wales, Belfast, in Northern Ireland, Blackpool in England and Falkirk, in Scotland. As we reported yesterday, King Charles III thanked emergency service staff at New Scotland Yard for their work during the mourning period and ahead of the Queen's funeral on Monday. The funeral is expected to be one of the largest international event that the UK has hosted in decades. Vast numbers of extra officers from across the UK have been deployed to the capital to help the Metropolitan Police cope. As the Met gears up for Monday's state funeral - the force has released some figures behind its large policing operation: Big Ben was originally planned to strike before after the
minute's silence, which was hold at 20:00 on Sunday. However, this did not happen, prompting an ""urgent""
investigation. Big Ben, in the Elizabeth Tower, has a big task on Monday as it
is set to toll once every minute as the Queenâs coffin leaves Westminster
Abbey. A UK Parliament spokesperson said: ""We are investigating
this as a matter of urgency but are confident that it will not affect the
tolling tomorrow during the state funeral procession."" People could be heard clapping and cheering after the silence
ended. The Ministry of Defence has shared behind-the-scenes snippets of members of the UK Armed Forces taking rests and having some down time in-between standing by the Queen's coffin. The MoD wrote on Twitter: ""The UK Armed Forces are continuing to honour their Commander-in-Chief of 70 years, Her Majesty The Queen, as they stand vigil alongside The King's Body Guard."" As wereported earlier, Camilla, the Queen Consort, has paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II in a special BBC programme. Sharing an intimate snapshot of her late mother-in-law, Camilla said the Queen made it a rule to have her ""private time and her private passions - and then her public role"". She said this was ""important"" because it allowed the monarch to define when she was on duty and when she was not. Referencing the Queen's love of Balmoral, where she died last week, Camilla said Scotland was where the Queen was able to ""do the things she loved"". Camilla also spoke of her joy at having had the opportunity to take the Queen to some of the charities she supports, such as the Medical Detection Dogs. ""She loved them... she asked lots of questions,"" Camilla said, adding it was ""very nice"" to take the late monarch ""to things I knew she'd enjoy"". You can watch the specialBBC Oneprogramme, The Eve of the State Funeral, on iPlayerhere. Anyone looking to join the queue to see the Queen's coffin is now being asked to head to London Bridge. As we saidearlier, waning numbers of people mean officials can slowly move the entry point further along the route to be as close to Westminster Hall as possible. ""Entry to the queue will close when it reaches final capacity,"" the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) warns in itlatest update,external. It also says the estimated wait time is now seven hours - the lowest its been in days. People across the UK observed a minute's silence at 20:00 BST in a moment of reflection for Queen Elizabeth II ahead of Monday's funeral. Crowds on the Long Walk in Windsor were among those to fall silent People waiting in the queue to see the Queen's coffin during the moment of reflection At Waterloo Station, staff and passengers stopped under a clock as they marked the moment At Westminster Hall, where the Queen is lying-in-state, the queue stopped moving As crowds wait to see the Queen's lying-in-state for the final evening, many were touched to see the evening sky light up with a rainbow. Remarkably, a rainbow was also spotted at Windsor Castle on the same day the Queen died on 8 September. The BBC's Sophie Raworth caught the reaction of people who spotted the rainbow as she noted on Sunday: ""As the sun set over Westminster tonightâ¦the crowd gasped."" Kristian JohnsonReporting from the queue Jessica Cooper, Anna Coward, Rochelle Pearson and Frazer Seabright joined the queue on Sunday night The end of the queue has moved to Tower Bridge, with the
estimated queuing time now said to be eight hours. There are still people arriving to join the crowds, including
Rochelle Pearson. She has travelled from Putney to be here and spoke to the BBC
after running to get a wristband from stewards. ""I made the decision to come half an hour ago. We just
thought: 'We canât miss this iconic occasion,'"" she said. ""We've literally thrown everything in our rucksacks and we've
just run to get here. We feel blessed to be here,"" Jessica Cooper said. The UK has finished observing a national minute's silence in honour of the late Queen Elizabeth II. However, Big Ben did not strike before and after the silence as originally planned. In a few minutes, at 20:00 BST, the UK will observe a national minute's silence to remember the Queen. As wereported earlier, Big Ben will strike once to mark the start of the moment of reflection, and again to mark its end. The iconic clock tower will also ring on Monday at one-minute intervals as the Queen's state funeral procession departs from Westminster Abbey. Thousands are expected to spend the night on the Mall in central London, in the hope of bagging a good spot to watch the funeral procession tomorrow. Among them are David and Bonnie Robertson from Lillington, Leamington Spa in Warwickshire. ""We got here at about 11 this morning when there were only two or three huddles of people, but now the front of the railing is full,"" said Mr Roberts, 66. He said the couple had been planning to be in London for the Queen's funeral for four or five years. ""We thought wouldn't it be great just to be part of that history."" ""Everyone is very friendly,"" he said, ""and some have even got better-looking sandwiches than us."" But, he added, ""underneath there's sort of a layer of solemnity going to come to the surface tomorrow I think."" The funeral procession takes place in central London on Monday Â© 2025 BBC.

"Queen Elizabeth II is laid to rest following a private burial ceremony at St George's Chapel Windsor She was buried alongside her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, and her father, mother and sister Earlier, the late monarch's coffin was lowered into the royal vault in the chapel Her Crown Jewels were removed from the top of it during a service of prayers and hymns It followed a day of ceremony, with a state funeral this morning attended by world leaders and dignitaries at Westminster Abbey Huge crowds then lined the route as her coffin was taken on a gun carriage through London and then by hearse to Windsor Edited by Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Heather Sharp, James Clarke, Emma Owen and Kevin Ponniah Our live coverage of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II is now closing. Here's a look back at the key moments from a momentous day: We'll shortly be bringing our live coverage to a close. This live page was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Nadine Yousif, Gareth Evans, Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Heather Sharp, Marianna Brady, Laura Gozzi, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Claire Heald, Thom Spender, James Clarke, Marita Moloney, Jasmine Andersson, Charley Adams, Emily McGarvey, Alice Evans, Thomas Mackintosh, and Toby Luckhurst. You can read our story on the procession to the Queen's final resting placehere. While the Queen was lying in state, on top of her coffin rested the Imperial State Crown, perhaps the most familiar treasure in the Crown Jewels - a priceless collection of tens of thousands of gemstones collected over the centuries by British kings and queens. The crown sparkles with nearly 3,000 stones - including 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and five rubies. ""It can be quite hard to look at sometimes because of the sheer light that comes off them. It's literally dazzlingâ¦ visually overpowering,"" says historian and author of The Crown Jewels, Anna Keay. Made in 1937 for the coronation of the Queen's father, King George VI, the Imperial State Crown was designed to be lighter, and to fit better, than the crown it replaced - which dated back to Queen Victoria. But nevertheless, the Imperial Crown still weighs in at a hefty 2.3lbs (1.06kg). Read more here. Katty KayUS special correspondent People in the US have watched in awe at events in the UK this week The
Americans I was with in front of Buckingham Palace today were awed by the
pageantry. But what struck me more, spending the last few days
watching my home country through the eyes of my adopted country, was the US appreciation of things that are far more modern. Coming
from a country that struggles every day with tensions around race, my US
colleagues were impressed by the multicultural nature of Britain today. They
were also struck by the sense of community, most notably in that curious
phenomenon of The Queue. It played to every American stereotype of us: ""You
see, they really are eccentric, those British!"" But the queue also showed a country
united, perhaps only temporarily, but united nonetheless. That queue was a
model of community. For Americans, whose country sometimes appears
divided beyond repair, that queue was a tantalising display of what can happen
when people have a common cause. Certainly, the phenomenal wealth and excess on
display in the Royal procession is not open to any Tom, Dick or Harry. But that pomp and
circumstance has a value to all of us beyond the spectacular show, a value
Americans may appreciate a little more these days. Aurelia FosterReporting in London Michael Orbell with his MBE âIâll never forget it, ever.â Michael Orbell watched the funeral
service in his room at the Royal Star & Garter nursing home for ex-military
service personnel in Surbiton, south-west London. âOnly we could do this in the United
Kingdom, something like this, with such pageantry and such solemnity for a
remarkable person."" For Michael, the most moving part of the
day was seeing the Queenâs coffin being paraded into Westminster Abbey. âThere
was so much solemnity there,â he said. âIt was weird how perfect it all was,
not a step out of place, the drums sounding, all marching unions, it was
staggering, nothing ever seemed to go wrong.â Michael, who served in the RAF in the
1950s, said he felt today that he and many other people had taken Elizabeth II
âfor grantedâ. âI miss her terribly because she was
always there and she never failed us, ever.â Michael, who received an MBE from the
Queen in 2012, added that the public reaction to the Queenâs death has been âvery movingâ. ""It was wonderful to see, very moving to
see, because weâre never going to something like this in my lifetime. This love
pouring out for Her Majesty, unstoppable love.â People wishing to take in the Queen's last journey gathered in pubs around the world to watch the funeral service and procession. People watch the funeral in a pub in Toronto, Canada ...and in Sydney in Australia... ...and also in Manila in the Philippines... ...and in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia... ...as well as Tokyo, Japan This video can not be played During the televised proceedings of Queen Elizabeth's final journey to Windsor Castle, the cameras briefly saw the Queen's corgis obediently waiting in the Quadrangle courtyard.

goodbye to Queen Elizabeth II with a commemorative service in the nationâs
capital and a military parade through downtown Ottawa. Royal Canadian
Mounted Police led the way, as they did at the queenâs funeral procession in
London. The service was
attended by hundreds of dignitaries with music by Canadian artists Ginette
Reno, Rufus Wainwright and Kim Richardson. In an address, the
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney remembered the Queen's support for his efforts
to rally the Commonwealth behind sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The
queen provided ""discreet guidance"" despite opposition from then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The former
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson also spoke. She said the Queen had remained
focused and calm until the end of her reign, recounting an unexpected exchange. Clarkson said the Queen had told her she would never abdicate. âIt is not in our tradition,
although I suppose if I became completely gaga one would have to do something,"" she said the Queen had told her. Canadians were
attached to the Queen right until the end, and she to Canada - she visited 22

less favourable views of King Charles III. But officials have said heâs expressed
determination to pursue reconciliation with the countryâs indigenous peoples who suffered under British colonial rule.
