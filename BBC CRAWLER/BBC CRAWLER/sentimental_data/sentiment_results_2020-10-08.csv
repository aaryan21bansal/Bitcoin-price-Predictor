"The first debate descended into insults and interruptions US President Donald Trump has refused to take part in a virtual TV debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The commission organising the debate in Miami on 15 October said it would have to take place remotely after Mr Trump tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Trump's refusal sparked a day of wrangling about how and when any further debates would take place. At the moment it appears a debate could take place on 22 October, although in what form remains to be seen. The first presidential debate on 29 September had descended into insults and interruptions. The vice-presidential debate, held on Wednesday night between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, was a far more measured affair. The US election will be held on 3 November. Latest opinion polls suggest Mr Biden has a high single digit lead nationally, but the outcome is often decided in battleground states where the races can be much closer. US election 2020: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What did we learn from the VP debate? Six million votes have already been cast in early voting. It began with the Commission on Presidential Debates announcing candidates would take part in the Miami debate ""from separate remote locations... to protect the health and safety of all involved"". This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins This infuriated the president who, in a phone-in interview with Fox Business Channel, said he was ""not gonna waste my time"" on a virtual debate and ""sit behind a computer, ridiculous"". Joe Biden said the president ""changed his mind every second"" and his campaign team added that Mr Trump ""clearly does not want to face questions from the voters"". The Trump campaign answered back, with manager Bill Stepien calling the commission's decision to ""rush to Joe Biden's defence... pathetic"" and saying Mr Trump would hold a rally instead on 15 October. The Biden team then proposed the town-hall style debate, set for Miami, should go ahead on 22 October instead. This brought a brief moment of agreement, on the date at least. Joe Biden: ""You never know what's going to come out of his mouth"" However, the Trump team said there should be a third face-to-face debate - on 29 October, just five days before polling. No, said the Biden team. Three dates had been set for debates - 29 September, 15 October and 22 October. That would be it. On 15 October, Mr Biden will now take part in his own primetime event on ABC answering questions from voters. Quite what format any Biden-Trump debate takes now is hard to pin down. He touched on a number of key matters, including his health and the possibility of movement towards a stimulus package for the economy. On his health, Mr Trump said: ""I'm back because I'm a perfect physical specimen."" Who has Trump met and who's tested positive? He said he had stopped taking most ""therapeutics"" but was still taking steroids and would be tested for Covid again ""soon"". This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House But although his doctor has said he now has no symptoms, questions still remain about when the president first became infected and whether he could still be contagious. And although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"". Top Republican avoids White House over Covid-19 Mr Trump said on Thursday that ""somebody got in and people got infected"" but gave no more details. A gathering on 26 September announcing Mr Trump's Supreme Court pick has been seen as a possible ""super-spreader"" event, with several attendees known to have tested positive. The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak The president on Tuesday had said he was breaking off talks with the Democrats on an overarching Covid stimulus package but, after a negative stock market reaction, said he would instead try to agree individual deals. He was more bullish on Thursday, saying he saw ""really good"" odds of reaching a deal on a range of issues. ""We're starting to have some very productive talks,"" he said. The main areas of progress were on assistance for airlines and a $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheque for workers. Republicans under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Democrats under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in regular discussions but have differed on the amount they want to spend. In the latest twist on Thursday, Ms Pelosi said there would be no standalone bill for the airlines without a bigger bill. Wednesday night's event in Utah was a civil debate between two smooth communicators compared to last week's belligerent showdown between Mr Trump and Mr Biden. But there were heated exchanges. Pence and Harris clash on coronavirus pandemic 'Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking now' Ms Harris accused Mr Pence and the president of deliberately misleading Americans about the lethality of coronavirus. Mr Pence accused the Biden-Harris campaign of copying the White House's pandemic strategy. This video can not be played Dodging questions and interruptions: While the VP debate was more civil, there were still moments of tension Mr Pence expressed shock at the killing of African American George Floyd in Minnesota. But he added: ""There is no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed."" US vice-presidential debate claims fact-checked Global media relieved at 'civil' debate in US Ms Harris said the president had refused to condemn white supremacists. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says it was unmemorable, with a few strong moments and a few stumbles for both, but that such a result in itself would be good news for the Democrats.

"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted Five police officers are facing an investigation over the stop and search of British athlete Bianca Williams and her partner in west London. Ms Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, whose baby son was in the car, believe they were racially profiled when they were stopped in Maida Vale, on 4 July. The Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after footage was widely shared. Sal Naseem said a ""threshold for a misconduct investigation"" had been met. The IOPC's regional director added: ""Decisions on any further action will only be made once our investigation is complete."" The Met had said officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Ms Williams, 26, accused the Met of racially profiling her partner, who was driving a black Mercedes. Three days after the incident,the Met apologised to Ms Williams. Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 The force also referred itself to the IOPC, despite two reviews by the force's directorate of professional standards concluding there had been no misconduct. The five officers will now be investigated for potential breaches of police standards of professional behaviour relating to use of force; duties and responsibilities; and authority, respect and courtesy, the IOPC said in a statement. The IOPC said its independent investigation would focus on seven points including why Mr Dos Santos's car was followed and stopped and whether the force used against Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams was lawful, necessary, reasonable and proportionate. It is also being questioned why a Merlin report, a Met-run database that stores information on children who have become known to the police for any reason, was created for Ms Williams's son. Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car Investigators will also look at whether Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos ""were treated less favourably because of their race"" as well as the accuracy of the accounts provided by the officers and the ""appropriateness of the communications"" issued by the Met. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? Met refers British sprinter stop-and-search Williams' 'heart hurts' after police stop car The IOPC statement said it would look at whether there were grounds for Mr Dos Santos to be kept in handcuffs after he had been searched. It added: ""In relation to Ms Williams the potential breaches, which will all be thoroughly investigated, include taking hold of her without first having sought her co-operation with the search; handcuffing her initially and continuing to handcuff her after she had been searched; her continued detention and whether there were grounds to do so.""

"MPs from the Midlands and northern England are calling for more detail on possible plans to close restaurants and pubs in areas worst-hit by coronavirus. They met ministers earlier, with some venting frustration about potential restrictionsappearing in newspapersbefore being announced in Parliament. A tiered system of measures could be introduced next Wednesday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates. The government said it was trying to create ""greater consistency on rules"". There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before, government data showed. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. MPs took part in a video call with health ministers Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar - and England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty - earlier on Thursday. New Covid rules for parts of England 'within days' Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? The chief medical officer presented evidence to the MPs that a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. Yet again, ministers are wrestling with grim trade-offs where no decision is pain-free. But they're also wrestling with a communications challenge: what do you do when newspapers have been briefed that ""Restaurants and pubs in North forced to shut again"", as the Times front page headline reads today, but it hasn't yet been formally decided and announced? Well, a cabinet minister ends up doing a round of interviews where he or she can't answer any of the key questions directly: precisely which parts of the country will be affected by the new regulations, when, for how long, and how severe will they be? Cue noisy grumbles from local leaders in those cities with sky-high infection rates, who don't know what is going to happen. Yes, most of those leaders are Labour politicians not averse to complaining about a Conservative government, but ministers are left with an announcement that appears half-made: the prospect that various businesses may have to close or significantly scale back what they do, but without it being clear which ones, or where. Profound changes affecting millions of people hover as an imminent prospect. But ask a specific question, and the answer is we don't know. Shadow health minister Alex Norris, an MP for Nottingham North - now the city with the highest case numbers in England - told BBC News: ""It was not the most convincing call to be part of."" ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet,' which is hard to understand when I have then talked to local journalists and they are getting better briefings than we are."" He said he understood new restrictions would be coming in next week, adding he believed they should come in immediately ""given we are top of the list now"". Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, who took part in the call, said: ""There are some really challenging circumstances. ""We talked about the North West and North East in particular, where we were talking about - in three weeks' time - having hospitalisation levels higher than in the original peak."" He said ministers had told the MPs to expect new measures to be announced on Monday and implemented on Wednesday. The meeting came amid growing anger among politicians about the way the government has handled new restrictions in parts of the country with high infection rates. Labour's mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC he had been ""having discussions with ministers this week. At no point did somebody say, 'We're closing all hospitality in the north of England on Monday.'"" Former minister Jake Berry, the Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen, has accused the prime minister of enjoying his emergency powers ""a little bit too much"" and of being ""London-centric"". The Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davidson, said in the Commons that the government was ""exactly right to take a localised approach"". But she said the public in some areas of her constituency did not understand why they faced local restrictions when case numbers were low. A slide shown at the meeting lists hospitality as the most frequent setting for coronavirus exposure. Liverpool's Labour Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram, said the ""North should not be a petri dish for experimentation by central government"". MPs have also expressed unease about the ""rule of six"" and the 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants, calling for the scientific rationale behind the measure to be made public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his partywill not be ""voting down"" the curfewnext week, instead saying the rule ""needs to be reformed"". Others on the left of the Labour Party, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell,want a more ""severe"" lockdown,external. One told the BBC they wanted a ""zero Covid approach - hard, fast and backed up by comprehensive testing and financial support"". This video can not be played Cllr David Mellen says a lack of coronavirus restrictions this weekend could mean a âlast chance to party' in Nottingham. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He told the BBC the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". Mr Jenrick added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". The government is expected to introduce anew ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of Englandin an effort to simplify the system and avoid public confusion, the BBC understands. But details of how severe restrictions will be in each tier have yet to be confirmed. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthere were ""whispers in Whitehall of a 'firewall' approach"" to new restrictions,externalexpected next week. This could mean extra limits to be turned on and off again to allow for Christmas, with the possibility of more being introduced in January and February to help the NHS cope. But Laura Kuenssberg said the situation was ""still unclear with so many unknowns"" and final decisions have not been made. The Liberal Democrats have written a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, calling for the furlough scheme to be extended before enforcing any shutdowns of industries, such as hospitality and retail.

"As the Covid crisis has unfolded, infection rates have fluctuated and restrictions have proliferated. But it has always felt that there was one idea to cling to: that by working out which countries were doing well - and which were not - there was something to be learned. After all, historians will surely puzzle over how the countries of Western Europe, with broadly similar economies, produced such drastically different outcomes. So far, at least. We use international comparisons all the time, of course - they're a way of measuring how our own governments are doing. But even comparing the simplest data can be complex. There can be differences in how and when death is reported, how co-morbidities are reflected on death certificates, and for how long after a positive test a death is considered to be Covid-related. All will influence how a country's performance at any given moment is measured. For the moment, the gaps in performance appear to be startling. The death rate in Germany stands at around 11.5 deaths per 100,000 people, while in neighbouring Belgium it's more than seven times higher at 87 per 100,000. France stands somewhere in between at around 48 per 100,000 while the UK is nearer the top of the European table, at 63.3 per 100,000. Each is a prosperous country with a capable health-care system and each has applied broadly similar tools to fight the virus, with  some combination of lockdowns, social distancing and the encouragement of improved hand hygiene bolstered by localised curfews in some cities. But the further you look into the data the harder it becomes to explain the differences. Lombardia and Veneto for example are neighbouring provinces in Northern Italy, but the differences between their experiences are striking - Lombardia's death rate is 167 per 100,000 and Veneto's  43. Tracking the pandemic: Where's been hardest hit? New coronavirus rules country-by-country How the pandemic sparked a European cycling revolution It's perhaps because of the sheer difficulty of explaining the numbers that the view from Germany on whether it is doing better than others is more cautious than you might imagine. One factor, it's acknowledged could be timing - how quickly you take action may be as important as the action you take. The influential German scientist Christian Drosten put it like this ahead of this month's World Health Summit in Berlin: ""There are already speeches celebrating German success but it's not very clear where that comes from. We have moved with exactly the same measures as others. We didn't do anything particularly well, we just did it sooner."" Germany does have an extensive testing system, a well-established network of public health track and trace officials, and a greater number of places in intensive care units than most other countries. But perhaps equally importantly, it has Angela Merkel - one of the few world leaders who is a scientist and who can understand and explain the data herself. At a news conference after meeting with the heads of Germany's regional governments for example Ms Merkel began one answer with the words: ""I simply conducted a model calculation."" She proceeded to talk her audience through the maths of exponential growth in a pandemic, concluding with a warning that Germany would need to take extra measures. She was careful to describe the situation as ""urgent"" but not dramatic. Christian Drosten says a population that feels well-informed is more likely to comply with government instructions or requests. As he put it: ""I'm reading about support rates of 85-90%, that's a huge accomplishmentâ¦everyone knows someone in their own circle who doesn't accept the measures but it's possible to talk to them and that's what we should be doing. I think this is one of the biggest advantages we have in Germany."" Prof Drosten's point is about where science meets society - in other words it's not about the nature of the tools in the toolbox but how the country reacts when the government gets the tools out. We raised this point with Prof Yves Van Laethem, an advisor to the government of Belgium, who said it was possible his government had confused its public by changing messages too quickly and too often. He said there was a need now for sustainable and stable measures as winter approaches, but the appetite of the Belgian people for further changes to regulations was limited - a phenomenon which can also be seen in the UK and elsewhere. ""It's a similar problem in Belgium,"" he says. ""The government proposes something and it gets disputed right awayâ¦.in March and April people were so afraid they were complying and they didn't contest the rules as much. But now people see that as cases are increasing the death rate is remaining low and they wonder why they have to do all these things."" It perhaps explains why Belgium became one of the very few countries to ease a restriction as fears grew of an Autumn second wave. From the end of July it was compulsory in Belgium to wear a mask at all times, in all public spaces, both indoors and out - even if you were walking alone across a deserted park in the middle of the night. From 1 October, that rule has been relaxed. Masks are still compulsory in shops and on public transport, but only in crowded public areas outdoors. By contrast, after months of resisting promoting the use of masks its neighbour, the Netherlands, began tightening its rules, strongly recommending them in shops and on buses. The destination is the same - masks are a good idea in some circumstances, but the direction of travel is very different.  5,895Total number of confirmed deaths in the country 94,283Total number of confirmed cases in the country 57.6The 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 people Those issues of consistency and sustainability have been associated with Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief virologist. His advice to leave bars and restaurants open and not to require mask-wearing was questioned in the first phase of the pandemic, but is increasingly borne out by evidence in the second. It is of course a myth that the Swedish government ""did nothing"" in response to the crisis. It has taken measures to slow the virus including social distancing and the encouragement of extra hand hygiene. Mr Tegnell talks of the importance of ""giving a lot of influence to the population"". Sweden's political culture of calm communitarianism may make the work of the virologist a little easier - and it raises an interesting question about the extent to which outcomes might be determined not just by the measures governments introduce but the reaction to them once they've been announced. If the German and Swedish populations can be trusted - by and large - to accept instructions and requests from their governments then what about those societies where governments are treated more sceptically, where opposition parties, trades unions, populist newspapers and angry local authorities in the worst-affected areas adopt a contrarian or disputatious approach to central power. In France, for example, the national minister for health, Olivier Veran, announced new rules for the populous southern coastal area around Marseille without consulting the local authorities. The mini-lockdown includes the closure of restaurants and bars. The regional president, Renaud Muselier, who is a doctor, described the decision as ""inappropriate, unilateral and brutal"", warning that it would lead to feelings of ""rebellion and revolt"". This is not of course an academic debate about epidemiology. Marseille would see itself as a rival of distant Paris and it would never be difficult to summon a sense of resentment of central power there. But it will be interesting to see what effect - if any - the hostile local reaction to the distant central government will have. There are all sorts of difficulties in making international comparisons at this point in the pandemic - even something as basic as social distancing is complex. France, Germany and the UK for example all have different social distancing measurements - 1m, 1.5m and 2m respectively. But establishing which of those is right and how the balance between risk and convenience was measured will take months, if not years, of study. The problems of making those comparisons struck me when I happened to be spending some time in the Belgian parliament with one of the country's leading politicians on a day when, by coincidence, scientists and politicians in the UK had been praising aspects of Belgium's response to the second wave. He was surprised. ""Honestly,"" he said, ""you can look at the TV every night and see an expert in Stockholm, or in London, or in Paris, say something slightly different. But of course they're all experts. It's too early now for comparison. Maybe that will be possible next year, maybe we'll have to wait until the year after, but not now."" That leaves us perhaps with one conclusion we can safely draw. That health outcomes in this crisis won't ultimately depend merely on what our governments tell us to do and not to do. They'll depend just as much if not more on the choices we choose to make about what we're told.

"Nottingham has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, according to the latest data. Public Health England figures show that 689.1 per 100,000 people tested positive for the virus in the city over the past week. Documents leaked earlier today indicate that new social distancing rules for Nottinghamshire are due to be announced on Monday. Local politicians have criticised the delay in imposing restrictions. Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said the government's lack of action on new measures in Nottingham ""makes absolutely no sense"" and that ""strict interventions are needed urgently"". The Labour politician said: ""The delay leaves this weekend open to potential abuse of the existing rules, which could result in yet more Covid cases in our city."" He called on the government to ""act urgently and decisively or, better still, give us the powers to let us get on with taking action ourselves"". This video can not be played David Mellen says a lack of coronavirus restrictions this weekend could mean a âlast chance to party"" in Nottingham In the week up to 5 October, Nottingham recorded 2,294 cases, up from 407 the previous week. Earlier, the county council said the rate of infection for Nottinghamshire was 106 per 100,000, much lower than the rate in Nottingham. Although the government has yet to introduce formal measures, local authorities have asked people in the county toavoid mixing indoors with other householdsindoors following the ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Nottingham's director of public health Alison Challenger said: ""Everyone needs to stick rigidly to their social bubbles and not mix with other households. ""There is no need to wait for additional government restrictions."" Gedling MP Tom Randall said he would ""wholly support calls"" for people to follow stricter guidelines, while Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood has called the delay in introducing measures ""reckless and indefensible"". Ms Greenwood added: ""It's outrageous that [MPs] only found out about this decision from the media."" On Thursday evening, the government released a statement urging residents to follow ""the advice of the local authority"", as well as practising social distancing, wearing face coverings, and getting tested if they exhibited symptoms. A spokesperson added: ""The local authority has our full backing and support."" But Nottingham North MP Alex Norris, who was briefed about the government's strategy during a call with health minister Edward Argar, said he was sceptical about the government's strategy. He said: ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet', which is very hard to understand. ""They won't support us because they won't bring in the restriction we're appealing for them to bring in. ""We're trying to get ahead of those restrictions by suggesting them to people ourselves, but of course we don't have the legal backing to enforce those."" Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield - which has a lower infection rate of 62.2 - called on the government to reconsider blanket restrictions for the whole of the county. The Conservative politician added: ""It would be really frustrating to have restrictions imposed when, locally, we might not need them."" According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, leaked documents show Nottinghamshire is expected to go into level two of anew ""three-tier"" systemnext week. They indicate people will still be able to go on holiday outside the county, but only with people from their own household or support bubble. Households would still be able to meet indoors if they are in a support bubble. Jo Cox-Brown, founder of Night Time Economy, which works with businesses and local authorities to create safer nights out in English cities, said further restrictions could have a devastating effect on jobs. ""[Businesses] are terrified. The night-time economy is worth 14,000 jobs in Nottingham alone,"" she said. ""They were closed for three months, they have been trading for two months but at 50-75% of normal occupancy levels, so financially these venues are on their knees."" Across England, bars and restaurants could be forced to close as the government prepares to tighten restrictions for the worst-affected areas. It follows the announcement that similar outlets across central Scotland are to be closed for 16 days. Local restrictions have yet to be imposed in the city Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has refused to say whether pubs and restaurants in the north and in Nottingham will be forced to close. He said: ""We are currently considering what steps we should take, obviously taking the advice of our scientific and medical advisers, and a decision will be made shortly."" Asked if there will be an announcement linked to the hospitality industry, he said: ""We are considering the evidence. In some parts of the country, the number of cases are rising very fast and we are taking that very seriously."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Eluned Morgan is minster for mental health, wellbeing and the Welsh language First Minister Mark Drakeford has given some of his health minister's responsibilities to Eluned Morgan in a Welsh Government shake-up.

This is a big change to the health portfolio and moves significant responsibilities away from Health Minister Vaughan Gething. But a Welsh Government source says this is ""absolutely not"" a demotion for him but a ""strengthening of the team"" to deal with the continuing public health emergency that is the Covid pandemic. I'm told this is about emphasising delivery in mental and physical health. In subsuming the international relations brief into the first minister's portfolio it also has the side effect of neutralising criticism that the some of the government focus has been misdirected.

"Supermarket Asda has launched a free NHS drive-through flu jab service for eligible people at 13 UK stores. Anyone entitled to free jabs - such as the elderly, frontline NHS staff, and pregnant women - can use the service. People regarded as non-vulnerable can get jabs for Â£8, which Asda claims is the cheapest on the market. The drive-through jabs will be offered in Asda car parks, and come after reports people are put off visiting GPs and pharmacies due to Covid-19 worries. Asda says the initiative, which began on Thursday, is the first of its kind in the UK. But other retailers, including the Boots and Lloyds Pharmacy chemist chains, also offer jabs. The supermarket's move comes amid news thatflu jabs have been limited by pharmacists and health clinics due to high demand. However, NHS England says enough stocks are available. This year, up to 30 million people can be vaccinated in England, the government says. Maq Din, lead pharmacist at Asda Pharmacy, said: ""The sad truth is that there is an increased mortality risk if you catch Covid-19 when you already have the flu. ""We are putting a number of measures in place at our drive-through flu jab centres , so patients can be assured that it is safe to visit - and they won't even need to leave their car to get a jab. Customers must pre-book, and will be given a time slot and a bay to park when turning up. Asda said its own research had shown that 28% of UK adults said they were currently putting off getting a flu jab over concerns about visiting GPs and pharmacies for fear of coming into contact with someone suffering from Covid-19. The booking procedure is: Find the nearest stores with a pharmacyusing the store locator,external Telephone the store for an appointment - it cannot be booked online During the consultation over the phone, people will be given a time slot and detail The service is available at these Asda stores: Accrington; Bodmin; Eastbourne; Gosport; Hartlepool; Hyde; Nuneaton; Old Kent Road (London); Oldbury; Pilsworth; Sheffield; South Shields; Wakefield Durkar.

Thanks for joining us as we try and make sense of things for you. If youâre catching up with the news, here are some of the headlines from around the world today: We're going to be bringing today's live coverage to an end soon. Here's what has been happening around the UK this Thursday:  A rise of 338,779 new coronavirus infections have been reported globally in the previous 24 hours, the biggest one-day increase since the pandemic began,according to World Health Organization (WHO) data,external. India registered the highest number of new cases with 78,524, followed by 41,906 in Brazil, and 38,904 in the US. The daily global increase in cases breaks the previous record of  330,340, set on 2 October. There were also an extra 5,514 deaths reported worldwide on Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1.05 million, the WHO reports. Rana JawadNorth Africa correspondent, Tunis The mayor of Tunisia's capital, Tunis, has said a night-time curfew will be reinstated for two weeks in a series of restrictions intended to control the spread of coronavirus, which has significantly risen in recent weeks. Since July there were only a few soft measures in place to control the rate of infection in Tunisia. But in the past month alone, more than 20,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The curfew will start on Thursday and run from 21:00 to 05:00 local time on weekdays, and 19:00 to 05:00 local time on weekends. Weekly markets and Friday prayers have also been banned, and cafes and restaurants can no longer have seated areas. The curfew will also be imposed in the neighbouring provinces of Manouba, Ariana, and Ben Arous. Four other cities, which have also seen a significant rise in Covid-19 cases, had already imposed a night curfew. There is a real worry that the countryâs health sector could significantly struggle if the infection rate does not slow down. But the Tunisian government has so far ruled out a return to a nationwide lockdown that was imposed earlier this year. The number of daily Covid-19 cases reported across Canada increased 40% in the last week compared with last, the country's top health official has announced, with the average daily case count hovering at some 2,000 infections. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last month that most of the country had entered its second wave. Canadians are now being encouraged to hunker down and stay home as this next wave worsens. The vast majority of new cases are concentrated in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. On Thursday,  Ontario reported 797 cases of the virus - the highest single day total since the start of the pandemic. The surge in cases comes just days before Canada's Thanksgiving weekend, typically a time for large, indoor family gatherings. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has encouraged residents to celebrate with just your own household this year. ""We're all going to make sacrifices... I know this will be very, very tough,"" he said. There is a âreasonably good chanceâ that an experimental antibody therapy helped President Donald Trump during his treatment for Covid-19, the top infectious diseases expert in the US has said. Dr Anthony Fauci was referring to a drug cocktail made by the company Regeneron. You can read more about this therapy, which mimics the body's immune response to fight the virus,here. In an interview with MSNBC, Dr Fauci said the therapy may have made a âsignificant differenceâ to Trumpâs condition, but warned against calling it a âcureâ, as the president has done. Dr Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also addressed claims President Trump made about the lethality of the flu compared with Covid-19. The health expert said the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 people in the US, is far more serious than seasonal flu. ""There is no doubt about that,"" Fauci said. On WednesdayFacebook removed a post in which Trump made claims to the contrary. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How do monoclonal antibodies work? Asda says it hopes the drive-through service will appeal to people worried about visiting their GP or pharmacy The supermarket Asda has launcheda free NHS drive-through flu vaccination servicefor eligible people at 13 UK stores. Anyone entitled to free jabs - including elderly people, frontline NHS staff and pregnant women - can use the service. People who do not qualify for the free vaccine can get it for Â£8, which Asda claims is the cheapest on the market. It comes after the government said up to 30 million people in England can be vaccinated against flu this year, in an effort to reduce the winter pressure on the NHS as Covid-19 cases rise. Pharmacies have said they face ""unprecedented demand"" and some suspended bookings for anyone outside the vulnerable groups who qualify for a free jab. Amid a new surge in coronavirus cases, New York City will close an additional 61 public schools, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday, bringing the total of newly shuttered schools to 169. They will remain closed until at least 21 October, the mayor said. City and state officials are now scrambling to respond to climbing cases, largely concentrated in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs, imposing strict attendance limits on schools, businesses and places of worship in virus hotspots. This recent crackdown - led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - has been met with outrage among Orthodox Jewish communities, who make up a large proportion of these hard-hit neighbourhoods. On Wednesday, hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men took to the streets for a second night of protests. Many without face coverings, those gathered clashed with police and burned face masks. Over the past week, the city has reported an average of some 566 cases a day - an increase of 61% from the average two weeks earlier, according to data from the New York Times. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The IMF says voluntary social distancing has partly driven the global economic downturn A new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has looked at the extent to which the global economic recession has been driven by voluntary social distancing and lockdown measures. Government restrictions on business and individuals to curb the pandemic come at an economic cost. The IMF research supports that view, but it also found that much of the downturn was due to voluntary social distancing. In other words, people choosing to avoid activities they feared might expose them to the risk of infection. The effect was particularly marked in rich countries where working from home is often more feasible. The report argues that while lockdowns impose short-term costs, they can generate a faster recovery if they lead to lower levels of infection and less voluntary distancing. The report acknowledges that the analysis neglects important side effects of lockdowns, including on educational attainment and mental health. It says these are crucial areas for future research.

On 14 September all four experienced coronavirus symptoms - they'd lost their sense of smell. They were transported by ambulance to a coronavirus quarantine centre at a hotel - 22 days later, three of the girls are still there in solitary confinement.

The French cities of Lyon, Lille, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne will become maximum-alert zones for coronavirus from Saturday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran has announced. The coronavirus alert level was raised to maximum in Parisearlier this week and Marseille last month, leading to the closure of bars and restaurants. ""The situation has deteriorated in several metropolises in recent days,"" Veran said at a news conference on Thursday. âEvery day, more and more people are infected.â He said the alert level could soon be raised to maximum in Toulouse and Montpellier, which are seeing worrying spikes in infections. France's maximum alert level comes into force when the infection rate in a locality exceeds 250 infections per 100,000 people and at least 30% of intensive care beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients. Minutes before Vernan made his announcement, French health authorities reported 18,129 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, slightly lower than Wednesday's all-time high of 18,746 daily cases. Infections have risen rapidly since the end of summer in France, a trend seen across Europe as winter approaches. It's early evening in the UK. Here are the latest coronavirus news updates Masks are now mandatory in outdoor spaces in Italy Italy has recorded 4,458 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the biggest daily rise since mid-April when the country was under a national lockdown. It is the steepest 24-hour rise since 12 April, when 4,694 new infections were reported,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external. The Italian government managed to bring its coronavirus epidemic under control by imposing one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world from March. That lockdown inflicted heavy economic costs, but allowed the government to reopen restaurants, bars and shops by summer. But the virus is spreading once again, albeit at a steadier rate than during the first wave of the pandemic. On Thursday,the government made it mandatory to wear face masks in outdoor spacesto contain the spread of the coronavirus. People arriving in England from the Greek islands of Lesvos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos and Zakynthos will no longer need to self-isolate for 14 days from Saturday, the government has announced. The islands have been added to the list of travel corridors for England having been assessed by the Joint Biosecurity Centre as posing a lower infection risk. The quarantine rule for the islands will be lifted at 04:00 on 10 October. Zakynthos was the subject of controversy in August following reports of outbreaks in resorts popular with British tourists and after several clusters of Covid-19 infections were traced to UK-bound flights from the island. Kennedy and Nixon debated with 4,828km (3,000 miles) between them in 1960 As we reported earlier, US presidential debate organisers have decided to change the format of the next TV clash between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, opting for a virtual rather than an in-person event. Trump has scoffed at the proposal, dismissing the idea of a virtual debate as âridiculousâ. However, the format was acceptable to two former presidents, Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy, when they were vying for the White House in 1960. There was no coronavirus then, of course. But in their third debate of the campaign, Nixon and Kennedy went head-to-head, albeit via video link from different cities on the west and east coasts of the US. ""The two candidates will not be sharing the same platform,"" moderator Bill Shadel said when opening the debate. ""In New York, the Democratic presidential nominee Senator John F Kennedy. Separated by 3,000 miles, in a Los Angeles studio, the Republican presidential nominee Vice-President Richard M Nixon."" American TV network C-SPANhas a recording of the debate on its website,external. Thursday's number of new coronavirus cases in the UK, 17,540, is an increase of more than 3,000 on Wednesday, when 14,162 were recorded. There were also a further 77 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, seven more than the day before. Hospitalisations across the UK rose by nearly 100 on Sunday 4 October, meaning they are now doubling roughly every two weeks, according to BBC News head of statistics Robert Cuffe. In England, 368 people with Covid-19 were recorded as being on a ventilator in hospital on Wednesday. On the previous Wednesday, 285 people were recorded as needing ventilation in England. People in Northern Ireland caught breaching coronavirus regulations will now face a minimum fine of Â£200 under plans agreed by the executive. It is understood ministers have signed off on proposals brought by Justice Minister Naomi Long. At present, fixed penalty notices start at Â£60, but can rise to Â£960 for repeat offenders. There are also changes planned around mandatory face coverings. Read morehere. Scientists are developing vaccines at break-neck speed A senior official in the Trump administration has said there will be enough vaccines against coronavirus for âevery Americanâ who wants one by March to April of 2021. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said up to 100 million doses of a vaccine could be ready by the yearâs end. âThe good news is that we're doing everything we can to ensure that we have supplies manufactured,â Azar said at a Goldman Sachs Healthcare virtual conference on Thursday. There are around 40 different coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials around the world.

"New measures to tackle coronavirus are to be announced ""in the coming days"", a minister says, after the BBC was told pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas of England. There could also be a ban on overnight stays away from home in the locations  - which include the North and Midlands. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the government was ""currently considering what steps to take"". Athree-tier system for local lockdownsis also likely to be announced. Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made and a formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. It comes as North of England and Midlands MPs have beenbriefed by health ministers and chief medical officerChris Whitty about the latest coronavirus data. The number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 17,540 - an increase of 3,378 on Wednesday's figures - with a further 77 deaths reported. Some politicians in the North of England and the Midlandshave shared their frustration about the plans appearing in newspapers before being announced in Parliament. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC: ""If it's urgent, give us the detail, give us the evidence behind the proposals. Let's discuss it and let's agree it quickly."" Check the Covid rules where you live What is the risk of Covid overwhelming the NHS? Do local lockdowns stop the spread of Covid? London local lockdown 'unlikely this week' Further 1,600 students test positive for Covid Meanwhile, Labour has challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 BST closing time for pubs and restaurants in England. Leader Sir Keir Starmersaid his party would not be ""voting down"" the measure in the Commons next Tuesdaybut the policy ""needs to be reformed"". Downing Street said that early data suggested a ""significant proportion"" of coronavirus exposure was seen in the hospitality sector, especially in younger age groups. But pressed on whether the government would publish evidence on the issue, Mr Jenrick told the BBC: ""It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. ""The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules."" He added that it was right to ""take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge"". On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick did not rule out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He added the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with the Academy of Medical Colleges warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Nottingham, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in England, according to the latest Public Health England data. From Friday,all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland,including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. But industry leaders are warningthe measures could be the final straw for many businesses. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? SOCIAL LIFE:What are the rules when I go to the pub? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? Health minister Nadine Dorriestweeted,externalthat further measures were needed in England because hospital admissions could be at ""a critical stage"" in about 10 days' time. A government source told the BBC the situation in the North West and North East of England was ""very troubling"", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care. These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions - with an announcement possibly on Monday - in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. There remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland. The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the North East and North West of England, Birmingham and Leicester- including on households mixing. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the hospitality industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and Â£2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support.

"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted Five police officers are facing an investigation over the stop and search of British athlete Bianca Williams and her partner in west London. Ms Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, whose baby son was in the car, believe they were racially profiled when they were stopped in Maida Vale, on 4 July. The Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after footage was widely shared. Sal Naseem said a ""threshold for a misconduct investigation"" had been met. The IOPC's regional director added: ""Decisions on any further action will only be made once our investigation is complete."" The Met had said officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Ms Williams, 26, accused the Met of racially profiling her partner, who was driving a black Mercedes. Three days after the incident,the Met apologised to Ms Williams. Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 The force also referred itself to the IOPC, despite two reviews by the force's directorate of professional standards concluding there had been no misconduct. The five officers will now be investigated for potential breaches of police standards of professional behaviour relating to use of force; duties and responsibilities; and authority, respect and courtesy, the IOPC said in a statement. The IOPC said its independent investigation would focus on seven points including why Mr Dos Santos's car was followed and stopped and whether the force used against Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams was lawful, necessary, reasonable and proportionate. It is also being questioned why a Merlin report, a Met-run database that stores information on children who have become known to the police for any reason, was created for Ms Williams's son. Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car Investigators will also look at whether Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos ""were treated less favourably because of their race"" as well as the accuracy of the accounts provided by the officers and the ""appropriateness of the communications"" issued by the Met. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? Met refers British sprinter stop-and-search Williams' 'heart hurts' after police stop car The IOPC statement said it would look at whether there were grounds for Mr Dos Santos to be kept in handcuffs after he had been searched. It added: ""In relation to Ms Williams the potential breaches, which will all be thoroughly investigated, include taking hold of her without first having sought her co-operation with the search; handcuffing her initially and continuing to handcuff her after she had been searched; her continued detention and whether there were grounds to do so.""

"MPs from the Midlands and northern England are calling for more detail on possible plans to close restaurants and pubs in areas worst-hit by coronavirus. They met ministers earlier, with some venting frustration about potential restrictionsappearing in newspapersbefore being announced in Parliament. A tiered system of measures could be introduced next Wednesday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates. The government said it was trying to create ""greater consistency on rules"". There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before, government data showed. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. MPs took part in a video call with health ministers Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar - and England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty - earlier on Thursday. New Covid rules for parts of England 'within days' Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? The chief medical officer presented evidence to the MPs that a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. Yet again, ministers are wrestling with grim trade-offs where no decision is pain-free. But they're also wrestling with a communications challenge: what do you do when newspapers have been briefed that ""Restaurants and pubs in North forced to shut again"", as the Times front page headline reads today, but it hasn't yet been formally decided and announced? Well, a cabinet minister ends up doing a round of interviews where he or she can't answer any of the key questions directly: precisely which parts of the country will be affected by the new regulations, when, for how long, and how severe will they be? Cue noisy grumbles from local leaders in those cities with sky-high infection rates, who don't know what is going to happen. Yes, most of those leaders are Labour politicians not averse to complaining about a Conservative government, but ministers are left with an announcement that appears half-made: the prospect that various businesses may have to close or significantly scale back what they do, but without it being clear which ones, or where. Profound changes affecting millions of people hover as an imminent prospect. But ask a specific question, and the answer is we don't know. Shadow health minister Alex Norris, an MP for Nottingham North - now the city with the highest case numbers in England - told BBC News: ""It was not the most convincing call to be part of."" ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet,' which is hard to understand when I have then talked to local journalists and they are getting better briefings than we are."" He said he understood new restrictions would be coming in next week, adding he believed they should come in immediately ""given we are top of the list now"". Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, who took part in the call, said: ""There are some really challenging circumstances. ""We talked about the North West and North East in particular, where we were talking about - in three weeks' time - having hospitalisation levels higher than in the original peak."" He said ministers had told the MPs to expect new measures to be announced on Monday and implemented on Wednesday. The meeting came amid growing anger among politicians about the way the government has handled new restrictions in parts of the country with high infection rates. Labour's mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC he had been ""having discussions with ministers this week. At no point did somebody say, 'We're closing all hospitality in the north of England on Monday.'"" Former minister Jake Berry, the Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen, has accused the prime minister of enjoying his emergency powers ""a little bit too much"" and of being ""London-centric"". The Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davidson, said in the Commons that the government was ""exactly right to take a localised approach"". But she said the public in some areas of her constituency did not understand why they faced local restrictions when case numbers were low. A slide shown at the meeting lists hospitality as the most frequent setting for coronavirus exposure. Liverpool's Labour Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram, said the ""North should not be a petri dish for experimentation by central government"". MPs have also expressed unease about the ""rule of six"" and the 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants, calling for the scientific rationale behind the measure to be made public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his partywill not be ""voting down"" the curfewnext week, instead saying the rule ""needs to be reformed"". Others on the left of the Labour Party, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell,want a more ""severe"" lockdown,external. One told the BBC they wanted a ""zero Covid approach - hard, fast and backed up by comprehensive testing and financial support"". This video can not be played Cllr David Mellen says a lack of coronavirus restrictions this weekend could mean a âlast chance to party' in Nottingham. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He told the BBC the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". Mr Jenrick added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". The government is expected to introduce anew ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of Englandin an effort to simplify the system and avoid public confusion, the BBC understands. But details of how severe restrictions will be in each tier have yet to be confirmed. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthere were ""whispers in Whitehall of a 'firewall' approach"" to new restrictions,externalexpected next week. This could mean extra limits to be turned on and off again to allow for Christmas, with the possibility of more being introduced in January and February to help the NHS cope. But Laura Kuenssberg said the situation was ""still unclear with so many unknowns"" and final decisions have not been made. The Liberal Democrats have written a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, calling for the furlough scheme to be extended before enforcing any shutdowns of industries, such as hospitality and retail.

"This year's Nobel Prize for Literature has been awarded to the US poet Louise GlÃ¼ck. GlÃ¼ck was recognised for ""her unmistakable poetic voice, that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal"" said the Swedish Academy, which oversees the award. The Academy added she was ""surprised"" when she received their phone call. GlÃ¼ck, born 1943 in New York, lives in Massachusetts and is also professor of English at Yale University. The Academy's permanent secretary Mats Malm said he had spoken to GlÃ¼ck just before making the announcement. ""The message came as a surprise, but a welcome one as far as I could tell,"" he said. In 2016 she received the National Humanities Medal from former US President Barack Obama She isthe fourth woman to win the prize for literature since 2010,external, and only the 16th since the Nobel prizes were first awarded in 1901. The last American to win wasBob Dylan in 2016. GlÃ¼ck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for her collection The Wild Iris and the National Book Award in 2014. Her other honours include the 2001 Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the Wallace Stevens Award, given in 2008, and a National Humanities Medal, awarded in 2015. She was also editor of the anthology The Best American Poetry 1993. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Her poetry focuses on the painful reality of being human, dealing with themes such as death, childhood, and family life. She also takes inspiration from Greek mythology and its characters, such as Persephone and Eurydice, who are often the victims of betrayal. The Academy said her 2006 collection Averno was a ""masterly collection, a visionary interpretation of the myth of Persephone's descent into Hell in the captivity of Hades, the god of death"". Olga Tokarczuk won for 2018 and Peter Handke was 2019's winner The chair of the Nobel prize committee, Anders Olsson, also praised the poet's ""candid and uncompromising"" voice, which is ""full of humour and biting wit"". Her 12 collections of poetry are ""characterised by a striving for clarity"", he added, comparing her with Emily Dickinson with her ""severity and unwillingness to accept simple tenets of faith"". The prize is given to the person who has ""produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"". Even in their own country, few poets achieve true fame with the public in their own lifetime. But Louise GlÃ¼ck has been awarded almost every prize an American poet might hope for. Among many other awards she took a Los Angeles Times Book Prize and spent a year as America's poet laureate in 2003/4 - though perhaps with a degree of reluctance at first. Louise GlÃ¼ck (it's pronounced Glick) has made clear she sees herself as a private person. When she was given the Poet Laureateship she told the Boston Globe newspaper: ""I have very little taste for public life."" She added that she had thought she wasn't ""the sort of person they'd ever look at"". Her first volume of verse - Firstborn - came out in 1968. Many of her works since have dealt with human emotion, childhood and the nature of life - often family life. To sample her work, head for the short lyric Nostos (a Greek term meaning Homecoming). The first lines are characteristic, being about memory: There was an apple tree in the yard â this would have been forty years ago... And the powerful last lines state one of her strongest beliefs: We look at the world once, in childhood. The rest is memory. Her collection Ararat was described in the New York Times a few years ago as ""the most brutal and sorrow-filled book of American poetry published in the last 25 years"".  Sadness and grief are certainly a frequent part of what she writes - yet she's seldom a depressing writer. GlÃ¼ck's name was not widely touted this year as a possible Nobel laureate. Until now she has not been much read outside the US. At the age of 77, GlÃ¼ck can look forward to many new readers - and they can look forward to discovering a poet of insight and humanity. Last year's choice of Austrian novelist Peter Handkeled to wide criticism. Handke was a known supporter of the Serbs during the 1990s Yugoslav war and spoke atthe funeral of former Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,external, who was accused of genocide and other war crimes. Last year also saw Polish author Olga Tokarczukbelatedly announced as the winner of the 2018 literature prizewhich had been suspended for a year after a sexual assault scandal and financial misconduct allegations rocked the Academy. Normally, winners receive their Nobel from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, but the pandemic means it has been replaced with a televised ceremony showing the laureates receiving their awards in their home countries.

The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the hospitality industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and Â£2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support.

"Local councils in England will receive Â£30m to fund measures including Covid marshals, to ensure the public and businesses follow coronavirus rules. A further Â£30m in government funding will be split between police forces in England and Wales to aid enforcement. Marshals will not have powers to enforce the law but will advise people on how to follow the rules, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said. The Local Government Association warned authorities are at ""tipping point"". The government said the funding would help step up enforcement of coronavirus rules in a bid to tackle the rise of infections. Covid marshals 'unlikely' in England, councils say 'Nobody knows' how Covid marshals plan will work Who are the Covid marshals and what are their powers? Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Covid marshals could knock on doors, as they had done in places such as Leicester, but would not be able to enter properties. He said: ""They won't have the power to enforce the law so if there are particularly egregious examples they would need to escalate that to the police and I think that is the right thing to do. We are not expecting local council officers to get involved in that."" Some of the funding will go towards environmental health officers who do have enforcement powers to ensure businesses obey the restrictions, Mr Jenrick said. He said he expected the funding to be ""used sensitively to help to educate, inform and engage members of the public"". Nesil Caliskan, from the Local Government Association (LGA), welcomed the funding, but said in many areas regulatory services are already ""at tipping point"". He said with councils leading local work to tackle Covid-19 the government needed to ensure they had the funding to maintain ""vital trading standards and environmental health services over the next six months and beyond"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? SOCIAL LIFE:What are the rules when I go to the pub? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? The additional funding for police forces comes after calls from Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), for more support for ""specific Covid patrolling activity"". NPCC figures showed that after a 28% drop in crime at the height of lockdown, in the four weeks to 30 August levels were at 3% below those in the same period last year. Mr Hewitt said: ""This additional funding will go some way to covering the cost of this at a time when crime and demand on policing is almost back to the levels seen before the pandemic."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government had been clear with infections rising ""we will not allow a small minority of people to reverse our hard-won progress"" and said the funding would strengthen the police's role in enforcing the law. John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said officers must keep their discretion about how best to use resources with forces already ""overstretched"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the funding was not enough for forces and councils already under pressure even before the pandemic. ""They have come under huge strain, not least as they went into this crisis weakened by a decade of cuts that saw officer numbers fall and council funding slashed,"" he said. The Home Office has also launched a scheme to allow police forces to recover losses due to the pandemic from income generating work, such as policing sporting events. They will be able to recoup 75p in every Â£1 of budgeted income after absorbing 5% of the losses.

"MPs from the Midlands and northern England are calling for more detail on possible plans to close restaurants and pubs in areas worst-hit by coronavirus. They met ministers earlier, with some venting frustration about potential restrictionsappearing in newspapersbefore being announced in Parliament. A tiered system of measures could be introduced next Wednesday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates. The government said it was trying to create ""greater consistency on rules"". There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before, government data showed. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. MPs took part in a video call with health ministers Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar - and England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty - earlier on Thursday. New Covid rules for parts of England 'within days' Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? The chief medical officer presented evidence to the MPs that a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. Yet again, ministers are wrestling with grim trade-offs where no decision is pain-free. But they're also wrestling with a communications challenge: what do you do when newspapers have been briefed that ""Restaurants and pubs in North forced to shut again"", as the Times front page headline reads today, but it hasn't yet been formally decided and announced? Well, a cabinet minister ends up doing a round of interviews where he or she can't answer any of the key questions directly: precisely which parts of the country will be affected by the new regulations, when, for how long, and how severe will they be? Cue noisy grumbles from local leaders in those cities with sky-high infection rates, who don't know what is going to happen. Yes, most of those leaders are Labour politicians not averse to complaining about a Conservative government, but ministers are left with an announcement that appears half-made: the prospect that various businesses may have to close or significantly scale back what they do, but without it being clear which ones, or where. Profound changes affecting millions of people hover as an imminent prospect. But ask a specific question, and the answer is we don't know. Shadow health minister Alex Norris, an MP for Nottingham North - now the city with the highest case numbers in England - told BBC News: ""It was not the most convincing call to be part of."" ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet,' which is hard to understand when I have then talked to local journalists and they are getting better briefings than we are."" He said he understood new restrictions would be coming in next week, adding he believed they should come in immediately ""given we are top of the list now"". Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, who took part in the call, said: ""There are some really challenging circumstances. ""We talked about the North West and North East in particular, where we were talking about - in three weeks' time - having hospitalisation levels higher than in the original peak."" He said ministers had told the MPs to expect new measures to be announced on Monday and implemented on Wednesday. The meeting came amid growing anger among politicians about the way the government has handled new restrictions in parts of the country with high infection rates. Labour's mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC he had been ""having discussions with ministers this week. At no point did somebody say, 'We're closing all hospitality in the north of England on Monday.'"" Former minister Jake Berry, the Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen, has accused the prime minister of enjoying his emergency powers ""a little bit too much"" and of being ""London-centric"". The Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davidson, said in the Commons that the government was ""exactly right to take a localised approach"". But she said the public in some areas of her constituency did not understand why they faced local restrictions when case numbers were low. A slide shown at the meeting lists hospitality as the most frequent setting for coronavirus exposure. Liverpool's Labour Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram, said the ""North should not be a petri dish for experimentation by central government"". MPs have also expressed unease about the ""rule of six"" and the 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants, calling for the scientific rationale behind the measure to be made public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his partywill not be ""voting down"" the curfewnext week, instead saying the rule ""needs to be reformed"". Others on the left of the Labour Party, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell,want a more ""severe"" lockdown,external. One told the BBC they wanted a ""zero Covid approach - hard, fast and backed up by comprehensive testing and financial support"". This video can not be played Cllr David Mellen says a lack of coronavirus restrictions this weekend could mean a âlast chance to party' in Nottingham. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He told the BBC the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". Mr Jenrick added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". The government is expected to introduce anew ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of Englandin an effort to simplify the system and avoid public confusion, the BBC understands. But details of how severe restrictions will be in each tier have yet to be confirmed. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthere were ""whispers in Whitehall of a 'firewall' approach"" to new restrictions,externalexpected next week. This could mean extra limits to be turned on and off again to allow for Christmas, with the possibility of more being introduced in January and February to help the NHS cope. But Laura Kuenssberg said the situation was ""still unclear with so many unknowns"" and final decisions have not been made. The Liberal Democrats have written a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, calling for the furlough scheme to be extended before enforcing any shutdowns of industries, such as hospitality and retail.

"Caroline Langton opted to move to Ramsgate rather than east London Caroline Langton was on the cusp of exchanging on a flat in East London earlier this year - and then came the coronavirus lockdown. Instead, she ended up buying a property in Ramsgate near the sea. She's not alone - property website Rightmove says homebuyers are looking to escape crowded cities and big towns by moving to the country or the coast. Coronavirus has meant more people are working from home while lockdown made them realise they wanted more space. Rightmove said that searches have doubled for homes in small towns and villages with populations less than 11,000. For Ms Langton, the pandemic ""changed everything"". She was renting a property in Margate as she and a friend were just about to exchange on a flat in Leyton, East London when the lockdown began in March. It made her think again about moving to the capital. ""In Margate you've got that huge panoramic beach, and you get that sense of space, which you just don't get in London,"" she says. ""Living with a friend in a small property wasn't the best idea,"" she adds, especially as both potential flatmates have partners. Instead, Ms Langton decided to buy a property in Ramsgate. The economics added up. To get a small two-bedroom flat in Leyton would have cost twice as much as a bigger place in Ramsgate. Buying next to the sea also worked for her job as co-founder of an interior planting design company which can deal with clients remotely. According to Rightmove, seaside resorts have seen the biggest rise in sales, as people sought more space during lockdown. ""The desire to move to the country has turned into a trend from a short-term shift,"" said Rightmove's Tim Bannister. ""Back in May when the market reopened in England we wondered how long the desire to move to the country or to smaller towns and villages would last."" House prices at all-time high, says Nationwide Mini house-buying boom leads to highest ever monthly price He said there are two main reasons for the trend: some buyers are more willing to have a country commute a few times a week, while others are preparing for social distancing to be here for some time and so are being drawn to places with more outdoor space. But anyone buying now should expect prices to be lower next year, estate agents have warned. The latest RICS UK Residential Survey has revealed expectations that prices will move into negative territory over the next 12 months. ""There is increasing concern that the combination of significant job losses over the coming months allied to the scaling back of policy initiatives in early 2021 will have an adverse impact on transaction levels,"" warned Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Fancy moving to a coastal cottage? However, despite warning of negative prices next year, RICS reported strong house sales in September. Halifax reported earlier in the week that house prices jumped by 7.3% in September - the strongest annual increase since June 2016. It took the average UK house price to just below quarter of a million pounds, at Â£249,870, Halifax said. These reports encapsulate the difference between vision and reality for many potential homebuyers. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic priorities, with space inside and out becoming more attractive for some than the buzz of a town or city. But actually making that move may not be so easy. Demand may not be matched by countryside properties coming on the market - whether it be a two-bedroom terrace or a detached property in its own grounds. Then there is the question of how easy it is to sell an existing urban home, particularly during dark autumn and winter months. On top of that, lenders are restricting mortgages for those without lots of equity, to reduce their own exposure to an economic downturn. And, as always, jobs and pay are key in giving people the confidence and financial security to move - and with heavy redundancies on the cards, that may slow activity in the housing sector. According to Rightmove, searches for properties in nine areas in England have doubled, and all have populations under 11,000. Searches for homes in Lightwater in Surrey have risen the most - up 130% in the past year. The village has a population of less than 7,000 people, and house prices range from a studio flat on offer for Â£155,000 to a five-bed house with an asking price of more than Â£3.6m. Other small villages and market towns have proved popular with searches up 128% for Bruton in Somerset and up 111% for Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. The other locations where searches have doubled are: Hungerford, Berkshire Sturminster Newton, Dorset Aylesford, Kent Shaftesbury, Dorset Halesworth, Suffolk and Dartmouth, Devon. The latter harbour town also tops the table for the biggest increase in the number of sales agreed, up by 179% in the past year. St Ives in Cornwall posted a 170% rise in sales with Buckhurst Hill, Essex up 164% and Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire up 156%.

"Local councils in England will receive Â£30m to fund measures including Covid marshals, to ensure the public and businesses follow coronavirus rules. A further Â£30m in government funding will be split between police forces in England and Wales to aid enforcement. Marshals will not have powers to enforce the law but will advise people on how to follow the rules, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said. The Local Government Association warned authorities are at ""tipping point"". The government said the funding would help step up enforcement of coronavirus rules in a bid to tackle the rise of infections. Covid marshals 'unlikely' in England, councils say 'Nobody knows' how Covid marshals plan will work Who are the Covid marshals and what are their powers? Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Covid marshals could knock on doors, as they had done in places such as Leicester, but would not be able to enter properties. He said: ""They won't have the power to enforce the law so if there are particularly egregious examples they would need to escalate that to the police and I think that is the right thing to do. We are not expecting local council officers to get involved in that."" Some of the funding will go towards environmental health officers who do have enforcement powers to ensure businesses obey the restrictions, Mr Jenrick said. He said he expected the funding to be ""used sensitively to help to educate, inform and engage members of the public"". Nesil Caliskan, from the Local Government Association (LGA), welcomed the funding, but said in many areas regulatory services are already ""at tipping point"". He said with councils leading local work to tackle Covid-19 the government needed to ensure they had the funding to maintain ""vital trading standards and environmental health services over the next six months and beyond"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? SOCIAL LIFE:What are the rules when I go to the pub? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? The additional funding for police forces comes after calls from Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), for more support for ""specific Covid patrolling activity"". NPCC figures showed that after a 28% drop in crime at the height of lockdown, in the four weeks to 30 August levels were at 3% below those in the same period last year. Mr Hewitt said: ""This additional funding will go some way to covering the cost of this at a time when crime and demand on policing is almost back to the levels seen before the pandemic."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government had been clear with infections rising ""we will not allow a small minority of people to reverse our hard-won progress"" and said the funding would strengthen the police's role in enforcing the law. John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said officers must keep their discretion about how best to use resources with forces already ""overstretched"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the funding was not enough for forces and councils already under pressure even before the pandemic. ""They have come under huge strain, not least as they went into this crisis weakened by a decade of cuts that saw officer numbers fall and council funding slashed,"" he said. The Home Office has also launched a scheme to allow police forces to recover losses due to the pandemic from income generating work, such as policing sporting events. They will be able to recoup 75p in every Â£1 of budgeted income after absorbing 5% of the losses.

"Caroline Langton opted to move to Ramsgate rather than east London Caroline Langton was on the cusp of exchanging on a flat in East London earlier this year - and then came the coronavirus lockdown. Instead, she ended up buying a property in Ramsgate near the sea. She's not alone - property website Rightmove says homebuyers are looking to escape crowded cities and big towns by moving to the country or the coast. Coronavirus has meant more people are working from home while lockdown made them realise they wanted more space. Rightmove said that searches have doubled for homes in small towns and villages with populations less than 11,000. For Ms Langton, the pandemic ""changed everything"". She was renting a property in Margate as she and a friend were just about to exchange on a flat in Leyton, East London when the lockdown began in March. It made her think again about moving to the capital. ""In Margate you've got that huge panoramic beach, and you get that sense of space, which you just don't get in London,"" she says. ""Living with a friend in a small property wasn't the best idea,"" she adds, especially as both potential flatmates have partners. Instead, Ms Langton decided to buy a property in Ramsgate. The economics added up. To get a small two-bedroom flat in Leyton would have cost twice as much as a bigger place in Ramsgate. Buying next to the sea also worked for her job as co-founder of an interior planting design company which can deal with clients remotely. According to Rightmove, seaside resorts have seen the biggest rise in sales, as people sought more space during lockdown. ""The desire to move to the country has turned into a trend from a short-term shift,"" said Rightmove's Tim Bannister. ""Back in May when the market reopened in England we wondered how long the desire to move to the country or to smaller towns and villages would last."" House prices at all-time high, says Nationwide Mini house-buying boom leads to highest ever monthly price He said there are two main reasons for the trend: some buyers are more willing to have a country commute a few times a week, while others are preparing for social distancing to be here for some time and so are being drawn to places with more outdoor space. But anyone buying now should expect prices to be lower next year, estate agents have warned. The latest RICS UK Residential Survey has revealed expectations that prices will move into negative territory over the next 12 months. ""There is increasing concern that the combination of significant job losses over the coming months allied to the scaling back of policy initiatives in early 2021 will have an adverse impact on transaction levels,"" warned Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Fancy moving to a coastal cottage? However, despite warning of negative prices next year, RICS reported strong house sales in September. Halifax reported earlier in the week that house prices jumped by 7.3% in September - the strongest annual increase since June 2016. It took the average UK house price to just below quarter of a million pounds, at Â£249,870, Halifax said. These reports encapsulate the difference between vision and reality for many potential homebuyers. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic priorities, with space inside and out becoming more attractive for some than the buzz of a town or city. But actually making that move may not be so easy. Demand may not be matched by countryside properties coming on the market - whether it be a two-bedroom terrace or a detached property in its own grounds. Then there is the question of how easy it is to sell an existing urban home, particularly during dark autumn and winter months. On top of that, lenders are restricting mortgages for those without lots of equity, to reduce their own exposure to an economic downturn. And, as always, jobs and pay are key in giving people the confidence and financial security to move - and with heavy redundancies on the cards, that may slow activity in the housing sector. According to Rightmove, searches for properties in nine areas in England have doubled, and all have populations under 11,000. Searches for homes in Lightwater in Surrey have risen the most - up 130% in the past year. The village has a population of less than 7,000 people, and house prices range from a studio flat on offer for Â£155,000 to a five-bed house with an asking price of more than Â£3.6m. Other small villages and market towns have proved popular with searches up 128% for Bruton in Somerset and up 111% for Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. The other locations where searches have doubled are: Hungerford, Berkshire Sturminster Newton, Dorset Aylesford, Kent Shaftesbury, Dorset Halesworth, Suffolk and Dartmouth, Devon. The latter harbour town also tops the table for the biggest increase in the number of sales agreed, up by 179% in the past year. St Ives in Cornwall posted a 170% rise in sales with Buckhurst Hill, Essex up 164% and Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire up 156%.

"The prize launched by Sir David and Prince William is looking for ""brilliant"" projects to save the planet Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have joined forces to launch what they hope will become the ""Nobel Prize for environmentalism"". They say the search is on for 50 solutions to the world's gravest environmental problems by 2030. With Â£50m to be awarded over a decade, the ""Earthshot Prize"" is the biggest environmental prize ever. The Prince said ""positivity"" had been missing from the climate debate - something the award could supply. ""The Earthshot prize is really about harnessing that optimism and that urgency to find some of the world's solutions to some of the greatest environmental problems,"" he told the BBC. Anyone could win,he explained, as he called for ""amazing people"" to create ""brilliant innovative projects"". These, he said, could help save the planet. To mark the event BBC Radio 4's Today Programmehas secured an unprecedented exclusive joint interviewwith the Prince and Sir David. Attenborough: 'Curb excess capitalism' to save nature Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' This video can not be played Prince William launches the Earthshot Prize During the conversation Prince William said the launch of the new prize marks the moment he takes up the baton of environmental campaigning from his father. ""I feel right now it's my responsibility"", he said. The world is ""at a tipping point"", explained the Prince, who said the Earthshot Prize is his and Sir David's effort to ensure we hand the planet on to our children and grandchildren ""in a better state than we found it."" Nick Robinson quoted a Today interview with Prince Charles in which he had said sometimes his ideas on the environment were regarded as a bit ""dotty"". ""Was there a time when even you, I wonder, thought, what's my father banging on about?"", Mr Robinson asked the Prince. ""I regularly wonder what my father's banging on about. I'm sure every son thinks the same,"" Prince William replied. ""He's talked about this for a long time and long before people sort of cottoned on to climate change. So, I've always listened to and learnt and believed in what he was saying."" ""I think the dotty person now would be the person who doesn't believe in climate change,"" the Prince added. The Earthshot Prize will make five awards of Â£1m each year for 10 years. These ""Earthshots"" are intended as ""universal goals to repair our planet by 2030"" and will go to the best and most innovative ideas to help: Protect and restore nature Clean our air Revive our oceans Build a waste-free world â¢Fix our climate ""We hope that this Earthshot Prize reaches everyone around the world,"" the Prince told Radio 4. ""From communities, schools, right up to banks, governments, corporations - anyone and everyone is a part of this and anyone could find the solutions that we need."" Even suggestions that ""may sound crackpot"" are welcome, added Sir David, so long as they have the potential to make a difference on what he called ""the world scale"". The aim is to find ""new solutions"" that have a positive effect on environmental change and improve living standards globally, particularly those communities most at risk from climate change. ""There's a lot of people wanting to do many good things in the environment and what they need is a bit of a catalyst, a bit of hope, a bit of positivity that we can actually fix what's being presented"", Prince William said. The prize could go to a new technology, a new way of doing things or a new policy - basically any good idea. Individuals, community groups, scientists, activists, economists, leaders, government, banks, businesses, cities and even countries are welcome to submit their ideas to a nominating organisation. Coral bleaching is a major problem for the oceans - one of the prize categories The ""Earthshot"" name was chosen to echo the so-called ""Moonshot"": the huge US project to get the first person on the moon back in the 1960s when John F Kennedy was president. Prince William and Sir David Attenborough believe a similarly focussed effort - but this time global - is needed now to tackle environmental issues. The need for action never been more urgent, Sir David warned. ""Suddenly we actually see the writing is on the wall,"" he told Radio 4. We are already seeing the coral reefs dying, forests disappearing, the North Pole beginning to melt, he said. ""People can see it's happening and it is a matter of great urgency now."" Sir David said the aim is that the prize will give ideas ""that strength, that financial impetus to spread and be developed.""

Nominations will open on 1 November 2020 with an annual awards ceremony to be held in a different city each year, starting with London in autumn 2021. The Â£1m on offer is designed as an incentive for people to apply, but don't think you can book yourself a Caribbean holiday or buy yourself a Lamborghini if you win, the money must be spent on developing your idea and trying to get it taken up around the world. Prince William and Sir David will be joined on an ""Earthshot Prize Council"" by celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, sport, business, charity and the environment. They will act as ambassadors, giving publicity to the prize and its winners and helping motivate people around the world to environmental action. Meanwhile a coalition of individuals, businesses and organisations have provided the money for the prize and will help maximise the impact of the winners' ideas. Human-made fires designed to clear the Brazilian rainforest for cattle and crops ""Do you have a sense of how this fight can go on when you're no longer here?"" Mr Robinson asked Sir David, who celebrated his 94th birthday in May. The broadcaster said he believed there has been a global change in attitude to environmental issues. These days people don't just see it as a ""cranky, harmless interest"" but as ""a life and death issue."" ""The disaster we are facing is on a scale that has not been seen since mankind existed,"" Sir David said. Prince William said he aimed to take up the environmental baton from his father Prince Charles Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have set themselves the dizzyingly ambitious goal of ""repairing the planet by 2030"". So where will the potentially planet-saving ideas they want come from? The answer is we just don't know - you might have an idea that, with a bit of publicity and cash, could reshape our world. Which is why awarding prizes can be so effective: we can all apply. This video can not be played The renowned broadcaster says the excesses of capitalism must be ""curbed"" to help nature. The famous Longitude Prize, is a good example. It was offered way back in 1714 for the first person who could solve the problem of how to tell your longitude at sea. Knowing your longitude is crucial for navigation, it measures how far east or west you are, yet Britain's greatest seafarers and astronomers had failed to crack the problem. The solution came from such an unexpected source - a humble clockmaker called John Harrison - that the authorities refused to grant it for many years. Prince William hopes that similarly left-field ideas will be submitted for these ""Earthshots"". It is why Sir David Attenborough said even seemingly ""crackpot ideas"" are welcome. They know there is good evidence that the wider the pool of ideas, the more effective solutions are offered. Take the online forum InnoCentive. It allows people to post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions. Just as with the Earthshot Prize the aim is to call forth ""insights, flashes of genius and ideas"" from wherever they can. A study found the further the problem in question is from the people who come up with a workable solution, the more likely they are to solve it. Which is another way of saying we all might just hold the key to solving an environmental conundrum. And it explains why Prince William and Sir David Attenborough are saying don't hesitate to apply if you think you've got an idea that could help.

"The temporary closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland could cost thousands of jobs, industry leaders have warned. Licensed premises in five health board areas will close from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October. Elsewhere, they will have reduced opening hours and be barred from selling alcohol indoors. The Scottish government has said the new rules are needed to bring the virus back under control. It has argued that licensed premises are one of the key spreaders of Covid, and is making an additional Â£40m available for affected businesses. Industry leaders have criticised a lack of information about how the funding will be allocated - with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying more detail will be provided on Friday. Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Shoppers warned of return to supermarket queues Ms Sturgeon pointed to the country again having recorded more 1,000 new cases in a day as evidence that the ""hard and painful"" restrictions were needed to protect people's health. And she said the number of coronavirus patients in Scottish hospitals has doubled to 377 over the past week, with 31 being treated in intensive care. A further five people have died after testing positive for the virus. Pubs in some areas will still be able to sell alcohol outside Pubs and restaurants have questioned the scientific evidence behind the decision to shut down them down - and have claimed they were being unfairly singled out. UK Hospitality's executive director for Scotland, Willie Macleod, said many businesses would not survive the new measures - with a ""horrific"" impact on jobs. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Closing bars and restaurants is going to have a massive impact on businesses that are really just climbing back from a prolonged period of lockdown. ""They have reopened with reduced capacity to cope with social distancing, they were then hit by the 10pm curfew, and with reduced demand and reduced consumer confidence. Business resilience is as low as it can be. ""Many businesses won't survive and I'm afraid we're going to see tens of thousands of job losses by the time we do the final count on all of this."" Pubs across the central belt will have to close at 18:00 on Friday Pubs and restaurants will be closed in five health board areas -  Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran  - where about 3.4 million people live. Elsewhere in Scotland, hospitality venues can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food, while alcohol can be served in outside areas until 22:00. Some areas of England are expected have similar rules imposedover the coming days. Stephen Leckie, who runs the Crieff Hydro hotel, said he had 50 cancellations from customers within an hour of the first minister's announcement on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Leckie, who is also chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said the new measures had caused widespread confusion for business owners and customers. He said: ""This industry is in tatters, it's in trouble and now there's turmoil. We have questions to ask, many customers are asking questions and are cancelling in their droves."" Michael McHugh said he is at the end of his tether His views were echoed by Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, who said: ""These measures will sound the death knell for businesses across the hospitality sector, especially pubs and bars. ""Restaurants and hotels, whilst remaining open, will also be constrained on what they can provide and this will place a large dent in their already reduced income."" And pub owner Michael McHugh, who owns Alexander's Bar in Clydebank, said he was ""at the end of my tether"" and finding it increasingly difficult to reassure his staff that their jobs were safe. He added: ""How can you run a business when every other week you're getting shut down?"" Gretna hotelier Alasdair Houston said most of the industry, and its customers, had been behaving responsibly. ""Deal with the rule breakers; don't punish the rule followers by adding yet more and killing the sector,"" he said. ""The industry is being lumped together good with bad, and the primary problem is idiots breaking all the rules."" Crieff Hydro owner Stephen Leckie said there had been a raft of cancellations following the announcement Shops across Scotland will also be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said many shops would be baffled at the request ""in the absence of any evidence which shows shops are a source of infection"". He added: ""These additional restrictions may make it impractical for some to trade at all for this period, and the government must urgently provide details of the proposed support for these viable businesses."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions were needed to prevent the virus spreading to levels similar to the peak of the pandemic by the end of the month. She admitted that the restrictions would be hard on businesses, especially as employers' contributions to the furlough scheme have increased. Shops have been told to reintroduce 2m distancing and one-way systems Her deputy, John Swinney, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government had had to find the extra Â£40 to support the sector. He said: ""It is not extra resources we have had from the UK government, we have had to dig deep into our own resources to find the money to support the hospitality sector through what I accept is going to be a difficult period for them. ""But we are doing that because we must take wider action to protect the public interests in these circumstances."" He said the government has to ""stop the opportunities for interaction where the virus can spread, that appears to be emerging from some aspects of the hospitality sector"". All licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted Cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October Contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports Indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise Outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are being barred from selling alcohol indoors from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October They can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food They will be able to sell alcohol for outside areas until 22:00 Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"This video can not be played Dodging questions and interruptions: While the VP debate was more civil, there were still moments of tension The contenders for US vice-president have clashed over the coronavirus pandemic in their only debate ahead of next month's election. Democrat Kamala Harris called Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration"" in history. Vice-President Mike Pence, a Republican, said the Democratic Party's pandemic plan amounted to ""plagiarism"". Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads Mr Trump with 26 days to go to the vote. Opinion polls indicate the Republican president is trailing by single digits in a handful of battleground states that will decide who wins. Vice-presidents have tie-breaking power in the Senate and are required to step in if a president is unable to perform their duties. Their day-to-day responsibilities vary with each administration, but they typically serve as top advisers and some take on specific policy portfolios. Wednesday night's meeting was a civil debate between two smooth communicators compared to last week's belligerent showdown between Mr Trump and Mr Biden, which degenerated into insults and name-calling. Mr Pence did not interrupt as much as the president last week, but when he did, Ms Harris interjected: ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking, I'm speaking."" The viral moment on Wednesday was a fly landing on Mr Pence's head and remaining there for some two minutes. But there were heated exchanges. Debate reaction and analysis What did we learn from the debate? Fly generates most buzz from VP debate US vice-presidential debate claims fact-checked The 90-minute televised debate at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City was marked by disagreements over the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. Ms Harris accused Mr Pence and the president of deliberately misleading Americans about the lethality of coronavirus. ""They knew, and they covered it up,"" she said, adding that they had ""forfeited their right to re-election"". Mr Pence accused the Biden-Harris campaign of copying the White House's pandemic strategy, alluding to a blunder that ended Mr Biden's 1987 run for the presidency when he plagiarised a speech by then-British Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Ms Harris was asked by the moderator whether she would take an approved Covid-19 vaccine distributed ahead of the election. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The 55-year-old California senator said she would not take a jab touted by Mr Trump without the say-so of medical professionals. Mr Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, retorted: ""The fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration I think is unconscionable."" The plexiglass barriers separating the two debaters seated 12ft (3.6m) apart were a vivid reminder of the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans. The president - who is himself recovering from the virus - returned to the White House on Monday evening after three nights in hospital, with his opinion poll numbers drooping. On Wednesday he declared that catching the disease was a ""blessing from God"" that exposed to him to experimental treatments he vowed would become free for all Americans. Who is Vice-President Mike Pence? Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? In pictures: Harris v Pence debate The virus, meanwhile, has spread through the West Wing of the White House and infected figures inside the president's re-election campaign. ABC News reported that an internal government memo, dated Wednesday, said""34 White House staffers and other contacts"" had been infected in recent days,external. The White House has not yet commented on this. Vice-presidential debates seldom shake up presidential races, and the face-off between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence on Wednesday night seems destined to be no different. Both candidates had strong moments, and a few stumbles, over the course of the 90-minute affair. But as far as lasting memories go, they were few and far between. If this was a match that showcased the futures of the Democratic and Republican parties, the real fireworks will have to wait for the coming years. An unmemorable result, in and of itself, is good news for the Democrats and Joe Biden, who polls suggest are leading in the race. One more campaign set-piece in the books, and one step closer to election day. Read Anthony's key takeaways in full On the question of racial justice, Mr Pence expressed shock at the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. But he added: ""There is no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed."" He pointed to one of his guests in the auditorium, Flora Westbrooks, a black woman whose hair studio was destroyed during unrest in Minneapolis. This video can not be played Harris: 'If you have a pre-existing condition, they're coming for you' He said Mr Biden and Ms Harris's claim that America is systemically racist and that police have an implicit bias against minorities is ""a great insult"". Ms Harris - who was making history by becoming the first black woman to stand on a vice-presidential debate stage - said: ""Last week the president of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists."" A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? ""Not true, not true,"" said Mr Pence, arguing that when Ms Harris was a prosecutor in San Francisco African Americans were more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offences than whites or Latinos. This video can not be played The most talked about guest to take to the stage was also the smallest Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election In other key flashpoints: Ms Harris said the Trump tit-for-tat tariffs on China had caused a manufacturing recession, adding: ""You lost that trade war. You lost it."" Mr Pence hit back: ""Lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden's been a cheerleader for communist China through... the last several decades"" Ms Harris assailed Mr Trump for paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president, according to a New York Times investigation. ""When I first heard about it, I literally said, 'You mean $750,000?' And it was like, 'No, $750'"" Ms Harris said Mr Trump had ""betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world"". Mr Pence said Mr Trump had ordered operations that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani The debate was notable for the questions that the candidates did not directly answer. Mr Pence twice pressed Ms Harris on whether Mr Biden would expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court, which has had nine justices for a century and a half, but she spoke instead aboutMr Trump's current judicial nominee. The Constitution does not say how many justices there must be on the Supreme Court, so if a president and Congress were to agree they could change the law to expand or shrink it. Some Democrats have suggested doing this amid arguments over Mr Trump's nominee, whose confirmation would cement a right-leaning majority on the top court.  Mr Biden has not said whether he would support expanding the court if he became president. Mr Pence - a mild mannered former Indiana governor known for his steadfast loyalty to Mr Trump - did not answer questions about whether he would want his home state of Indiana to ban abortion, or how the Trump administration would ensure medical coverage for sick Americans. This video can not be played Harris and Pence âdodge questionsâ during the vice-presidential debate in Utah Focus on the running mates has intensified given 74-year-old Mr Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis, and the fact that Mr Biden would be the oldest president ever to take office at 78. But when asked by the debate moderator about the chances of them taking over the presidency, both candidates skirted the subject. Mr Pence, 61, assailed Mr Biden's handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, and Ms Harris - the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father - spoke of her own biography. Shloka Ananthanarayanan (Democrat):""I wouldn't necessarily say there was one moment that stood out, but what stood out was the tone and the fact that no one was yelling at each other during this debate."" Jim Sullivan (Republican):""Given the age of the two candidates, the vice-presidential pick this time around is pretty significant. Last week was just distressing, so this was a real breath of fresh air. I don't agree with Kamala Harris on a lot of things, but they both handled themselves well and I liked the format."" Akayla Sellers (Democrat):""They could have discussed a lot more in depth about healthcare, education and the racial uproar. You see a lot of people crowding the streets, they are the younger generation and they didn't discuss that in depth."" Gordon Kou (Republican):""They did a better job of defending their candidates than the actual candidates did. Overall, the winner was America because we somewhat saved face after the debacle last week.""

"However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the Coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Pubs and restaurants in central Scotland to close Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Would that happen everywhere? Or just in the most affected parts of the country? Would closures be total or for a certain period of time only? Would they be temporary? Or put in place until an indeterminate time? A lot is unknown, but the discussions are serious. The Treasury is already looking at financial support for the different options, including not just closing pubs in the most affected areas, but potentially well beyond. There is a lot yet to settle, and the next formal announcement is likely (as things stand) not to come until Monday. But more action is clearly on the way.

"The first debate descended into insults and interruptions US President Donald Trump has refused to take part in a virtual TV debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The commission organising the debate in Miami on 15 October said it would have to take place remotely after Mr Trump tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Trump's refusal sparked a day of wrangling about how and when any further debates would take place. At the moment it appears a debate could take place on 22 October, although in what form remains to be seen. The first presidential debate on 29 September had descended into insults and interruptions. The vice-presidential debate, held on Wednesday night between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, was a far more measured affair. The US election will be held on 3 November. Latest opinion polls suggest Mr Biden has a high single digit lead nationally, but the outcome is often decided in battleground states where the races can be much closer. US election 2020: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What did we learn from the VP debate? Six million votes have already been cast in early voting. It began with the Commission on Presidential Debates announcing candidates would take part in the Miami debate ""from separate remote locations... to protect the health and safety of all involved"". This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins This infuriated the president who, in a phone-in interview with Fox Business Channel, said he was ""not gonna waste my time"" on a virtual debate and ""sit behind a computer, ridiculous"". Joe Biden said the president ""changed his mind every second"" and his campaign team added that Mr Trump ""clearly does not want to face questions from the voters"". The Trump campaign answered back, with manager Bill Stepien calling the commission's decision to ""rush to Joe Biden's defence... pathetic"" and saying Mr Trump would hold a rally instead on 15 October. The Biden team then proposed the town-hall style debate, set for Miami, should go ahead on 22 October instead. This brought a brief moment of agreement, on the date at least. Joe Biden: ""You never know what's going to come out of his mouth"" However, the Trump team said there should be a third face-to-face debate - on 29 October, just five days before polling. No, said the Biden team. Three dates had been set for debates - 29 September, 15 October and 22 October. That would be it. On 15 October, Mr Biden will now take part in his own primetime event on ABC answering questions from voters. Quite what format any Biden-Trump debate takes now is hard to pin down. He touched on a number of key matters, including his health and the possibility of movement towards a stimulus package for the economy. On his health, Mr Trump said: ""I'm back because I'm a perfect physical specimen."" Who has Trump met and who's tested positive? He said he had stopped taking most ""therapeutics"" but was still taking steroids and would be tested for Covid again ""soon"".

And although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"".

A gathering on 26 September announcing Mr Trump's Supreme Court pick has been seen as a possible ""super-spreader"" event, with several attendees known to have tested positive. The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak The president on Tuesday had said he was breaking off talks with the Democrats on an overarching Covid stimulus package but, after a negative stock market reaction, said he would instead try to agree individual deals. He was more bullish on Thursday, saying he saw ""really good"" odds of reaching a deal on a range of issues. ""We're starting to have some very productive talks,"" he said. The main areas of progress were on assistance for airlines and a $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheque for workers.

"Caroline Langton opted to move to Ramsgate rather than east London Caroline Langton was on the cusp of exchanging on a flat in East London earlier this year - and then came the coronavirus lockdown. Instead, she ended up buying a property in Ramsgate near the sea. She's not alone - property website Rightmove says homebuyers are looking to escape crowded cities and big towns by moving to the country or the coast. Coronavirus has meant more people are working from home while lockdown made them realise they wanted more space. Rightmove said that searches have doubled for homes in small towns and villages with populations less than 11,000. For Ms Langton, the pandemic ""changed everything"". She was renting a property in Margate as she and a friend were just about to exchange on a flat in Leyton, East London when the lockdown began in March. It made her think again about moving to the capital. ""In Margate you've got that huge panoramic beach, and you get that sense of space, which you just don't get in London,"" she says. ""Living with a friend in a small property wasn't the best idea,"" she adds, especially as both potential flatmates have partners. Instead, Ms Langton decided to buy a property in Ramsgate. The economics added up. To get a small two-bedroom flat in Leyton would have cost twice as much as a bigger place in Ramsgate. Buying next to the sea also worked for her job as co-founder of an interior planting design company which can deal with clients remotely. According to Rightmove, seaside resorts have seen the biggest rise in sales, as people sought more space during lockdown. ""The desire to move to the country has turned into a trend from a short-term shift,"" said Rightmove's Tim Bannister. ""Back in May when the market reopened in England we wondered how long the desire to move to the country or to smaller towns and villages would last."" House prices at all-time high, says Nationwide Mini house-buying boom leads to highest ever monthly price He said there are two main reasons for the trend: some buyers are more willing to have a country commute a few times a week, while others are preparing for social distancing to be here for some time and so are being drawn to places with more outdoor space. But anyone buying now should expect prices to be lower next year, estate agents have warned. The latest RICS UK Residential Survey has revealed expectations that prices will move into negative territory over the next 12 months. ""There is increasing concern that the combination of significant job losses over the coming months allied to the scaling back of policy initiatives in early 2021 will have an adverse impact on transaction levels,"" warned Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Fancy moving to a coastal cottage? However, despite warning of negative prices next year, RICS reported strong house sales in September. Halifax reported earlier in the week that house prices jumped by 7.3% in September - the strongest annual increase since June 2016. It took the average UK house price to just below quarter of a million pounds, at Â£249,870, Halifax said. These reports encapsulate the difference between vision and reality for many potential homebuyers. The pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic priorities, with space inside and out becoming more attractive for some than the buzz of a town or city. But actually making that move may not be so easy. Demand may not be matched by countryside properties coming on the market - whether it be a two-bedroom terrace or a detached property in its own grounds. Then there is the question of how easy it is to sell an existing urban home, particularly during dark autumn and winter months. On top of that, lenders are restricting mortgages for those without lots of equity, to reduce their own exposure to an economic downturn. And, as always, jobs and pay are key in giving people the confidence and financial security to move - and with heavy redundancies on the cards, that may slow activity in the housing sector. According to Rightmove, searches for properties in nine areas in England have doubled, and all have populations under 11,000. Searches for homes in Lightwater in Surrey have risen the most - up 130% in the past year. The village has a population of less than 7,000 people, and house prices range from a studio flat on offer for Â£155,000 to a five-bed house with an asking price of more than Â£3.6m. Other small villages and market towns have proved popular with searches up 128% for Bruton in Somerset and up 111% for Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. The other locations where searches have doubled are: Hungerford, Berkshire Sturminster Newton, Dorset Aylesford, Kent Shaftesbury, Dorset Halesworth, Suffolk and Dartmouth, Devon. The latter harbour town also tops the table for the biggest increase in the number of sales agreed, up by 179% in the past year. St Ives in Cornwall posted a 170% rise in sales with Buckhurst Hill, Essex up 164% and Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire up 156%.

"A UK bullock arriving in the port of Cartagena, which campaigners said was later loaded onto a vessel destined for Libya Livestock from the UK is being shipped to the Middle East and slaughtered in ""dreadful, terrifying"" ways, animal welfare charities claim. Over the summer, the charities tracked cattle on long journeys via Spanish fattening farms and ports. In footage, shared with the BBC, a dead bullock at an abattoir in Lebanon in August is seen to have a UK ear-tag. The Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was committed to improving animal welfare. UK livestock is protected by EU laws during transport. Britain does not export animals to third countries for slaughter or fattening where welfare standards are lower. But undercover filming by Animals International and the German Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF) provided video evidence suggesting British livestock is being re-sold in Europe to the Middle East. One UK bullock, believed to be from Northern Ireland, is recorded at the port of Cartagena in Spain in July before being loaded onto a vessel destined for Libya. ""In 30 years of working, nothing compares with the horrors of a slaughter house in North Africa or the Middle East"", said Peter Stevenson from Compassion in World Farming. ""Footage from the facility in Lebanon shows the same, awful methods we have seen before,"" he said. ""Animals are hacked at repeatedly until they die. Often they are winched up by a leg or their tendons are slashed to disable them."" Animals International said it was ""appalling"" to find British cattle being killed in Lebanon by ""poorly equipped, untrained workers, while fully conscious and terrified"". The charity found livestock carriers took around a week to sail from Cartagena to Libya or Lebanon. Alandmark veterinary report,externalinto the transport of livestock in 2016 concluded that animals suffered every day at sea in filthy, cramped conditions. A UK calf which charity investigators said was dying and had been moved outside of its pen at a fattening farm in Catalonia in June Calves in particular were found to die frequently of disease, thirst or heat-related illnesses. The former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: ""It is stomach-churning to think of cattle from the UK being subjected to such horrific treatment. ""This footage should be a wake-up call,"" she said. ""Now we have left the EU, the government needs to ban live exports for slaughter or fattening."" The UK currently exports some livestock to third countries for breeding. EU rules, which apply in the UK until at least January, limit the number of hours animals can travel without being rested and also the density of stock. They also require various vet checks at borders. Unweaned male calves are by-products of the dairy industry. The UK exported around 17,000 last year to Spain, the majority from Northern Ireland. However, consignments have fallen this year and in SeptemberScotland agreed to stop shipping calves through the port of Ramsgate in Kent,external. Having reached Spain calves are typically fattened on farms before being slaughtered or re-exported. At a facility in Catalonia in June, charity workers say they filmed a UK calf that had been moved outside of its pen and left to die. Maria Boada, an AWF vet, who gathered the footage, said: ""The calf was suffering from a respiratory illness, which is common after long, stressful journeys with little food or milk replacement. ""For many farmers, sick calves are seen as disposable due to their low value and ready availability."" Recent Lords amendments to the Agriculture Bill to ban live exports have been defeated. A Defra spokesman said: ""Now that we have left the EU, we will be taking forward the manifesto commitment to end excessively long journeys for animals going to slaughter and fattening."" The National Farmers Union said the standards seen in the abattoir were ""appalling"" and fell far below what is required of British farmers. A spokesperson said it had developed its own proposals for a live export assurance scheme. ""We will be looking to work with the government to implement it so that we can maintain this important trade under the highest standards of animal welfare,"" he said.

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge. He said the experimental antibody cocktail he was given last week was a cure rather than a therapeutic measure, adding that hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready.  But Regeneron's drugs have not been approved by federal regulators. ""This was a blessing in disguise - I caught it, I heard about this drug, I said let me take it and it was incredible,"" he said, adding that he would seek emergency use authorisations for the drugs. President Trump renewed his attacks on China, telling Americans: ""You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault. And China is going to pay a big price. This was China's fault."" Earlier, Dr Conley said the president had not needed any supplemental oxygen since going to hospital on Friday. He was discharged on Monday. All the medication Trump is taking, explained Trump's healthcare v the average American's The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? Mr Trump's supporters say that he has shown leadership since his release from hospital. But his opponents say his behaviour has become increasingly erratic. The White House has also set out new safety measures after President Trump's return from hospital and the news that another aide had Covid-19. The presidential election is on 3 November. One key issue in the run-up to polling day is a coronavirus stimulus package for the economy. Mr Trump appeared to abandon negotiations with the Democrats on Tuesday, only to say later he would agree to some measures individually. ""His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range,""  a health report from Dr Conley said. This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House It added: ""The president's labs demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies on Monday October 5th."" Levels drawn last Thursday had shown ""undetectable"" antibodies. ""We'll continue to closely monitor and I will update you as I know more,"" the doctor said. The body makes antibodies to help fight the infection, and coronavirus antibodies in the blood indicate a person has had the virus. However, it remains unknown whether their presence will prevent the person getting the virus again. Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon to be briefed on Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico and the latest on talks with Democrats about a stimulus package for the economy, officials said. Mr Trump has been in a defiant mood since returning from hospital, angling to work in the Oval Office rather than in the Residence, as well as pushing for an address to the nation and a resumption of campaign activity. But many of his aides and staff remain in self-isolation. Earlier in the day, chief of staff Mark Meadows said that anyone interacting with Mr Trump had been wearing ""full PPE, masks, goggles and the like"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune"": Trump's controversial return to the White House A memo on Monday called for limited traffic on the first floor of the West Wing and at the Residence, with strict measures on protection equipment and hand sanitiser for anyone within six feet (two metres) of the president. Reports said there did appear to be much more mask-wearing at the White House, which had been criticised by many opponents for its lax attitude before Mr Trump's infection. Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. At least nine White House employees have tested positive but the cluster could be much higher. White House communications head Alyssa Farah with a mask. It does appear there are now stricter measures Some staff have expressed concern to US media that they were exposed without their knowledge to people who were known to be infected or were at risk of being Covid-positive. Leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the White House was ""one of the most dangerous places in the country"", adding she would ""not go anywhere near it"". Stephen Miller was the latest aide to test positive - on Tuesday. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and at least three other press staff have also been infected. Several senior military leaders are also quarantining after Coast Guard official Admiral Charles Ray tested positive. Opinion polls over the past week have suggested Mr Biden had a lead of between eight and 12 percentage points over Mr Trump nationwide, but it is likely the election will be decided in battleground states where the race is often closer. On Tuesday, Mr Trump saidhe was ending negotiations with the Democratsover a Covid-19 relief bill and would only resume talks after the election. After a negative stock market reaction, Mr Trump said he would support some stand-alone bills, later tweeting: ""Move fast, I am waiting to sign!"" a bill for $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheques to the American people. Mr Meadows said there were about ""10 things that we can do on a piecemeal basis"". Ms Pelosi said Mr Trump was ""rebounding from a terrible mistake"". She reportedly was in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday on the possibility of a bill to aid US airlines. Why won't White House say when Trump had last test?

"This video can not be played Dodging questions and interruptions: While the VP debate was more civil, there were still moments of tension The contenders for US vice-president have clashed over the coronavirus pandemic in their only debate ahead of next month's election. Democrat Kamala Harris called Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration"" in history. Vice-President Mike Pence, a Republican, said the Democratic Party's pandemic plan amounted to ""plagiarism"". Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads Mr Trump with 26 days to go to the vote. Opinion polls indicate the Republican president is trailing by single digits in a handful of battleground states that will decide who wins. Vice-presidents have tie-breaking power in the Senate and are required to step in if a president is unable to perform their duties. Their day-to-day responsibilities vary with each administration, but they typically serve as top advisers and some take on specific policy portfolios. Wednesday night's meeting was a civil debate between two smooth communicators compared to last week's belligerent showdown between Mr Trump and Mr Biden, which degenerated into insults and name-calling. Mr Pence did not interrupt as much as the president last week, but when he did, Ms Harris interjected: ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking, I'm speaking."" The viral moment on Wednesday was a fly landing on Mr Pence's head and remaining there for some two minutes. But there were heated exchanges. Debate reaction and analysis What did we learn from the debate? Fly generates most buzz from VP debate US vice-presidential debate claims fact-checked The 90-minute televised debate at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City was marked by disagreements over the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. Ms Harris accused Mr Pence and the president of deliberately misleading Americans about the lethality of coronavirus. ""They knew, and they covered it up,"" she said, adding that they had ""forfeited their right to re-election"". Mr Pence accused the Biden-Harris campaign of copying the White House's pandemic strategy, alluding to a blunder that ended Mr Biden's 1987 run for the presidency when he plagiarised a speech by then-British Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Ms Harris was asked by the moderator whether she would take an approved Covid-19 vaccine distributed ahead of the election. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The 55-year-old California senator said she would not take a jab touted by Mr Trump without the say-so of medical professionals. Mr Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, retorted: ""The fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration I think is unconscionable."" The plexiglass barriers separating the two debaters seated 12ft (3.6m) apart were a vivid reminder of the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans. The president - who is himself recovering from the virus - returned to the White House on Monday evening after three nights in hospital, with his opinion poll numbers drooping. On Wednesday he declared that catching the disease was a ""blessing from God"" that exposed to him to experimental treatments he vowed would become free for all Americans. Who is Vice-President Mike Pence? Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? In pictures: Harris v Pence debate The virus, meanwhile, has spread through the West Wing of the White House and infected figures inside the president's re-election campaign. ABC News reported that an internal government memo, dated Wednesday, said""34 White House staffers and other contacts"" had been infected in recent days,external. The White House has not yet commented on this. Vice-presidential debates seldom shake up presidential races, and the face-off between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence on Wednesday night seems destined to be no different. Both candidates had strong moments, and a few stumbles, over the course of the 90-minute affair. But as far as lasting memories go, they were few and far between. If this was a match that showcased the futures of the Democratic and Republican parties, the real fireworks will have to wait for the coming years. An unmemorable result, in and of itself, is good news for the Democrats and Joe Biden, who polls suggest are leading in the race. One more campaign set-piece in the books, and one step closer to election day. Read Anthony's key takeaways in full On the question of racial justice, Mr Pence expressed shock at the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. But he added: ""There is no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed."" He pointed to one of his guests in the auditorium, Flora Westbrooks, a black woman whose hair studio was destroyed during unrest in Minneapolis. This video can not be played Harris: 'If you have a pre-existing condition, they're coming for you' He said Mr Biden and Ms Harris's claim that America is systemically racist and that police have an implicit bias against minorities is ""a great insult"". Ms Harris - who was making history by becoming the first black woman to stand on a vice-presidential debate stage - said: ""Last week the president of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists."" A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? ""Not true, not true,"" said Mr Pence, arguing that when Ms Harris was a prosecutor in San Francisco African Americans were more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offences than whites or Latinos. This video can not be played The most talked about guest to take to the stage was also the smallest Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election In other key flashpoints: Ms Harris said the Trump tit-for-tat tariffs on China had caused a manufacturing recession, adding: ""You lost that trade war. You lost it."" Mr Pence hit back: ""Lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden's been a cheerleader for communist China through... the last several decades"" Ms Harris assailed Mr Trump for paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president, according to a New York Times investigation. ""When I first heard about it, I literally said, 'You mean $750,000?' And it was like, 'No, $750'"" Ms Harris said Mr Trump had ""betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world"". Mr Pence said Mr Trump had ordered operations that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani The debate was notable for the questions that the candidates did not directly answer. Mr Pence twice pressed Ms Harris on whether Mr Biden would expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court, which has had nine justices for a century and a half, but she spoke instead aboutMr Trump's current judicial nominee. The Constitution does not say how many justices there must be on the Supreme Court, so if a president and Congress were to agree they could change the law to expand or shrink it. Some Democrats have suggested doing this amid arguments over Mr Trump's nominee, whose confirmation would cement a right-leaning majority on the top court.  Mr Biden has not said whether he would support expanding the court if he became president. Mr Pence - a mild mannered former Indiana governor known for his steadfast loyalty to Mr Trump - did not answer questions about whether he would want his home state of Indiana to ban abortion, or how the Trump administration would ensure medical coverage for sick Americans. This video can not be played Harris and Pence âdodge questionsâ during the vice-presidential debate in Utah Focus on the running mates has intensified given 74-year-old Mr Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis, and the fact that Mr Biden would be the oldest president ever to take office at 78. But when asked by the debate moderator about the chances of them taking over the presidency, both candidates skirted the subject. Mr Pence, 61, assailed Mr Biden's handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, and Ms Harris - the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father - spoke of her own biography. Shloka Ananthanarayanan (Democrat):""I wouldn't necessarily say there was one moment that stood out, but what stood out was the tone and the fact that no one was yelling at each other during this debate."" Jim Sullivan (Republican):""Given the age of the two candidates, the vice-presidential pick this time around is pretty significant. Last week was just distressing, so this was a real breath of fresh air. I don't agree with Kamala Harris on a lot of things, but they both handled themselves well and I liked the format."" Akayla Sellers (Democrat):""They could have discussed a lot more in depth about healthcare, education and the racial uproar. You see a lot of people crowding the streets, they are the younger generation and they didn't discuss that in depth."" Gordon Kou (Republican):""They did a better job of defending their candidates than the actual candidates did. Overall, the winner was America because we somewhat saved face after the debacle last week.""

"The use of mandatory face coverings in Northern Ireland is also to be extended People in Northern Ireland caught breaching coronavirus regulations will now face a minimum fine of Â£200 under plans agreed by the executive. Thursday's meeting saw ministers sign off on proposals brought by Justice Minister Naomi Long. At present, fixed penalty notices start at Â£60, but can rise to Â£960 for repeat offenders. First Minister Arlene Foster also confirmed that the use of mandatory face coverings in NI is to be extended. Face coverings are alreadycompulsory on public transportand forcustomers in shops, but will now become mandatory in the following settings: Taxis and private buses For staff in retail shops In public areas of civil services offices such as jobs and benefits offices When boarding a plane In banks, building societies, credit unions and post offices For driving instructors and their students The usual exemptions from wearing a face covering will still apply, the executive has said. Mrs Foster told a press briefing at Stormont that there would be a ""new regime"" of penalties to strengthen existing measures to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. ""The consequences from today will be more serious,"" she said. ""I'm saying to everyone - how far and how hard the executive will have to go depends on your actions today, tomorrow, over the weekend and the week ahead."" The executive has also agreed to introduce three new offences: not closing a business as required, breaching closing times and not implementing social distancing. Breaches will incur a fixed penalty notice of Â£1,000, or up to Â£10,000 on conviction. The justice minister told BBC News NI's The View that ""encouragement, engagement and explanation can work"". ""But we're also clear that enforcement matters,"" said Naomi Long. ""There will be those who defy the law, who refuse to take it seriously and enforcement has to follow. ""But that enforcement is going to be the last of the four options we have available to us."" A further 923 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. In the last seven days, 4,674 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive. The department also confirmed the death of another person who died following a positive test, bringing its death toll to 587. There are 120 people with Covid-19 in hospital - 15 are in intensive care. Despite speculation, the executive has agreed not to impose new local restrictions in the Newry, Mourne and Down or Belfast council areas, where cases have been rising sharply in recent days. Mrs Foster said the executive had been advised that ""the growth of infections has been blunted"" in those areas, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive was keeping that decision ""under review"". The Department of Health used this slide at their briefing on Wednesday to show case rates across Northern Ireland She added that the executive is ""united"" in its decision to ask for additional financial support from the British government to take further action to tackle the virus. ""It is clear the executive is fast approaching a point on making significant difficult decisions that will help us arrest the rise in infections,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said ministers would not take any decisions lightly, and that they would try to maintain the ""balanced approach"" regarding saving people's lives and their livelihoods. She and Mrs Foster have asked for ""an urgent conversation"" with Mr Johnson due to cases rising ""at an alarming rate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin and Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed concerns about the situation in Northern Ireland. The two leaders spoke by phone on Thursday morning. Mr Martin said that he told Mr Johnson that the situation in Northern Ireland was ""very, very worrying in terms of the growing numbers"" of positive cases. The taoiseach added that the Northern Ireland Executive ""needed support"" and he asked Mr Johnson to ""give consideration in terms of financial support to underpin any efforts or any restrictions that they themselves might decide to bring in"". According to an Irish government spokesperson, Mr Johnson also raised concerns about the impact of ""restrictions on the economy"". The two leaders agreed to monitor the situation and remain in touch. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland Chief Scientific AdviserProf Ian Young said of the coronavirus clusters identified, more than half of them had been linked to the hospitality sector. Stormont ministers have not ruled out bringing in a circuit breaker over the half-term holidays, if localised restrictions do not help to halt the rise in infections. A circuit breaker is a lockdown for a short period of time, possibly two weeks, to slow the spread of the virus. It would likely see all pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland forced to close for the two weeks. But Economy Minister Diane Dodds said it would only be viable with additional financial support from Westminster. Drinks only bars only reopened on 23 September after nearly six months of closure It is thought there could be further announcements next week from the Treasury about providing support to the hospitality industry inthe worst hit areas of England, where pub closures are being explored. That could automatically lead to some extra funding for Northern Ireland through what is known as a Barnett consequential. Meanwhile, figures obtained by BBC News NI show there are almost 1,200 health care staff off work as a result of coronavirus in Northern Ireland - either self-isolating or directly affected by the virus. The highest figure was recorded in the Western Trust area, which runs Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, where 386 staff are isolating. In Belfast, the figure is at least 384, while there is a further 193 staff affected at the Southern Trust, 117 in the South Eastern Trust and 116 at the Northern Trust. At the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS), 68 people are off work. The interim chief executive of the South Eastern Health Trust, Seamus McGoran, said now is ""a critical time"" for the NHS and the public. ""It feels rather like March, when we were not really in the foothills of the surge, but one third to half way up the mountain,"" he said. ""Unless we make dramatic changes to our behaviours within the community, we're going to be exactly where we were in about two to three weeks' time.""

"The temporary closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland could cost thousands of jobs, industry leaders have warned. Licensed premises in five health board areas will close from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October. Elsewhere, they will have reduced opening hours and be barred from selling alcohol indoors. The Scottish government has said the new rules are needed to bring the virus back under control. It has argued that licensed premises are one of the key spreaders of Covid, and is making an additional Â£40m available for affected businesses. Industry leaders have criticised a lack of information about how the funding will be allocated - with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying more detail will be provided on Friday. Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Shoppers warned of return to supermarket queues Ms Sturgeon pointed to the country again having recorded more 1,000 new cases in a day as evidence that the ""hard and painful"" restrictions were needed to protect people's health. And she said the number of coronavirus patients in Scottish hospitals has doubled to 377 over the past week, with 31 being treated in intensive care. A further five people have died after testing positive for the virus. Pubs in some areas will still be able to sell alcohol outside Pubs and restaurants have questioned the scientific evidence behind the decision to shut down them down - and have claimed they were being unfairly singled out. UK Hospitality's executive director for Scotland, Willie Macleod, said many businesses would not survive the new measures - with a ""horrific"" impact on jobs. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Closing bars and restaurants is going to have a massive impact on businesses that are really just climbing back from a prolonged period of lockdown. ""They have reopened with reduced capacity to cope with social distancing, they were then hit by the 10pm curfew, and with reduced demand and reduced consumer confidence. Business resilience is as low as it can be. ""Many businesses won't survive and I'm afraid we're going to see tens of thousands of job losses by the time we do the final count on all of this."" Pubs across the central belt will have to close at 18:00 on Friday Pubs and restaurants will be closed in five health board areas -  Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran  - where about 3.4 million people live. Elsewhere in Scotland, hospitality venues can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food, while alcohol can be served in outside areas until 22:00. Some areas of England are expected have similar rules imposedover the coming days. Stephen Leckie, who runs the Crieff Hydro hotel, said he had 50 cancellations from customers within an hour of the first minister's announcement on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Leckie, who is also chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said the new measures had caused widespread confusion for business owners and customers. He said: ""This industry is in tatters, it's in trouble and now there's turmoil. We have questions to ask, many customers are asking questions and are cancelling in their droves."" Michael McHugh said he is at the end of his tether His views were echoed by Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, who said: ""These measures will sound the death knell for businesses across the hospitality sector, especially pubs and bars. ""Restaurants and hotels, whilst remaining open, will also be constrained on what they can provide and this will place a large dent in their already reduced income."" And pub owner Michael McHugh, who owns Alexander's Bar in Clydebank, said he was ""at the end of my tether"" and finding it increasingly difficult to reassure his staff that their jobs were safe. He added: ""How can you run a business when every other week you're getting shut down?"" Gretna hotelier Alasdair Houston said most of the industry, and its customers, had been behaving responsibly. ""Deal with the rule breakers; don't punish the rule followers by adding yet more and killing the sector,"" he said. ""The industry is being lumped together good with bad, and the primary problem is idiots breaking all the rules."" Crieff Hydro owner Stephen Leckie said there had been a raft of cancellations following the announcement Shops across Scotland will also be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said many shops would be baffled at the request ""in the absence of any evidence which shows shops are a source of infection"". He added: ""These additional restrictions may make it impractical for some to trade at all for this period, and the government must urgently provide details of the proposed support for these viable businesses."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions were needed to prevent the virus spreading to levels similar to the peak of the pandemic by the end of the month. She admitted that the restrictions would be hard on businesses, especially as employers' contributions to the furlough scheme have increased. Shops have been told to reintroduce 2m distancing and one-way systems Her deputy, John Swinney, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government had had to find the extra Â£40 to support the sector. He said: ""It is not extra resources we have had from the UK government, we have had to dig deep into our own resources to find the money to support the hospitality sector through what I accept is going to be a difficult period for them. ""But we are doing that because we must take wider action to protect the public interests in these circumstances."" He said the government has to ""stop the opportunities for interaction where the virus can spread, that appears to be emerging from some aspects of the hospitality sector"". All licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted Cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October Contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports Indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise Outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are being barred from selling alcohol indoors from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October They can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food They will be able to sell alcohol for outside areas until 22:00 Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge. He said the experimental antibody cocktail he was given last week was a cure rather than a therapeutic measure, adding that hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready.  But Regeneron's drugs have not been approved by federal regulators. ""This was a blessing in disguise - I caught it, I heard about this drug, I said let me take it and it was incredible,"" he said, adding that he would seek emergency use authorisations for the drugs. President Trump renewed his attacks on China, telling Americans: ""You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault. And China is going to pay a big price. This was China's fault."" Earlier, Dr Conley said the president had not needed any supplemental oxygen since going to hospital on Friday. He was discharged on Monday. All the medication Trump is taking, explained Trump's healthcare v the average American's The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? Mr Trump's supporters say that he has shown leadership since his release from hospital. But his opponents say his behaviour has become increasingly erratic. The White House has also set out new safety measures after President Trump's return from hospital and the news that another aide had Covid-19. The presidential election is on 3 November. One key issue in the run-up to polling day is a coronavirus stimulus package for the economy. Mr Trump appeared to abandon negotiations with the Democrats on Tuesday, only to say later he would agree to some measures individually. ""His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range,""  a health report from Dr Conley said. This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House It added: ""The president's labs demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies on Monday October 5th."" Levels drawn last Thursday had shown ""undetectable"" antibodies. ""We'll continue to closely monitor and I will update you as I know more,"" the doctor said. The body makes antibodies to help fight the infection, and coronavirus antibodies in the blood indicate a person has had the virus. However, it remains unknown whether their presence will prevent the person getting the virus again. Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon to be briefed on Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico and the latest on talks with Democrats about a stimulus package for the economy, officials said. Mr Trump has been in a defiant mood since returning from hospital, angling to work in the Oval Office rather than in the Residence, as well as pushing for an address to the nation and a resumption of campaign activity. But many of his aides and staff remain in self-isolation. Earlier in the day, chief of staff Mark Meadows said that anyone interacting with Mr Trump had been wearing ""full PPE, masks, goggles and the like"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune"": Trump's controversial return to the White House A memo on Monday called for limited traffic on the first floor of the West Wing and at the Residence, with strict measures on protection equipment and hand sanitiser for anyone within six feet (two metres) of the president. Reports said there did appear to be much more mask-wearing at the White House, which had been criticised by many opponents for its lax attitude before Mr Trump's infection. Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. At least nine White House employees have tested positive but the cluster could be much higher. White House communications head Alyssa Farah with a mask. It does appear there are now stricter measures Some staff have expressed concern to US media that they were exposed without their knowledge to people who were known to be infected or were at risk of being Covid-positive. Leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the White House was ""one of the most dangerous places in the country"", adding she would ""not go anywhere near it"". Stephen Miller was the latest aide to test positive - on Tuesday. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and at least three other press staff have also been infected. Several senior military leaders are also quarantining after Coast Guard official Admiral Charles Ray tested positive. Opinion polls over the past week have suggested Mr Biden had a lead of between eight and 12 percentage points over Mr Trump nationwide, but it is likely the election will be decided in battleground states where the race is often closer. On Tuesday, Mr Trump saidhe was ending negotiations with the Democratsover a Covid-19 relief bill and would only resume talks after the election. After a negative stock market reaction, Mr Trump said he would support some stand-alone bills, later tweeting: ""Move fast, I am waiting to sign!"" a bill for $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheques to the American people. Mr Meadows said there were about ""10 things that we can do on a piecemeal basis"". Ms Pelosi said Mr Trump was ""rebounding from a terrible mistake"". She reportedly was in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday on the possibility of a bill to aid US airlines. Why won't White House say when Trump had last test?

"A UK bullock arriving in the port of Cartagena, which campaigners said was later loaded onto a vessel destined for Libya Livestock from the UK is being shipped to the Middle East and slaughtered in ""dreadful, terrifying"" ways, animal welfare charities claim. Over the summer, the charities tracked cattle on long journeys via Spanish fattening farms and ports. In footage, shared with the BBC, a dead bullock at an abattoir in Lebanon in August is seen to have a UK ear-tag. The Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was committed to improving animal welfare. UK livestock is protected by EU laws during transport. Britain does not export animals to third countries for slaughter or fattening where welfare standards are lower. But undercover filming by Animals International and the German Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF) provided video evidence suggesting British livestock is being re-sold in Europe to the Middle East. One UK bullock, believed to be from Northern Ireland, is recorded at the port of Cartagena in Spain in July before being loaded onto a vessel destined for Libya. ""In 30 years of working, nothing compares with the horrors of a slaughter house in North Africa or the Middle East"", said Peter Stevenson from Compassion in World Farming. ""Footage from the facility in Lebanon shows the same, awful methods we have seen before,"" he said. ""Animals are hacked at repeatedly until they die. Often they are winched up by a leg or their tendons are slashed to disable them."" Animals International said it was ""appalling"" to find British cattle being killed in Lebanon by ""poorly equipped, untrained workers, while fully conscious and terrified"". The charity found livestock carriers took around a week to sail from Cartagena to Libya or Lebanon. Alandmark veterinary report,externalinto the transport of livestock in 2016 concluded that animals suffered every day at sea in filthy, cramped conditions. A UK calf which charity investigators said was dying and had been moved outside of its pen at a fattening farm in Catalonia in June Calves in particular were found to die frequently of disease, thirst or heat-related illnesses. The former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: ""It is stomach-churning to think of cattle from the UK being subjected to such horrific treatment. ""This footage should be a wake-up call,"" she said. ""Now we have left the EU, the government needs to ban live exports for slaughter or fattening."" The UK currently exports some livestock to third countries for breeding. EU rules, which apply in the UK until at least January, limit the number of hours animals can travel without being rested and also the density of stock. They also require various vet checks at borders. Unweaned male calves are by-products of the dairy industry. The UK exported around 17,000 last year to Spain, the majority from Northern Ireland. However, consignments have fallen this year and in SeptemberScotland agreed to stop shipping calves through the port of Ramsgate in Kent,external. Having reached Spain calves are typically fattened on farms before being slaughtered or re-exported. At a facility in Catalonia in June, charity workers say they filmed a UK calf that had been moved outside of its pen and left to die. Maria Boada, an AWF vet, who gathered the footage, said: ""The calf was suffering from a respiratory illness, which is common after long, stressful journeys with little food or milk replacement. ""For many farmers, sick calves are seen as disposable due to their low value and ready availability."" Recent Lords amendments to the Agriculture Bill to ban live exports have been defeated. A Defra spokesman said: ""Now that we have left the EU, we will be taking forward the manifesto commitment to end excessively long journeys for animals going to slaughter and fattening."" The National Farmers Union said the standards seen in the abattoir were ""appalling"" and fell far below what is required of British farmers. A spokesperson said it had developed its own proposals for a live export assurance scheme. ""We will be looking to work with the government to implement it so that we can maintain this important trade under the highest standards of animal welfare,"" he said.

"Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence debated in Salt Lake City, Utah It was more civil than last week's chaotic event at the top of the ticket and had more policy discussions Pence defended the US response to Covid-19, which has killed 200,000 Americans Harris called it ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country"" They also tangled over taxes, with Pence accusing Harris of a tax hike on working people, which she denies The duo on stage were separated by glass barriers as a precaution for the pandemic A fly landing on Pence's head during the debate provided a little light relief for thousands on social media Edited by Helier Cheung Thanks for following our live reporting on the US election vice-presidential debate - we're bringing it to a close now. Here's a recap of what we saw and heard on Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah:  For more, you canread our reporter Anthony Zurcher's five takeaways from the debate. We'll be back next week with live coverage of the second presidential debate, and in the meantime you can also follow ourlive coronavirus coverage here.

The editors were Vicky Baker, Matthew Davis and Helier Cheung.   Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years. Read more:Five takeaways from the VP debate Amid all the coverage of the debate, you might have missed this news from Facebook. The social media platform has announced a new series of measures regarding the US election. Noting that final election results may take longer to come in than usual due to the pandemic and postal voting, the social media giant said on Wednesday it was trying to ""prevent the spread of misinformation"". New measures include: - Notifications on posts saying the count is ongoing, if a ""candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". - Banning content that ""seeks to intimidate voters"", including ""calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarised language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate"". - Not running political or social issues adverts after the polls close on Election Day Facebook recently banned adverts seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"".

Plexiglass screens were erected around the candidates' desks as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus The debate saw sharp but civil exchanges between the candidates on topics including coronavirus, the climate, healthcare and taxes Senator Kamala Harris reminded Mike Pence several times not to interrupt her while she was speaking A fly took residence on Mike Pence's head for a full two minutes during the debate, attracting a lot of attention online For the full gallery,click here. Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead. The debate on Wednesday was more substantive than when President Donald Trump and Joe Biden debated last week.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US media reports said the video was supposed to have been released a day earlier, but was ultimately made public just over three hours before Vice-President Mike Pence was scheduled to debate his Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris. Mr Trump, who has Covid-19, hasn't been seen in public since Monday. In the course of a 90-minute live debate, it's possible for even the most well-intentioned candidate to say something inaccurate. Luckily, our Reality Check team were watching where the errors crept in. Here's where both candidates got it wrongon coronavirus... and partly right on other claims. Soutik BiswasBBC News, Delhi Indians
have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister
Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâ criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his
foreign minister to meet a congressman who has been critical of the same
move. And although
Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration
friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will
be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian-American voters in these polarised times.

Despite the candidates' best efforts, nothing they said resonated with people online quite like the wanderings of one unsuspecting insect. For approximately two minutes, a fly landed on Vice-President Mike Pence's head and became an instant internet celebrity. The phrase ""the fly"" has been tweeted and retweeted more than 700,000 times since it appeared during the debate. The Biden campaign has taken full advantage, registering the domain ""flywillvote.com"", while a picture of Joe wielding a fly-swatter (or is it a horse whip?) has been liked more than 500,000 times.

In the absence of a physical spin room, where campaign 'surrogates', advisers and aides give their pitch for why their candidate won the debate, the campaign has held calls with reporters. Biden's communications director Liz Allen and senior adviser Symone Sanders say Harris was the only candidate on stage who presented a plan. Sanders accused Pence âmansplaining,â and âman-dodgingâ as he interrupted Harris and the debate moderator. The Biden camp said Harris will be back in Washington for Senate hearings next week, and refused to answer questions on whether the Democrats would try to expand the US Supreme Court if Trump's nominee is approved by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Here's a quick summary of the VP debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris:  During the debate, Harris voiced concerns about the Trump administration's attempt to change regulations to get a Covid-19 vaccination approved urgently. Democrats say Trump may try to push out dangerously untested therapies ahead of election day. ""If the doctors tell us we should take it I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,"" Harris said. ""But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not gonna take it."" Pence fires back that vaccine trials are moving at record speed, telling her to ""stop playing politics with people's lives"". This video can not be played Mike Pence: 'Stop playing politics with people's lives' Peter BowesNorth America correspondent For the most part this was a more orderly and respectful encounter than last weekâs debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.  But there were heated clashes between the two candidates, who were separated by two plexiglass dividers and seated almost four metres apart. Coronavirus dominated the first section, with Mike Pence accusing Kamala Harris of undermining public confidence when she said she would not take a vaccine if told to do so by President Trump. Pence avoided answering a question about whether heâd talked to the president about succeeding him, if he were to become too ill, or disabled, and unable to carry out his duties. Reality Check Defending the Trump administration's handling of the US economy, Vice-President Pence said: ""Right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs"". Thatâs roughly correct, although the unemployment rate is still significantly higher than it was prior to the pandemic. From March to April this year, more than 22.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Since then, around 11.4 million jobs have been added. The unemployment rate is currently 7.9%. It was 3.5% in February this year, before the coronavirus outbreak hit in the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The temporary closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland could cost thousands of jobs, industry leaders have warned. Licensed premises in five health board areas will close from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October. Elsewhere, they will have reduced opening hours and be barred from selling alcohol indoors. The Scottish government has said the new rules are needed to bring the virus back under control. It has argued that licensed premises are one of the key spreaders of Covid, and is making an additional Â£40m available for affected businesses. Industry leaders have criticised a lack of information about how the funding will be allocated - with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying more detail will be provided on Friday. Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Shoppers warned of return to supermarket queues Ms Sturgeon pointed to the country again having recorded more 1,000 new cases in a day as evidence that the ""hard and painful"" restrictions were needed to protect people's health. And she said the number of coronavirus patients in Scottish hospitals has doubled to 377 over the past week, with 31 being treated in intensive care. A further five people have died after testing positive for the virus. Pubs in some areas will still be able to sell alcohol outside Pubs and restaurants have questioned the scientific evidence behind the decision to shut down them down - and have claimed they were being unfairly singled out. UK Hospitality's executive director for Scotland, Willie Macleod, said many businesses would not survive the new measures - with a ""horrific"" impact on jobs. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Closing bars and restaurants is going to have a massive impact on businesses that are really just climbing back from a prolonged period of lockdown. ""They have reopened with reduced capacity to cope with social distancing, they were then hit by the 10pm curfew, and with reduced demand and reduced consumer confidence. Business resilience is as low as it can be. ""Many businesses won't survive and I'm afraid we're going to see tens of thousands of job losses by the time we do the final count on all of this."" Pubs across the central belt will have to close at 18:00 on Friday Pubs and restaurants will be closed in five health board areas -  Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran  - where about 3.4 million people live. Elsewhere in Scotland, hospitality venues can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food, while alcohol can be served in outside areas until 22:00. Some areas of England are expected have similar rules imposedover the coming days. Stephen Leckie, who runs the Crieff Hydro hotel, said he had 50 cancellations from customers within an hour of the first minister's announcement on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Leckie, who is also chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said the new measures had caused widespread confusion for business owners and customers. He said: ""This industry is in tatters, it's in trouble and now there's turmoil. We have questions to ask, many customers are asking questions and are cancelling in their droves."" Michael McHugh said he is at the end of his tether His views were echoed by Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, who said: ""These measures will sound the death knell for businesses across the hospitality sector, especially pubs and bars. ""Restaurants and hotels, whilst remaining open, will also be constrained on what they can provide and this will place a large dent in their already reduced income."" And pub owner Michael McHugh, who owns Alexander's Bar in Clydebank, said he was ""at the end of my tether"" and finding it increasingly difficult to reassure his staff that their jobs were safe. He added: ""How can you run a business when every other week you're getting shut down?"" Gretna hotelier Alasdair Houston said most of the industry, and its customers, had been behaving responsibly. ""Deal with the rule breakers; don't punish the rule followers by adding yet more and killing the sector,"" he said. ""The industry is being lumped together good with bad, and the primary problem is idiots breaking all the rules."" Crieff Hydro owner Stephen Leckie said there had been a raft of cancellations following the announcement Shops across Scotland will also be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said many shops would be baffled at the request ""in the absence of any evidence which shows shops are a source of infection"". He added: ""These additional restrictions may make it impractical for some to trade at all for this period, and the government must urgently provide details of the proposed support for these viable businesses."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions were needed to prevent the virus spreading to levels similar to the peak of the pandemic by the end of the month. She admitted that the restrictions would be hard on businesses, especially as employers' contributions to the furlough scheme have increased. Shops have been told to reintroduce 2m distancing and one-way systems Her deputy, John Swinney, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government had had to find the extra Â£40 to support the sector. He said: ""It is not extra resources we have had from the UK government, we have had to dig deep into our own resources to find the money to support the hospitality sector through what I accept is going to be a difficult period for them. ""But we are doing that because we must take wider action to protect the public interests in these circumstances."" He said the government has to ""stop the opportunities for interaction where the virus can spread, that appears to be emerging from some aspects of the hospitality sector"". All licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted Cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October Contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports Indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise Outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are being barred from selling alcohol indoors from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October They can open inside from 06:00 until 18:00 to sell soft drinks and food They will be able to sell alcohol for outside areas until 22:00 Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins (left) with actress Gal Gadot Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins has said that movie-going is facing a real threat of extinction. Her new superhero movie has been delayed three times during the coronavirus pandemic. She is among dozens of top Hollywood directors appealing to the US government to provide a financial lifeline to cinemas. Ms Jenkins's warning comes as cinemas in the UK are also struggling with a recent spate of delayed film releases. ""If we shut this down, this will not be a reversible process,"" she said in an interview with Reuters news agency. ""We could lose movie theatre-going forever."" Cinemas across the world are struggling financially with tough Covid-19 social restrictions limiting customers, along with a lack of blockbuster movies to attract them. In the US, the National Association of Theatre Owners said 69% of small and mid-sized cinema companies could be forced to file for bankruptcy or shut down permanently. America is the world's biggest movie market in terms of box office revenues, with China catching up rapidly. Odeon to open weekends-only at some cinemas New James Bond film pushed back - again 'My Cineworld job doesn't feel like work' Ms Jenkins said widespread closures would lead Hollywood studios to stop investing in films for cinemas, and turn to online streaming instead. ""It could be the kind of thing that happened to the music industry,"" she added. ""Where you could crumble the entire industry by making it something that can't be profitable."" Some of this year's major Hollywood films, including Walt Disney's Mulan, skipped cinemas and went straight to streaming. Ms Jenkins said that there is no option for her sequel, Wonder Woman 1984, to go straight to streaming. The superhero movie, starring Gal Gadot, is now scheduled for release on Christmas Day. That is a delay of six months from its original premiere date in June. This video can not be played As ever more people sign up to streaming services, are fewer going to the movies? Last week it was announced that the release of the new James Bond film has been delayed again. The premiere of No Time To Die had already been moved from April to November because of the pandemic. It is now scheduled for April 2021. Blockbuster remake Dune has also seen its release date delayed. The Warner Bros sci-fi epic was due for release in December but has been been pushed back to October 2021. Warner Bros has also delayed The Batman, now due in March 2022. In the UK, Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs.

"The UK has agreed to settle a lawsuit over how it selected an IT contract for coronavirus testing at its Lighthouse labs. The BBC understands that the settlement will cost the government up to Â£2m. British company Diagnostics AI claimed it lost out to a European rival UgenTec despite spotting some positive coronavirus cases its rival missed. It sued the government over the decision, claiming the selection process was ""unfair and unlawful"". Lighthouse labs are a UK-wide network of specialist coronavirus laboratories managed by the government and run by private firms. When the labs were set up, companies pitched to analyse the test results. Patients' access to vital NHS tests delayed by warehouse failure Coronavirus: How to get a Covid test Coronavirus: 'Children of the 90s' team to study exposure in young people The dispute was due to be played out in court. It would have meant a public examination of the accuracy and speed of the testing system, at a time when it has come under serious criticism. But the government has decided to settle the case and will pay Diagnostics AI compensation and most of its legal fees. However, despite agreeing to the payout, the government has refuted the claims made by Diagnostics AI, saying they are ""inaccurate"". ""The tests are reliable and effective, the laboratories that undertake them have been reviewed and assessed by experts and the percentage of false negatives or positives is tiny,"" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. ""This was a commercial dispute over a software contract where a number of factors were considered before it was awarded, which is still subject to final agreement over costs."" As the contract was worth more than Â£1m, the BBC understands the settlement including legal costs could amount to around Â£2m. Swabs are taken from people at testing sites or home tests and treated with a chemical process that produces a graph. The software is used to determine whether the graphs show the sample was positive or negative for coronavirus. Software is used to analyse swabs to determine whether a sample is positive or negative for coronavirus Diagnostics AI claimed UgenTec's analysis of a trial run of 2,000 samples was flawed. In some cases, it claimed UgenTec found negative coronavirus results, when the results were actually positive or inconclusive. ""The system that they ultimately went with and decided to pay for missed around 50 out of 800 positive [results], so that's around one in 15, or so, one in 16 - to be precise - positives,"" Diagnostics AI's chief executive Aron Cohen told the BBC. ""Obviously when that translates to hundreds of thousands of samples a day, that's potentially thousands of missed positives going out every day. So that was really worrying for us."" UgenTec in return claimed that no patients were affected at all as it was a trial run. ""We provide crucial covid interpretation services to the Lighthouse Labs to help them manage the vast amounts of data they generate. These claims are inaccurate and misleading,"" UgenTec's chief executive Steven Verhoeven told the BBC. ""None of these samples refer to actual results given to patients or the public and to imply any public health impact is wrong. Live tests were not being supported by our software at the time which was in the process of being implemented. As illustrated by independent tests, we have every confidence in our software and the services we provide."" Two non-profit companies owned and funded by the government were also sued by Diagnostics AI - namely UK Biocentre and Medicines Delivery Catapult (MDC), which ran the process to decide which company to use. Court papers show that between 31 March and 14 April, Diagnostics AI repeatedly requested information about exactly what services were required and how their bid would be evaluated. Diagnostics AI say it never received the information it asked for. This is refuted by UK Biocentre, which says both providers were given the same information. Local authorities are permitted to purchase services without engaging in a competitive process if there is a significant risk to life When the two bids were being considered in early April, the UK was facing what Boris Johnson had called a""moment of national emergency"". In such urgent circumstances,the law does make provision,externalfor the government to buy services without a competitive process, if certain conditions are met. However, it is understood that both Diagnostics AI and Ugentec had been recommended to UK Biocentre, and so a decision was made to evaluate both offers. Diagnostics AI says this process was unfair and flawed, but UK Biocentre insists it was fair to both bidders. A spokesperson for UK Biocentre said: ""The allegations are groundless; this was a commercial dispute. The software in question is being used widely in the Lighthouse Laboratories, in some NHS laboratories and abroad. ""External quality assurance has confirmed that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in the Lighthouse Laboratories, of which the automated diagnostic software forms part, is performing well."" A spokesperson for MDC also provided the BBC with a statement: ""The full results of evaluation identified UgenTec as a safe and quality provider, able to deliver in high volumes, and with a comprehensive support system in place. It has performed superbly over the past six months, analysing over eight million test results for the nation. The litigation was purely a commercial dispute."" The BBC understands that investigations were carried out into the claims made by Diagnostics AI, but concluded that concerns over the safety of UgenTec's software were unsubstantiated. However Mr Cohen disagrees: ""The government is paying out a lot of money. And they're paying this out, you know, to avoid it at least in part, to avoid having to have these issues aired in court, and to have discussions over the accuracy of the testing.""

Thanks for joining us as we try and make sense of things for you. If youâre catching up with the news, here are some of the headlines from around the world today: We're going to be bringing today's live coverage to an end soon. Here's what has been happening around the UK this Thursday:  A rise of 338,779 new coronavirus infections have been reported globally in the previous 24 hours, the biggest one-day increase since the pandemic began,according to World Health Organization (WHO) data,external. India registered the highest number of new cases with 78,524, followed by 41,906 in Brazil, and 38,904 in the US. The daily global increase in cases breaks the previous record of  330,340, set on 2 October. There were also an extra 5,514 deaths reported worldwide on Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1.05 million, the WHO reports. Rana JawadNorth Africa correspondent, Tunis The mayor of Tunisia's capital, Tunis, has said a night-time curfew will be reinstated for two weeks in a series of restrictions intended to control the spread of coronavirus, which has significantly risen in recent weeks. Since July there were only a few soft measures in place to control the rate of infection in Tunisia. But in the past month alone, more than 20,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The curfew will start on Thursday and run from 21:00 to 05:00 local time on weekdays, and 19:00 to 05:00 local time on weekends. Weekly markets and Friday prayers have also been banned, and cafes and restaurants can no longer have seated areas. The curfew will also be imposed in the neighbouring provinces of Manouba, Ariana, and Ben Arous. Four other cities, which have also seen a significant rise in Covid-19 cases, had already imposed a night curfew. There is a real worry that the countryâs health sector could significantly struggle if the infection rate does not slow down. But the Tunisian government has so far ruled out a return to a nationwide lockdown that was imposed earlier this year. The number of daily Covid-19 cases reported across Canada increased 40% in the last week compared with last, the country's top health official has announced, with the average daily case count hovering at some 2,000 infections. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last month that most of the country had entered its second wave. Canadians are now being encouraged to hunker down and stay home as this next wave worsens. The vast majority of new cases are concentrated in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. On Thursday,  Ontario reported 797 cases of the virus - the highest single day total since the start of the pandemic. The surge in cases comes just days before Canada's Thanksgiving weekend, typically a time for large, indoor family gatherings. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has encouraged residents to celebrate with just your own household this year. ""We're all going to make sacrifices... I know this will be very, very tough,"" he said. There is a âreasonably good chanceâ that an experimental antibody therapy helped President Donald Trump during his treatment for Covid-19, the top infectious diseases expert in the US has said. Dr Anthony Fauci was referring to a drug cocktail made by the company Regeneron. You can read more about this therapy, which mimics the body's immune response to fight the virus,here. In an interview with MSNBC, Dr Fauci said the therapy may have made a âsignificant differenceâ to Trumpâs condition, but warned against calling it a âcureâ, as the president has done. Dr Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also addressed claims President Trump made about the lethality of the flu compared with Covid-19. The health expert said the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 people in the US, is far more serious than seasonal flu. ""There is no doubt about that,"" Fauci said. On WednesdayFacebook removed a post in which Trump made claims to the contrary. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How do monoclonal antibodies work? Asda says it hopes the drive-through service will appeal to people worried about visiting their GP or pharmacy The supermarket Asda has launcheda free NHS drive-through flu vaccination servicefor eligible people at 13 UK stores. Anyone entitled to free jabs - including elderly people, frontline NHS staff and pregnant women - can use the service. People who do not qualify for the free vaccine can get it for Â£8, which Asda claims is the cheapest on the market. It comes after the government said up to 30 million people in England can be vaccinated against flu this year, in an effort to reduce the winter pressure on the NHS as Covid-19 cases rise. Pharmacies have said they face ""unprecedented demand"" and some suspended bookings for anyone outside the vulnerable groups who qualify for a free jab. Amid a new surge in coronavirus cases, New York City will close an additional 61 public schools, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday, bringing the total of newly shuttered schools to 169. They will remain closed until at least 21 October, the mayor said. City and state officials are now scrambling to respond to climbing cases, largely concentrated in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs, imposing strict attendance limits on schools, businesses and places of worship in virus hotspots. This recent crackdown - led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - has been met with outrage among Orthodox Jewish communities, who make up a large proportion of these hard-hit neighbourhoods. On Wednesday, hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men took to the streets for a second night of protests. Many without face coverings, those gathered clashed with police and burned face masks. Over the past week, the city has reported an average of some 566 cases a day - an increase of 61% from the average two weeks earlier, according to data from the New York Times. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The IMF says voluntary social distancing has partly driven the global economic downturn A new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has looked at the extent to which the global economic recession has been driven by voluntary social distancing and lockdown measures. Government restrictions on business and individuals to curb the pandemic come at an economic cost. The IMF research supports that view, but it also found that much of the downturn was due to voluntary social distancing. In other words, people choosing to avoid activities they feared might expose them to the risk of infection. The effect was particularly marked in rich countries where working from home is often more feasible. The report argues that while lockdowns impose short-term costs, they can generate a faster recovery if they lead to lower levels of infection and less voluntary distancing. The report acknowledges that the analysis neglects important side effects of lockdowns, including on educational attainment and mental health. It says these are crucial areas for future research.

The French cities of Lyon, Lille, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne will become maximum-alert zones for coronavirus from Saturday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran has announced. The coronavirus alert level was raised to maximum in Parisearlier this week and Marseille last month, leading to the closure of bars and restaurants. ""The situation has deteriorated in several metropolises in recent days,"" Veran said at a news conference on Thursday. âEvery day, more and more people are infected.â He said the alert level could soon be raised to maximum in Toulouse and Montpellier, which are seeing worrying spikes in infections. France's maximum alert level comes into force when the infection rate in a locality exceeds 250 infections per 100,000 people and at least 30% of intensive care beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients. Minutes before Vernan made his announcement, French health authorities reported 18,129 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, slightly lower than Wednesday's all-time high of 18,746 daily cases. Infections have risen rapidly since the end of summer in France, a trend seen across Europe as winter approaches. It's early evening in the UK. Here are the latest coronavirus news updates Masks are now mandatory in outdoor spaces in Italy Italy has recorded 4,458 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the biggest daily rise since mid-April when the country was under a national lockdown. It is the steepest 24-hour rise since 12 April, when 4,694 new infections were reported,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external. The Italian government managed to bring its coronavirus epidemic under control by imposing one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world from March. That lockdown inflicted heavy economic costs, but allowed the government to reopen restaurants, bars and shops by summer. But the virus is spreading once again, albeit at a steadier rate than during the first wave of the pandemic. On Thursday,the government made it mandatory to wear face masks in outdoor spacesto contain the spread of the coronavirus. People arriving in England from the Greek islands of Lesvos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos and Zakynthos will no longer need to self-isolate for 14 days from Saturday, the government has announced. The islands have been added to the list of travel corridors for England having been assessed by the Joint Biosecurity Centre as posing a lower infection risk. The quarantine rule for the islands will be lifted at 04:00 on 10 October. Zakynthos was the subject of controversy in August following reports of outbreaks in resorts popular with British tourists and after several clusters of Covid-19 infections were traced to UK-bound flights from the island. Kennedy and Nixon debated with 4,828km (3,000 miles) between them in 1960 As we reported earlier, US presidential debate organisers have decided to change the format of the next TV clash between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, opting for a virtual rather than an in-person event. Trump has scoffed at the proposal, dismissing the idea of a virtual debate as âridiculousâ. However, the format was acceptable to two former presidents, Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy, when they were vying for the White House in 1960. There was no coronavirus then, of course. But in their third debate of the campaign, Nixon and Kennedy went head-to-head, albeit via video link from different cities on the west and east coasts of the US.

"The prize launched by Sir David and Prince William is looking for ""brilliant"" projects to save the planet Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have joined forces to launch what they hope will become the ""Nobel Prize for environmentalism"". They say the search is on for 50 solutions to the world's gravest environmental problems by 2030. With Â£50m to be awarded over a decade, the ""Earthshot Prize"" is the biggest environmental prize ever. The Prince said ""positivity"" had been missing from the climate debate - something the award could supply. ""The Earthshot prize is really about harnessing that optimism and that urgency to find some of the world's solutions to some of the greatest environmental problems,"" he told the BBC. Anyone could win,he explained, as he called for ""amazing people"" to create ""brilliant innovative projects"". These, he said, could help save the planet. To mark the event BBC Radio 4's Today Programmehas secured an unprecedented exclusive joint interviewwith the Prince and Sir David. Attenborough: 'Curb excess capitalism' to save nature Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' This video can not be played Prince William launches the Earthshot Prize During the conversation Prince William said the launch of the new prize marks the moment he takes up the baton of environmental campaigning from his father. ""I feel right now it's my responsibility"", he said. The world is ""at a tipping point"", explained the Prince, who said the Earthshot Prize is his and Sir David's effort to ensure we hand the planet on to our children and grandchildren ""in a better state than we found it."" Nick Robinson quoted a Today interview with Prince Charles in which he had said sometimes his ideas on the environment were regarded as a bit ""dotty"". ""Was there a time when even you, I wonder, thought, what's my father banging on about?"", Mr Robinson asked the Prince. ""I regularly wonder what my father's banging on about. I'm sure every son thinks the same,"" Prince William replied. ""He's talked about this for a long time and long before people sort of cottoned on to climate change. So, I've always listened to and learnt and believed in what he was saying."" ""I think the dotty person now would be the person who doesn't believe in climate change,"" the Prince added. The Earthshot Prize will make five awards of Â£1m each year for 10 years. These ""Earthshots"" are intended as ""universal goals to repair our planet by 2030"" and will go to the best and most innovative ideas to help: Protect and restore nature Clean our air Revive our oceans Build a waste-free world â¢Fix our climate ""We hope that this Earthshot Prize reaches everyone around the world,"" the Prince told Radio 4. ""From communities, schools, right up to banks, governments, corporations - anyone and everyone is a part of this and anyone could find the solutions that we need."" Even suggestions that ""may sound crackpot"" are welcome, added Sir David, so long as they have the potential to make a difference on what he called ""the world scale"". The aim is to find ""new solutions"" that have a positive effect on environmental change and improve living standards globally, particularly those communities most at risk from climate change. ""There's a lot of people wanting to do many good things in the environment and what they need is a bit of a catalyst, a bit of hope, a bit of positivity that we can actually fix what's being presented"", Prince William said. The prize could go to a new technology, a new way of doing things or a new policy - basically any good idea. Individuals, community groups, scientists, activists, economists, leaders, government, banks, businesses, cities and even countries are welcome to submit their ideas to a nominating organisation. Coral bleaching is a major problem for the oceans - one of the prize categories The ""Earthshot"" name was chosen to echo the so-called ""Moonshot"": the huge US project to get the first person on the moon back in the 1960s when John F Kennedy was president. Prince William and Sir David Attenborough believe a similarly focussed effort - but this time global - is needed now to tackle environmental issues. The need for action never been more urgent, Sir David warned. ""Suddenly we actually see the writing is on the wall,"" he told Radio 4. We are already seeing the coral reefs dying, forests disappearing, the North Pole beginning to melt, he said. ""People can see it's happening and it is a matter of great urgency now."" Sir David said the aim is that the prize will give ideas ""that strength, that financial impetus to spread and be developed.""

Nominations will open on 1 November 2020 with an annual awards ceremony to be held in a different city each year, starting with London in autumn 2021. The Â£1m on offer is designed as an incentive for people to apply, but don't think you can book yourself a Caribbean holiday or buy yourself a Lamborghini if you win, the money must be spent on developing your idea and trying to get it taken up around the world. Prince William and Sir David will be joined on an ""Earthshot Prize Council"" by celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, sport, business, charity and the environment. They will act as ambassadors, giving publicity to the prize and its winners and helping motivate people around the world to environmental action. Meanwhile a coalition of individuals, businesses and organisations have provided the money for the prize and will help maximise the impact of the winners' ideas. Human-made fires designed to clear the Brazilian rainforest for cattle and crops ""Do you have a sense of how this fight can go on when you're no longer here?"" Mr Robinson asked Sir David, who celebrated his 94th birthday in May. The broadcaster said he believed there has been a global change in attitude to environmental issues. These days people don't just see it as a ""cranky, harmless interest"" but as ""a life and death issue."" ""The disaster we are facing is on a scale that has not been seen since mankind existed,"" Sir David said. Prince William said he aimed to take up the environmental baton from his father Prince Charles Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have set themselves the dizzyingly ambitious goal of ""repairing the planet by 2030"". So where will the potentially planet-saving ideas they want come from? The answer is we just don't know - you might have an idea that, with a bit of publicity and cash, could reshape our world. Which is why awarding prizes can be so effective: we can all apply. This video can not be played The renowned broadcaster says the excesses of capitalism must be ""curbed"" to help nature. The famous Longitude Prize, is a good example. It was offered way back in 1714 for the first person who could solve the problem of how to tell your longitude at sea. Knowing your longitude is crucial for navigation, it measures how far east or west you are, yet Britain's greatest seafarers and astronomers had failed to crack the problem. The solution came from such an unexpected source - a humble clockmaker called John Harrison - that the authorities refused to grant it for many years. Prince William hopes that similarly left-field ideas will be submitted for these ""Earthshots"". It is why Sir David Attenborough said even seemingly ""crackpot ideas"" are welcome. They know there is good evidence that the wider the pool of ideas, the more effective solutions are offered. Take the online forum InnoCentive. It allows people to post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions. Just as with the Earthshot Prize the aim is to call forth ""insights, flashes of genius and ideas"" from wherever they can. A study found the further the problem in question is from the people who come up with a workable solution, the more likely they are to solve it. Which is another way of saying we all might just hold the key to solving an environmental conundrum. And it explains why Prince William and Sir David Attenborough are saying don't hesitate to apply if you think you've got an idea that could help.

Here's what has been happening around the UK this Thursday:  A rise of 338,779 new coronavirus infections have been reported globally in the previous 24 hours, the biggest one-day increase since the pandemic began,according to World Health Organization (WHO) data,external. India registered the highest number of new cases with 78,524, followed by 41,906 in Brazil, and 38,904 in the US. The daily global increase in cases breaks the previous record of  330,340, set on 2 October. There were also an extra 5,514 deaths reported worldwide on Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1.05 million, the WHO reports. Rana JawadNorth Africa correspondent, Tunis The mayor of Tunisia's capital, Tunis, has said a night-time curfew will be reinstated for two weeks in a series of restrictions intended to control the spread of coronavirus, which has significantly risen in recent weeks. Since July there were only a few soft measures in place to control the rate of infection in Tunisia. But in the past month alone, more than 20,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The curfew will start on Thursday and run from 21:00 to 05:00 local time on weekdays, and 19:00 to 05:00 local time on weekends. Weekly markets and Friday prayers have also been banned, and cafes and restaurants can no longer have seated areas. The curfew will also be imposed in the neighbouring provinces of Manouba, Ariana, and Ben Arous. Four other cities, which have also seen a significant rise in Covid-19 cases, had already imposed a night curfew. There is a real worry that the countryâs health sector could significantly struggle if the infection rate does not slow down. But the Tunisian government has so far ruled out a return to a nationwide lockdown that was imposed earlier this year. The number of daily Covid-19 cases reported across Canada increased 40% in the last week compared with last, the country's top health official has announced, with the average daily case count hovering at some 2,000 infections. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last month that most of the country had entered its second wave. Canadians are now being encouraged to hunker down and stay home as this next wave worsens. The vast majority of new cases are concentrated in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. On Thursday,  Ontario reported 797 cases of the virus - the highest single day total since the start of the pandemic. The surge in cases comes just days before Canada's Thanksgiving weekend, typically a time for large, indoor family gatherings. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has encouraged residents to celebrate with just your own household this year. ""We're all going to make sacrifices... I know this will be very, very tough,"" he said. There is a âreasonably good chanceâ that an experimental antibody therapy helped President Donald Trump during his treatment for Covid-19, the top infectious diseases expert in the US has said. Dr Anthony Fauci was referring to a drug cocktail made by the company Regeneron. You can read more about this therapy, which mimics the body's immune response to fight the virus,here. In an interview with MSNBC, Dr Fauci said the therapy may have made a âsignificant differenceâ to Trumpâs condition, but warned against calling it a âcureâ, as the president has done. Dr Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also addressed claims President Trump made about the lethality of the flu compared with Covid-19. The health expert said the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 people in the US, is far more serious than seasonal flu. ""There is no doubt about that,"" Fauci said. On WednesdayFacebook removed a post in which Trump made claims to the contrary. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How do monoclonal antibodies work?

People who do not qualify for the free vaccine can get it for Â£8, which Asda claims is the cheapest on the market. It comes after the government said up to 30 million people in England can be vaccinated against flu this year, in an effort to reduce the winter pressure on the NHS as Covid-19 cases rise. Pharmacies have said they face ""unprecedented demand"" and some suspended bookings for anyone outside the vulnerable groups who qualify for a free jab.

It means that vulnerable people or those with mobility issues do not have to leave their homes to be tested.The council says troops are not present in a military capacity,externaland that there is no compulsion for anybody to accept a test kit.

"The inquiry focused on Huawei's telecoms kit rather than its consumer handset business There is ""clear evidence of collusion"" between Huawei and the ""Chinese Communist Party apparatus"", a parliamentary inquiry has concluded. And the MPs say the government may need to bring forward a deadline set for the Chinese firm's 5G kit to be removed from the UK's mobile networks. Huawei has responded by saying ""this report lacks credibility as it is built on opinion rather than fact"". But the latest accusation poses a further challenge to its business. Although the company's options in the UK are now limited, it is still trying to sell its 5G telecoms infrastructure to other parts of Europe and beyond, having invested heavily in the technology. ""We're sure people will see through these accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,"" a spokesman for the company said. The House of Commons defence committee based its findings on the testimony of academics, cyber-security experts and telecom industry insiders, among others. These included some long-term critics of the company. Hauwei's executives did not testify, although they did appear before a separate parliament committee in July. The report cites a venture capitalist who claimed the Chinese government ""had financed the growth of Huawei with some $75bn [Â£57bn] over the past three years"", which he said had allowed it to sell its hardware at a ""ridiculously low price point"". And it highlights a claim made by a researcher who specialises in corporate irregularities within China, who alleged that Huawei had ""engaged in a variety of intelligence, security, and intellectual property activities"" despite its repeated denials. ""It is clear that Huawei is strongly linked to the Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party, despite its statements to the contrary,"" the committee concludes. ""This is evidenced by its ownership model and the subsidies it has received."" The report warns that the West should not ""succumb to ill-informed anti-China hysteria"", but suggests some policy changes may be necessary. At present, the government has said mobile networks must not buy new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year, and then must remove any they have installed by 2027. But the committee says ministers should consider bringing the latter deadline forward to 2025 if relations with China deteriorate or pressure from the US and other allies makes it necessary. The MPs acknowledge being told by BT and Vodafone that such a move could cause signal blackouts in parts of the country. But they say operators could be compensated to minimise delays. They also say Beijing had exerted pressure through ""covert and overt threats"" to keep Huawei in the UK's 5G network. These are said to have included a suggestion it might block Chinese investment in the UK's nuclear industry. The committee says that if further threats follow, the government should ""carefully consider China's future presence in critical sectors of the economy"". And it recommends the forthcoming National Security and Investment Bill gives ministers the power to ban investments they deem risky. Huawei 'failed to improve UK security standards' Nokia clinches 5G deal with BT to phase out Huawei's kit in EE network UK and China relationship 'seriously poisoned', says Beijing's ambassador More work is needed to work with allies to ensure there are other suppliers of telecoms equipment, the report adds. And it calls on the government to avoid any further delay in introducing a telecoms bill to end what it describes as the current situation of ""commercial concerns trumping national security"". The MPs reject claims that Huawei's continued presence in the UK affects the country's ability to share sensitive information with partners. Last year, one US congressman suggestedthe US and UK might have to resort to using paper instead of electronic-based communications. But the committee says it is ""content"" that Huawei is sufficiently distanced from sensitive defence and national security sites, and in any case it would not be able to decipher encrypted data sent via its equipment. It does, however, urge GCHQ to continue its work with the firm at the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), where the firm's equipment is checked for flaws. Huawei funds the work done there by government experts and has indicated it is willing to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. The MPs say the government should now consider assessing equipment from ""other vendors in a similar fashion"". They also back proposals to form a D10 group of democracies to provide alternatives to Chinese technology. Little detail has been provided about what this might actually look like, and the committee calls on the government to consult allies to set out exactly what it would entail.

"The prize launched by Sir David and Prince William is looking for ""brilliant"" projects to save the planet Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have joined forces to launch what they hope will become the ""Nobel Prize for environmentalism"". They say the search is on for 50 solutions to the world's gravest environmental problems by 2030. With Â£50m to be awarded over a decade, the ""Earthshot Prize"" is the biggest environmental prize ever. The Prince said ""positivity"" had been missing from the climate debate - something the award could supply. ""The Earthshot prize is really about harnessing that optimism and that urgency to find some of the world's solutions to some of the greatest environmental problems,"" he told the BBC. Anyone could win,he explained, as he called for ""amazing people"" to create ""brilliant innovative projects"". These, he said, could help save the planet. To mark the event BBC Radio 4's Today Programmehas secured an unprecedented exclusive joint interviewwith the Prince and Sir David. Attenborough: 'Curb excess capitalism' to save nature Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' This video can not be played Prince William launches the Earthshot Prize During the conversation Prince William said the launch of the new prize marks the moment he takes up the baton of environmental campaigning from his father. ""I feel right now it's my responsibility"", he said. The world is ""at a tipping point"", explained the Prince, who said the Earthshot Prize is his and Sir David's effort to ensure we hand the planet on to our children and grandchildren ""in a better state than we found it."" Nick Robinson quoted a Today interview with Prince Charles in which he had said sometimes his ideas on the environment were regarded as a bit ""dotty"". ""Was there a time when even you, I wonder, thought, what's my father banging on about?"", Mr Robinson asked the Prince. ""I regularly wonder what my father's banging on about. I'm sure every son thinks the same,"" Prince William replied. ""He's talked about this for a long time and long before people sort of cottoned on to climate change. So, I've always listened to and learnt and believed in what he was saying."" ""I think the dotty person now would be the person who doesn't believe in climate change,"" the Prince added. The Earthshot Prize will make five awards of Â£1m each year for 10 years. These ""Earthshots"" are intended as ""universal goals to repair our planet by 2030"" and will go to the best and most innovative ideas to help: Protect and restore nature Clean our air Revive our oceans Build a waste-free world â¢Fix our climate ""We hope that this Earthshot Prize reaches everyone around the world,"" the Prince told Radio 4. ""From communities, schools, right up to banks, governments, corporations - anyone and everyone is a part of this and anyone could find the solutions that we need."" Even suggestions that ""may sound crackpot"" are welcome, added Sir David, so long as they have the potential to make a difference on what he called ""the world scale"". The aim is to find ""new solutions"" that have a positive effect on environmental change and improve living standards globally, particularly those communities most at risk from climate change. ""There's a lot of people wanting to do many good things in the environment and what they need is a bit of a catalyst, a bit of hope, a bit of positivity that we can actually fix what's being presented"", Prince William said. The prize could go to a new technology, a new way of doing things or a new policy - basically any good idea. Individuals, community groups, scientists, activists, economists, leaders, government, banks, businesses, cities and even countries are welcome to submit their ideas to a nominating organisation. Coral bleaching is a major problem for the oceans - one of the prize categories The ""Earthshot"" name was chosen to echo the so-called ""Moonshot"": the huge US project to get the first person on the moon back in the 1960s when John F Kennedy was president. Prince William and Sir David Attenborough believe a similarly focussed effort - but this time global - is needed now to tackle environmental issues. The need for action never been more urgent, Sir David warned. ""Suddenly we actually see the writing is on the wall,"" he told Radio 4. We are already seeing the coral reefs dying, forests disappearing, the North Pole beginning to melt, he said. ""People can see it's happening and it is a matter of great urgency now."" Sir David said the aim is that the prize will give ideas ""that strength, that financial impetus to spread and be developed.""

Nominations will open on 1 November 2020 with an annual awards ceremony to be held in a different city each year, starting with London in autumn 2021. The Â£1m on offer is designed as an incentive for people to apply, but don't think you can book yourself a Caribbean holiday or buy yourself a Lamborghini if you win, the money must be spent on developing your idea and trying to get it taken up around the world. Prince William and Sir David will be joined on an ""Earthshot Prize Council"" by celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, sport, business, charity and the environment. They will act as ambassadors, giving publicity to the prize and its winners and helping motivate people around the world to environmental action. Meanwhile a coalition of individuals, businesses and organisations have provided the money for the prize and will help maximise the impact of the winners' ideas. Human-made fires designed to clear the Brazilian rainforest for cattle and crops ""Do you have a sense of how this fight can go on when you're no longer here?"" Mr Robinson asked Sir David, who celebrated his 94th birthday in May. The broadcaster said he believed there has been a global change in attitude to environmental issues. These days people don't just see it as a ""cranky, harmless interest"" but as ""a life and death issue."" ""The disaster we are facing is on a scale that has not been seen since mankind existed,"" Sir David said. Prince William said he aimed to take up the environmental baton from his father Prince Charles Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have set themselves the dizzyingly ambitious goal of ""repairing the planet by 2030"". So where will the potentially planet-saving ideas they want come from? The answer is we just don't know - you might have an idea that, with a bit of publicity and cash, could reshape our world. Which is why awarding prizes can be so effective: we can all apply. This video can not be played The renowned broadcaster says the excesses of capitalism must be ""curbed"" to help nature. The famous Longitude Prize, is a good example. It was offered way back in 1714 for the first person who could solve the problem of how to tell your longitude at sea. Knowing your longitude is crucial for navigation, it measures how far east or west you are, yet Britain's greatest seafarers and astronomers had failed to crack the problem. The solution came from such an unexpected source - a humble clockmaker called John Harrison - that the authorities refused to grant it for many years. Prince William hopes that similarly left-field ideas will be submitted for these ""Earthshots"". It is why Sir David Attenborough said even seemingly ""crackpot ideas"" are welcome. They know there is good evidence that the wider the pool of ideas, the more effective solutions are offered. Take the online forum InnoCentive. It allows people to post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions. Just as with the Earthshot Prize the aim is to call forth ""insights, flashes of genius and ideas"" from wherever they can. A study found the further the problem in question is from the people who come up with a workable solution, the more likely they are to solve it. Which is another way of saying we all might just hold the key to solving an environmental conundrum. And it explains why Prince William and Sir David Attenborough are saying don't hesitate to apply if you think you've got an idea that could help.

"Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins (left) with actress Gal Gadot Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins has said that movie-going is facing a real threat of extinction. Her new superhero movie has been delayed three times during the coronavirus pandemic. She is among dozens of top Hollywood directors appealing to the US government to provide a financial lifeline to cinemas. Ms Jenkins's warning comes as cinemas in the UK are also struggling with a recent spate of delayed film releases. ""If we shut this down, this will not be a reversible process,"" she said in an interview with Reuters news agency. ""We could lose movie theatre-going forever."" Cinemas across the world are struggling financially with tough Covid-19 social restrictions limiting customers, along with a lack of blockbuster movies to attract them. In the US, the National Association of Theatre Owners said 69% of small and mid-sized cinema companies could be forced to file for bankruptcy or shut down permanently. America is the world's biggest movie market in terms of box office revenues, with China catching up rapidly. Odeon to open weekends-only at some cinemas New James Bond film pushed back - again 'My Cineworld job doesn't feel like work' Ms Jenkins said widespread closures would lead Hollywood studios to stop investing in films for cinemas, and turn to online streaming instead. ""It could be the kind of thing that happened to the music industry,"" she added. ""Where you could crumble the entire industry by making it something that can't be profitable."" Some of this year's major Hollywood films, including Walt Disney's Mulan, skipped cinemas and went straight to streaming. Ms Jenkins said that there is no option for her sequel, Wonder Woman 1984, to go straight to streaming. The superhero movie, starring Gal Gadot, is now scheduled for release on Christmas Day. That is a delay of six months from its original premiere date in June. This video can not be played As ever more people sign up to streaming services, are fewer going to the movies? Last week it was announced that the release of the new James Bond film has been delayed again. The premiere of No Time To Die had already been moved from April to November because of the pandemic. It is now scheduled for April 2021. Blockbuster remake Dune has also seen its release date delayed. The Warner Bros sci-fi epic was due for release in December but has been been pushed back to October 2021. Warner Bros has also delayed The Batman, now due in March 2022. In the UK, Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs.

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge. He said the experimental antibody cocktail he was given last week was a cure rather than a therapeutic measure, adding that hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready.  But Regeneron's drugs have not been approved by federal regulators. ""This was a blessing in disguise - I caught it, I heard about this drug, I said let me take it and it was incredible,"" he said, adding that he would seek emergency use authorisations for the drugs. President Trump renewed his attacks on China, telling Americans: ""You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault. And China is going to pay a big price. This was China's fault."" Earlier, Dr Conley said the president had not needed any supplemental oxygen since going to hospital on Friday. He was discharged on Monday. All the medication Trump is taking, explained Trump's healthcare v the average American's The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? Mr Trump's supporters say that he has shown leadership since his release from hospital. But his opponents say his behaviour has become increasingly erratic. The White House has also set out new safety measures after President Trump's return from hospital and the news that another aide had Covid-19. The presidential election is on 3 November. One key issue in the run-up to polling day is a coronavirus stimulus package for the economy. Mr Trump appeared to abandon negotiations with the Democrats on Tuesday, only to say later he would agree to some measures individually. ""His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range,""  a health report from Dr Conley said. This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House It added: ""The president's labs demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies on Monday October 5th."" Levels drawn last Thursday had shown ""undetectable"" antibodies. ""We'll continue to closely monitor and I will update you as I know more,"" the doctor said. The body makes antibodies to help fight the infection, and coronavirus antibodies in the blood indicate a person has had the virus. However, it remains unknown whether their presence will prevent the person getting the virus again. Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon to be briefed on Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico and the latest on talks with Democrats about a stimulus package for the economy, officials said. Mr Trump has been in a defiant mood since returning from hospital, angling to work in the Oval Office rather than in the Residence, as well as pushing for an address to the nation and a resumption of campaign activity. But many of his aides and staff remain in self-isolation. Earlier in the day, chief of staff Mark Meadows said that anyone interacting with Mr Trump had been wearing ""full PPE, masks, goggles and the like"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune"": Trump's controversial return to the White House A memo on Monday called for limited traffic on the first floor of the West Wing and at the Residence, with strict measures on protection equipment and hand sanitiser for anyone within six feet (two metres) of the president. Reports said there did appear to be much more mask-wearing at the White House, which had been criticised by many opponents for its lax attitude before Mr Trump's infection. Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. At least nine White House employees have tested positive but the cluster could be much higher. White House communications head Alyssa Farah with a mask. It does appear there are now stricter measures Some staff have expressed concern to US media that they were exposed without their knowledge to people who were known to be infected or were at risk of being Covid-positive. Leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the White House was ""one of the most dangerous places in the country"", adding she would ""not go anywhere near it"". Stephen Miller was the latest aide to test positive - on Tuesday. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and at least three other press staff have also been infected. Several senior military leaders are also quarantining after Coast Guard official Admiral Charles Ray tested positive. Opinion polls over the past week have suggested Mr Biden had a lead of between eight and 12 percentage points over Mr Trump nationwide, but it is likely the election will be decided in battleground states where the race is often closer. On Tuesday, Mr Trump saidhe was ending negotiations with the Democratsover a Covid-19 relief bill and would only resume talks after the election. After a negative stock market reaction, Mr Trump said he would support some stand-alone bills, later tweeting: ""Move fast, I am waiting to sign!"" a bill for $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheques to the American people. Mr Meadows said there were about ""10 things that we can do on a piecemeal basis"". Ms Pelosi said Mr Trump was ""rebounding from a terrible mistake"". She reportedly was in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday on the possibility of a bill to aid US airlines. Why won't White House say when Trump had last test?

It was apparently cut up as the 2.8m-long (9ft) scroll was deemed too long to display, said Hong Kong police. The original owner says the artwork's value has been ""definitely affected"". The scroll contains stanzas of poetry handwritten by the founder of the People's Republic of China. Its owner has claimed it is estimated to be worth around $300m (Â£230m), though it is not known how the valuation was obtained. The scroll was stolen in a massive heist on 10 September, when three men broke into the home of Fu Chunxiao, a well-known collector of stamps and revolutionary art. They also made off with antique stamps, copper coins and other pieces of calligraphy by Mao. The total haul was worth HK$5bn ($645m; Â£500m) according to Mr Fu, who was reportedly in mainland China when the burglary took place. The thieves sold one of the pieces to another art collector for just HK$500 ($64; Â£50) to a purchaser who, according to The South China Morning Post, believed the artwork was a fake. The buyer then saw a public appeal by police, and surrendered himself with both pieces of the scroll on 22 September. It is unclear who exactly had cut the artwork. Senior superintendent Tony Ho of the Hong Kong police said: ""Someone thought the calligraphy was too long... and difficult to show and display. That's why it was cut in half."" ""It was heartbreaking to see it be torn into two pieces,"" Mr Fu told the Post. ""It will definitely affect its value but the impact remains to be seen."" In 2019, a calligraphic autograph letter written by Mao Zedong wasauctioned off by Sotheby's for Â£519,000.,external Police later arrested the 49-year-old buyer on suspicion of handling stolen property, though he has now been released on bail. One suspected burglar has also been arrested, but the other two burglars who broke into Mr Fu's home still remain at large.

"The UK has agreed to settle a lawsuit over how it selected an IT contract for coronavirus testing at its Lighthouse labs. The BBC understands that the settlement will cost the government up to Â£2m. British company Diagnostics AI claimed it lost out to a European rival UgenTec despite spotting some positive coronavirus cases its rival missed. It sued the government over the decision, claiming the selection process was ""unfair and unlawful"". Lighthouse labs are a UK-wide network of specialist coronavirus laboratories managed by the government and run by private firms. When the labs were set up, companies pitched to analyse the test results. Patients' access to vital NHS tests delayed by warehouse failure Coronavirus: How to get a Covid test Coronavirus: 'Children of the 90s' team to study exposure in young people The dispute was due to be played out in court. It would have meant a public examination of the accuracy and speed of the testing system, at a time when it has come under serious criticism. But the government has decided to settle the case and will pay Diagnostics AI compensation and most of its legal fees. However, despite agreeing to the payout, the government has refuted the claims made by Diagnostics AI, saying they are ""inaccurate"". ""The tests are reliable and effective, the laboratories that undertake them have been reviewed and assessed by experts and the percentage of false negatives or positives is tiny,"" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. ""This was a commercial dispute over a software contract where a number of factors were considered before it was awarded, which is still subject to final agreement over costs."" As the contract was worth more than Â£1m, the BBC understands the settlement including legal costs could amount to around Â£2m. Swabs are taken from people at testing sites or home tests and treated with a chemical process that produces a graph. The software is used to determine whether the graphs show the sample was positive or negative for coronavirus. Software is used to analyse swabs to determine whether a sample is positive or negative for coronavirus Diagnostics AI claimed UgenTec's analysis of a trial run of 2,000 samples was flawed. In some cases, it claimed UgenTec found negative coronavirus results, when the results were actually positive or inconclusive. ""The system that they ultimately went with and decided to pay for missed around 50 out of 800 positive [results], so that's around one in 15, or so, one in 16 - to be precise - positives,"" Diagnostics AI's chief executive Aron Cohen told the BBC. ""Obviously when that translates to hundreds of thousands of samples a day, that's potentially thousands of missed positives going out every day. So that was really worrying for us."" UgenTec in return claimed that no patients were affected at all as it was a trial run. ""We provide crucial covid interpretation services to the Lighthouse Labs to help them manage the vast amounts of data they generate. These claims are inaccurate and misleading,"" UgenTec's chief executive Steven Verhoeven told the BBC. ""None of these samples refer to actual results given to patients or the public and to imply any public health impact is wrong. Live tests were not being supported by our software at the time which was in the process of being implemented. As illustrated by independent tests, we have every confidence in our software and the services we provide."" Two non-profit companies owned and funded by the government were also sued by Diagnostics AI - namely UK Biocentre and Medicines Delivery Catapult (MDC), which ran the process to decide which company to use. Court papers show that between 31 March and 14 April, Diagnostics AI repeatedly requested information about exactly what services were required and how their bid would be evaluated. Diagnostics AI say it never received the information it asked for. This is refuted by UK Biocentre, which says both providers were given the same information. Local authorities are permitted to purchase services without engaging in a competitive process if there is a significant risk to life When the two bids were being considered in early April, the UK was facing what Boris Johnson had called a""moment of national emergency"". In such urgent circumstances,the law does make provision,externalfor the government to buy services without a competitive process, if certain conditions are met. However, it is understood that both Diagnostics AI and Ugentec had been recommended to UK Biocentre, and so a decision was made to evaluate both offers. Diagnostics AI says this process was unfair and flawed, but UK Biocentre insists it was fair to both bidders. A spokesperson for UK Biocentre said: ""The allegations are groundless; this was a commercial dispute. The software in question is being used widely in the Lighthouse Laboratories, in some NHS laboratories and abroad. ""External quality assurance has confirmed that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in the Lighthouse Laboratories, of which the automated diagnostic software forms part, is performing well."" A spokesperson for MDC also provided the BBC with a statement: ""The full results of evaluation identified UgenTec as a safe and quality provider, able to deliver in high volumes, and with a comprehensive support system in place. It has performed superbly over the past six months, analysing over eight million test results for the nation. The litigation was purely a commercial dispute."" The BBC understands that investigations were carried out into the claims made by Diagnostics AI, but concluded that concerns over the safety of UgenTec's software were unsubstantiated. However Mr Cohen disagrees: ""The government is paying out a lot of money. And they're paying this out, you know, to avoid it at least in part, to avoid having to have these issues aired in court, and to have discussions over the accuracy of the testing.""

"The prize launched by Sir David and Prince William is looking for ""brilliant"" projects to save the planet Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have joined forces to launch what they hope will become the ""Nobel Prize for environmentalism"". They say the search is on for 50 solutions to the world's gravest environmental problems by 2030. With Â£50m to be awarded over a decade, the ""Earthshot Prize"" is the biggest environmental prize ever. The Prince said ""positivity"" had been missing from the climate debate - something the award could supply. ""The Earthshot prize is really about harnessing that optimism and that urgency to find some of the world's solutions to some of the greatest environmental problems,"" he told the BBC. Anyone could win,he explained, as he called for ""amazing people"" to create ""brilliant innovative projects"". These, he said, could help save the planet. To mark the event BBC Radio 4's Today Programmehas secured an unprecedented exclusive joint interviewwith the Prince and Sir David. Attenborough: 'Curb excess capitalism' to save nature Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' This video can not be played Prince William launches the Earthshot Prize During the conversation Prince William said the launch of the new prize marks the moment he takes up the baton of environmental campaigning from his father. ""I feel right now it's my responsibility"", he said. The world is ""at a tipping point"", explained the Prince, who said the Earthshot Prize is his and Sir David's effort to ensure we hand the planet on to our children and grandchildren ""in a better state than we found it."" Nick Robinson quoted a Today interview with Prince Charles in which he had said sometimes his ideas on the environment were regarded as a bit ""dotty"". ""Was there a time when even you, I wonder, thought, what's my father banging on about?"", Mr Robinson asked the Prince. ""I regularly wonder what my father's banging on about. I'm sure every son thinks the same,"" Prince William replied. ""He's talked about this for a long time and long before people sort of cottoned on to climate change. So, I've always listened to and learnt and believed in what he was saying."" ""I think the dotty person now would be the person who doesn't believe in climate change,"" the Prince added. The Earthshot Prize will make five awards of Â£1m each year for 10 years. These ""Earthshots"" are intended as ""universal goals to repair our planet by 2030"" and will go to the best and most innovative ideas to help: Protect and restore nature Clean our air Revive our oceans Build a waste-free world â¢Fix our climate ""We hope that this Earthshot Prize reaches everyone around the world,"" the Prince told Radio 4. ""From communities, schools, right up to banks, governments, corporations - anyone and everyone is a part of this and anyone could find the solutions that we need."" Even suggestions that ""may sound crackpot"" are welcome, added Sir David, so long as they have the potential to make a difference on what he called ""the world scale"". The aim is to find ""new solutions"" that have a positive effect on environmental change and improve living standards globally, particularly those communities most at risk from climate change. ""There's a lot of people wanting to do many good things in the environment and what they need is a bit of a catalyst, a bit of hope, a bit of positivity that we can actually fix what's being presented"", Prince William said. The prize could go to a new technology, a new way of doing things or a new policy - basically any good idea. Individuals, community groups, scientists, activists, economists, leaders, government, banks, businesses, cities and even countries are welcome to submit their ideas to a nominating organisation. Coral bleaching is a major problem for the oceans - one of the prize categories The ""Earthshot"" name was chosen to echo the so-called ""Moonshot"": the huge US project to get the first person on the moon back in the 1960s when John F Kennedy was president. Prince William and Sir David Attenborough believe a similarly focussed effort - but this time global - is needed now to tackle environmental issues. The need for action never been more urgent, Sir David warned. ""Suddenly we actually see the writing is on the wall,"" he told Radio 4. We are already seeing the coral reefs dying, forests disappearing, the North Pole beginning to melt, he said. ""People can see it's happening and it is a matter of great urgency now."" Sir David said the aim is that the prize will give ideas ""that strength, that financial impetus to spread and be developed.""

Nominations will open on 1 November 2020 with an annual awards ceremony to be held in a different city each year, starting with London in autumn 2021. The Â£1m on offer is designed as an incentive for people to apply, but don't think you can book yourself a Caribbean holiday or buy yourself a Lamborghini if you win, the money must be spent on developing your idea and trying to get it taken up around the world. Prince William and Sir David will be joined on an ""Earthshot Prize Council"" by celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, sport, business, charity and the environment. They will act as ambassadors, giving publicity to the prize and its winners and helping motivate people around the world to environmental action. Meanwhile a coalition of individuals, businesses and organisations have provided the money for the prize and will help maximise the impact of the winners' ideas. Human-made fires designed to clear the Brazilian rainforest for cattle and crops ""Do you have a sense of how this fight can go on when you're no longer here?"" Mr Robinson asked Sir David, who celebrated his 94th birthday in May. The broadcaster said he believed there has been a global change in attitude to environmental issues. These days people don't just see it as a ""cranky, harmless interest"" but as ""a life and death issue."" ""The disaster we are facing is on a scale that has not been seen since mankind existed,"" Sir David said. Prince William said he aimed to take up the environmental baton from his father Prince Charles Prince William and Sir David Attenborough have set themselves the dizzyingly ambitious goal of ""repairing the planet by 2030"". So where will the potentially planet-saving ideas they want come from? The answer is we just don't know - you might have an idea that, with a bit of publicity and cash, could reshape our world. Which is why awarding prizes can be so effective: we can all apply. This video can not be played The renowned broadcaster says the excesses of capitalism must be ""curbed"" to help nature. The famous Longitude Prize, is a good example. It was offered way back in 1714 for the first person who could solve the problem of how to tell your longitude at sea. Knowing your longitude is crucial for navigation, it measures how far east or west you are, yet Britain's greatest seafarers and astronomers had failed to crack the problem. The solution came from such an unexpected source - a humble clockmaker called John Harrison - that the authorities refused to grant it for many years. Prince William hopes that similarly left-field ideas will be submitted for these ""Earthshots"". It is why Sir David Attenborough said even seemingly ""crackpot ideas"" are welcome. They know there is good evidence that the wider the pool of ideas, the more effective solutions are offered. Take the online forum InnoCentive. It allows people to post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions. Just as with the Earthshot Prize the aim is to call forth ""insights, flashes of genius and ideas"" from wherever they can. A study found the further the problem in question is from the people who come up with a workable solution, the more likely they are to solve it. Which is another way of saying we all might just hold the key to solving an environmental conundrum. And it explains why Prince William and Sir David Attenborough are saying don't hesitate to apply if you think you've got an idea that could help.

"Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence debated in Salt Lake City, Utah It was more civil than last week's chaotic event at the top of the ticket and had more policy discussions Pence defended the US response to Covid-19, which has killed 200,000 Americans Harris called it ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country"" They also tangled over taxes, with Pence accusing Harris of a tax hike on working people, which she denies The duo on stage were separated by glass barriers as a precaution for the pandemic A fly landing on Pence's head during the debate provided a little light relief for thousands on social media Edited by Helier Cheung Thanks for following our live reporting on the US election vice-presidential debate - we're bringing it to a close now. Here's a recap of what we saw and heard on Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah:  For more, you canread our reporter Anthony Zurcher's five takeaways from the debate. We'll be back next week with live coverage of the second presidential debate, and in the meantime you can also follow ourlive coronavirus coverage here.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years. Read more:Five takeaways from the VP debate Amid all the coverage of the debate, you might have missed this news from Facebook. The social media platform has announced a new series of measures regarding the US election. Noting that final election results may take longer to come in than usual due to the pandemic and postal voting, the social media giant said on Wednesday it was trying to ""prevent the spread of misinformation"". New measures include: - Notifications on posts saying the count is ongoing, if a ""candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". - Banning content that ""seeks to intimidate voters"", including ""calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarised language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate"". - Not running political or social issues adverts after the polls close on Election Day Facebook recently banned adverts seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"".

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US media reports said the video was supposed to have been released a day earlier, but was ultimately made public just over three hours before Vice-President Mike Pence was scheduled to debate his Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris. Mr Trump, who has Covid-19, hasn't been seen in public since Monday. In the course of a 90-minute live debate, it's possible for even the most well-intentioned candidate to say something inaccurate. Luckily, our Reality Check team were watching where the errors crept in. Here's where both candidates got it wrongon coronavirus... and partly right on other claims. Soutik BiswasBBC News, Delhi Indians
have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister
Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâ criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his
foreign minister to meet a congressman who has been critical of the same
move. And although
Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration
friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will
be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian-American voters in these polarised times.

Despite the candidates' best efforts, nothing they said resonated with people online quite like the wanderings of one unsuspecting insect. For approximately two minutes, a fly landed on Vice-President Mike Pence's head and became an instant internet celebrity. The phrase ""the fly"" has been tweeted and retweeted more than 700,000 times since it appeared during the debate.

In the absence of a physical spin room, where campaign 'surrogates', advisers and aides give their pitch for why their candidate won the debate, the campaign has held calls with reporters. Biden's communications director Liz Allen and senior adviser Symone Sanders say Harris was the only candidate on stage who presented a plan. Sanders accused Pence âmansplaining,â and âman-dodgingâ as he interrupted Harris and the debate moderator. The Biden camp said Harris will be back in Washington for Senate hearings next week, and refused to answer questions on whether the Democrats would try to expand the US Supreme Court if Trump's nominee is approved by the Republican-controlled Senate. Read more: Who is Trump's Supreme Court pick? If you're just waking up in Europe, or catching up at lunchtime in Asia - welcome! Here's a quick summary of the VP debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris:  During the debate, Harris voiced concerns about the Trump administration's attempt to change regulations to get a Covid-19 vaccination approved urgently. Democrats say Trump may try to push out dangerously untested therapies ahead of election day.

This video can not be played Mike Pence: 'Stop playing politics with people's lives' Peter BowesNorth America correspondent For the most part this was a more orderly and respectful encounter than last weekâs debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.  But there were heated clashes between the two candidates, who were separated by two plexiglass dividers and seated almost four metres apart. Coronavirus dominated the first section, with Mike Pence accusing Kamala Harris of undermining public confidence when she said she would not take a vaccine if told to do so by President Trump. Pence avoided answering a question about whether heâd talked to the president about succeeding him, if he were to become too ill, or disabled, and unable to carry out his duties. Reality Check Defending the Trump administration's handling of the US economy, Vice-President Pence said: ""Right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs"". Thatâs roughly correct, although the unemployment rate is still significantly higher than it was prior to the pandemic. From March to April this year, more than 22.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Since then, around 11.4 million jobs have been added. The unemployment rate is currently 7.9%. It was 3.5% in February this year, before the coronavirus outbreak hit in the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge. He said the experimental antibody cocktail he was given last week was a cure rather than a therapeutic measure, adding that hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready.  But Regeneron's drugs have not been approved by federal regulators. ""This was a blessing in disguise - I caught it, I heard about this drug, I said let me take it and it was incredible,"" he said, adding that he would seek emergency use authorisations for the drugs. President Trump renewed his attacks on China, telling Americans: ""You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault. And China is going to pay a big price. This was China's fault."" Earlier, Dr Conley said the president had not needed any supplemental oxygen since going to hospital on Friday. He was discharged on Monday. All the medication Trump is taking, explained Trump's healthcare v the average American's The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? Mr Trump's supporters say that he has shown leadership since his release from hospital. But his opponents say his behaviour has become increasingly erratic. The White House has also set out new safety measures after President Trump's return from hospital and the news that another aide had Covid-19. The presidential election is on 3 November. One key issue in the run-up to polling day is a coronavirus stimulus package for the economy. Mr Trump appeared to abandon negotiations with the Democrats on Tuesday, only to say later he would agree to some measures individually. ""His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range,""  a health report from Dr Conley said. This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House It added: ""The president's labs demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies on Monday October 5th."" Levels drawn last Thursday had shown ""undetectable"" antibodies. ""We'll continue to closely monitor and I will update you as I know more,"" the doctor said. The body makes antibodies to help fight the infection, and coronavirus antibodies in the blood indicate a person has had the virus. However, it remains unknown whether their presence will prevent the person getting the virus again. Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon to be briefed on Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico and the latest on talks with Democrats about a stimulus package for the economy, officials said. Mr Trump has been in a defiant mood since returning from hospital, angling to work in the Oval Office rather than in the Residence, as well as pushing for an address to the nation and a resumption of campaign activity. But many of his aides and staff remain in self-isolation. Earlier in the day, chief of staff Mark Meadows said that anyone interacting with Mr Trump had been wearing ""full PPE, masks, goggles and the like"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune"": Trump's controversial return to the White House A memo on Monday called for limited traffic on the first floor of the West Wing and at the Residence, with strict measures on protection equipment and hand sanitiser for anyone within six feet (two metres) of the president. Reports said there did appear to be much more mask-wearing at the White House, which had been criticised by many opponents for its lax attitude before Mr Trump's infection. Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. At least nine White House employees have tested positive but the cluster could be much higher. White House communications head Alyssa Farah with a mask. It does appear there are now stricter measures Some staff have expressed concern to US media that they were exposed without their knowledge to people who were known to be infected or were at risk of being Covid-positive. Leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the White House was ""one of the most dangerous places in the country"", adding she would ""not go anywhere near it"". Stephen Miller was the latest aide to test positive - on Tuesday. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and at least three other press staff have also been infected. Several senior military leaders are also quarantining after Coast Guard official Admiral Charles Ray tested positive. Opinion polls over the past week have suggested Mr Biden had a lead of between eight and 12 percentage points over Mr Trump nationwide, but it is likely the election will be decided in battleground states where the race is often closer. On Tuesday, Mr Trump saidhe was ending negotiations with the Democratsover a Covid-19 relief bill and would only resume talks after the election. After a negative stock market reaction, Mr Trump said he would support some stand-alone bills, later tweeting: ""Move fast, I am waiting to sign!"" a bill for $1,200 (Â£930) stimulus cheques to the American people. Mr Meadows said there were about ""10 things that we can do on a piecemeal basis"". Ms Pelosi said Mr Trump was ""rebounding from a terrible mistake"".

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years.

The social media platform has announced a new series of measures regarding the US election. Noting that final election results may take longer to come in than usual due to the pandemic and postal voting, the social media giant said on Wednesday it was trying to ""prevent the spread of misinformation"". New measures include: - Notifications on posts saying the count is ongoing, if a ""candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". - Banning content that ""seeks to intimidate voters"", including ""calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarised language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate"". - Not running political or social issues adverts after the polls close on Election Day Facebook recently banned adverts seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"".

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead. The debate on Wednesday was more substantive than when President Donald Trump and Joe Biden debated last week.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US media reports said the video was supposed to have been released a day earlier, but was ultimately made public just over three hours before Vice-President Mike Pence was scheduled to debate his Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris. Mr Trump, who has Covid-19, hasn't been seen in public since Monday. In the course of a 90-minute live debate, it's possible for even the most well-intentioned candidate to say something inaccurate. Luckily, our Reality Check team were watching where the errors crept in. Here's where both candidates got it wrongon coronavirus... and partly right on other claims. Soutik BiswasBBC News, Delhi Indians
have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister
Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâ criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his
foreign minister to meet a congressman who has been critical of the same
move. And although
Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration
friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will
be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian-American voters in these polarised times.

This video can not be played Okay, we have to explain about the fly. Despite the candidates' best efforts, nothing they said resonated with people online quite like the wanderings of one unsuspecting insect. For approximately two minutes, a fly landed on Vice-President Mike Pence's head and became an instant internet celebrity. The phrase ""the fly"" has been tweeted and retweeted more than 700,000 times since it appeared during the debate. The Biden campaign has taken full advantage, registering the domain ""flywillvote.com"", while a picture of Joe wielding a fly-swatter (or is it a horse whip?) has been liked more than 500,000 times.

In the absence of a physical spin room, where campaign 'surrogates', advisers and aides give their pitch for why their candidate won the debate, the campaign has held calls with reporters. Biden's communications director Liz Allen and senior adviser Symone Sanders say Harris was the only candidate on stage who presented a plan. Sanders accused Pence âmansplaining,â and âman-dodgingâ as he interrupted Harris and the debate moderator. The Biden camp said Harris will be back in Washington for Senate hearings next week, and refused to answer questions on whether the Democrats would try to expand the US Supreme Court if Trump's nominee is approved by the Republican-controlled Senate. Read more: Who is Trump's Supreme Court pick? If you're just waking up in Europe, or catching up at lunchtime in Asia - welcome! Here's a quick summary of the VP debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris:  During the debate, Harris voiced concerns about the Trump administration's attempt to change regulations to get a Covid-19 vaccination approved urgently. Democrats say Trump may try to push out dangerously untested therapies ahead of election day. ""If the doctors tell us we should take it I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,"" Harris said. ""But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not gonna take it.""

Thatâs roughly correct, although the unemployment rate is still significantly higher than it was prior to the pandemic. From March to April this year, more than 22.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Since then, around 11.4 million jobs have been added. The unemployment rate is currently 7.9%.

"This video can not be played Dodging questions and interruptions: While the VP debate was more civil, there were still moments of tension The contenders for US vice-president have clashed over the coronavirus pandemic in their only debate ahead of next month's election. Democrat Kamala Harris called Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration"" in history. Vice-President Mike Pence, a Republican, said the Democratic Party's pandemic plan amounted to ""plagiarism"". Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads Mr Trump with 26 days to go to the vote. Opinion polls indicate the Republican president is trailing by single digits in a handful of battleground states that will decide who wins. Vice-presidents have tie-breaking power in the Senate and are required to step in if a president is unable to perform their duties. Their day-to-day responsibilities vary with each administration, but they typically serve as top advisers and some take on specific policy portfolios. Wednesday night's meeting was a civil debate between two smooth communicators compared to last week's belligerent showdown between Mr Trump and Mr Biden, which degenerated into insults and name-calling. Mr Pence did not interrupt as much as the president last week, but when he did, Ms Harris interjected: ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking, I'm speaking."" The viral moment on Wednesday was a fly landing on Mr Pence's head and remaining there for some two minutes. But there were heated exchanges. Debate reaction and analysis What did we learn from the debate? Fly generates most buzz from VP debate US vice-presidential debate claims fact-checked The 90-minute televised debate at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City was marked by disagreements over the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. Ms Harris accused Mr Pence and the president of deliberately misleading Americans about the lethality of coronavirus. ""They knew, and they covered it up,"" she said, adding that they had ""forfeited their right to re-election"". Mr Pence accused the Biden-Harris campaign of copying the White House's pandemic strategy, alluding to a blunder that ended Mr Biden's 1987 run for the presidency when he plagiarised a speech by then-British Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Ms Harris was asked by the moderator whether she would take an approved Covid-19 vaccine distributed ahead of the election. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The 55-year-old California senator said she would not take a jab touted by Mr Trump without the say-so of medical professionals. Mr Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, retorted: ""The fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration I think is unconscionable."" The plexiglass barriers separating the two debaters seated 12ft (3.6m) apart were a vivid reminder of the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans. The president - who is himself recovering from the virus - returned to the White House on Monday evening after three nights in hospital, with his opinion poll numbers drooping. On Wednesday he declared that catching the disease was a ""blessing from God"" that exposed to him to experimental treatments he vowed would become free for all Americans. Who is Vice-President Mike Pence? Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? In pictures: Harris v Pence debate The virus, meanwhile, has spread through the West Wing of the White House and infected figures inside the president's re-election campaign. ABC News reported that an internal government memo, dated Wednesday, said""34 White House staffers and other contacts"" had been infected in recent days,external. The White House has not yet commented on this. Vice-presidential debates seldom shake up presidential races, and the face-off between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence on Wednesday night seems destined to be no different. Both candidates had strong moments, and a few stumbles, over the course of the 90-minute affair. But as far as lasting memories go, they were few and far between. If this was a match that showcased the futures of the Democratic and Republican parties, the real fireworks will have to wait for the coming years. An unmemorable result, in and of itself, is good news for the Democrats and Joe Biden, who polls suggest are leading in the race. One more campaign set-piece in the books, and one step closer to election day. Read Anthony's key takeaways in full On the question of racial justice, Mr Pence expressed shock at the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. But he added: ""There is no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed."" He pointed to one of his guests in the auditorium, Flora Westbrooks, a black woman whose hair studio was destroyed during unrest in Minneapolis. This video can not be played Harris: 'If you have a pre-existing condition, they're coming for you' He said Mr Biden and Ms Harris's claim that America is systemically racist and that police have an implicit bias against minorities is ""a great insult"". Ms Harris - who was making history by becoming the first black woman to stand on a vice-presidential debate stage - said: ""Last week the president of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists."" A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? ""Not true, not true,"" said Mr Pence, arguing that when Ms Harris was a prosecutor in San Francisco African Americans were more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offences than whites or Latinos. This video can not be played The most talked about guest to take to the stage was also the smallest Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? What Joe Biden wants to do Full coverage of the US election In other key flashpoints: Ms Harris said the Trump tit-for-tat tariffs on China had caused a manufacturing recession, adding: ""You lost that trade war. You lost it."" Mr Pence hit back: ""Lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden's been a cheerleader for communist China through... the last several decades"" Ms Harris assailed Mr Trump for paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president, according to a New York Times investigation. ""When I first heard about it, I literally said, 'You mean $750,000?' And it was like, 'No, $750'"" Ms Harris said Mr Trump had ""betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world"". Mr Pence said Mr Trump had ordered operations that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani The debate was notable for the questions that the candidates did not directly answer. Mr Pence twice pressed Ms Harris on whether Mr Biden would expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court, which has had nine justices for a century and a half, but she spoke instead aboutMr Trump's current judicial nominee. The Constitution does not say how many justices there must be on the Supreme Court, so if a president and Congress were to agree they could change the law to expand or shrink it. Some Democrats have suggested doing this amid arguments over Mr Trump's nominee, whose confirmation would cement a right-leaning majority on the top court.  Mr Biden has not said whether he would support expanding the court if he became president. Mr Pence - a mild mannered former Indiana governor known for his steadfast loyalty to Mr Trump - did not answer questions about whether he would want his home state of Indiana to ban abortion, or how the Trump administration would ensure medical coverage for sick Americans. This video can not be played Harris and Pence âdodge questionsâ during the vice-presidential debate in Utah Focus on the running mates has intensified given 74-year-old Mr Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis, and the fact that Mr Biden would be the oldest president ever to take office at 78. But when asked by the debate moderator about the chances of them taking over the presidency, both candidates skirted the subject. Mr Pence, 61, assailed Mr Biden's handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, and Ms Harris - the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father - spoke of her own biography. Shloka Ananthanarayanan (Democrat):""I wouldn't necessarily say there was one moment that stood out, but what stood out was the tone and the fact that no one was yelling at each other during this debate."" Jim Sullivan (Republican):""Given the age of the two candidates, the vice-presidential pick this time around is pretty significant. Last week was just distressing, so this was a real breath of fresh air. I don't agree with Kamala Harris on a lot of things, but they both handled themselves well and I liked the format."" Akayla Sellers (Democrat):""They could have discussed a lot more in depth about healthcare, education and the racial uproar. You see a lot of people crowding the streets, they are the younger generation and they didn't discuss that in depth."" Gordon Kou (Republican):""They did a better job of defending their candidates than the actual candidates did. Overall, the winner was America because we somewhat saved face after the debacle last week.""

The editors were Vicky Baker, Matthew Davis and Helier Cheung.   Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years.

The social media platform has announced a new series of measures regarding the US election. Noting that final election results may take longer to come in than usual due to the pandemic and postal voting, the social media giant said on Wednesday it was trying to ""prevent the spread of misinformation"". New measures include: - Notifications on posts saying the count is ongoing, if a ""candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". - Banning content that ""seeks to intimidate voters"", including ""calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarised language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate"". - Not running political or social issues adverts after the polls close on Election Day Facebook recently banned adverts seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"".

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead. The debate on Wednesday was more substantive than when President Donald Trump and Joe Biden debated last week.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New measures include: - Notifications on posts saying the count is ongoing, if a ""candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"". - Banning content that ""seeks to intimidate voters"", including ""calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarised language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate"". - Not running political or social issues adverts after the polls close on Election Day Facebook recently banned adverts seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"".

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead. The debate on Wednesday was more substantive than when President Donald Trump and Joe Biden debated last week.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US media reports said the video was supposed to have been released a day earlier, but was ultimately made public just over three hours before Vice-President Mike Pence was scheduled to debate his Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris. Mr Trump, who has Covid-19, hasn't been seen in public since Monday. In the course of a 90-minute live debate, it's possible for even the most well-intentioned candidate to say something inaccurate. Luckily, our Reality Check team were watching where the errors crept in. Here's where both candidates got it wrongon coronavirus... and partly right on other claims. Soutik BiswasBBC News, Delhi Indians
have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister
Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâ criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his
foreign minister to meet a congressman who has been critical of the same
move. And although
Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration
friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will
be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian-American voters in these polarised times.

This video can not be played Okay, we have to explain about the fly. Despite the candidates' best efforts, nothing they said resonated with people online quite like the wanderings of one unsuspecting insect. For approximately two minutes, a fly landed on Vice-President Mike Pence's head and became an instant internet celebrity. The phrase ""the fly"" has been tweeted and retweeted more than 700,000 times since it appeared during the debate. The Biden campaign has taken full advantage, registering the domain ""flywillvote.com"", while a picture of Joe wielding a fly-swatter (or is it a horse whip?) has been liked more than 500,000 times.

In the absence of a physical spin room, where campaign 'surrogates', advisers and aides give their pitch for why their candidate won the debate, the campaign has held calls with reporters. Biden's communications director Liz Allen and senior adviser Symone Sanders say Harris was the only candidate on stage who presented a plan. Sanders accused Pence âmansplaining,â and âman-dodgingâ as he interrupted Harris and the debate moderator. The Biden camp said Harris will be back in Washington for Senate hearings next week, and refused to answer questions on whether the Democrats would try to expand the US Supreme Court if Trump's nominee is approved by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Here's a quick summary of the VP debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris:  During the debate, Harris voiced concerns about the Trump administration's attempt to change regulations to get a Covid-19 vaccination approved urgently. Democrats say Trump may try to push out dangerously untested therapies ahead of election day. ""If the doctors tell us we should take it I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,"" Harris said. ""But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not gonna take it."" Pence fires back that vaccine trials are moving at record speed, telling her to ""stop playing politics with people's lives"". This video can not be played Mike Pence: 'Stop playing politics with people's lives' Peter BowesNorth America correspondent For the most part this was a more orderly and respectful encounter than last weekâs debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.  But there were heated clashes between the two candidates, who were separated by two plexiglass dividers and seated almost four metres apart. Coronavirus dominated the first section, with Mike Pence accusing Kamala Harris of undermining public confidence when she said she would not take a vaccine if told to do so by President Trump. Pence avoided answering a question about whether heâd talked to the president about succeeding him, if he were to become too ill, or disabled, and unable to carry out his duties. Reality Check Defending the Trump administration's handling of the US economy, Vice-President Pence said: ""Right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs"". Thatâs roughly correct, although the unemployment rate is still significantly higher than it was prior to the pandemic. From March to April this year, more than 22.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Since then, around 11.4 million jobs have been added. The unemployment rate is currently 7.9%. It was 3.5% in February this year, before the coronavirus outbreak hit in the US. Â© 2025 BBC.
