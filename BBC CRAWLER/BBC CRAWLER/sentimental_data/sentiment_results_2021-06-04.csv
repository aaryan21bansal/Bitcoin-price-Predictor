"Pupils have lost months of school time due to Covid Pupils fell behind again in the second lockdown, losing progress in maths and reading from the autumn term. New research for the government also reveals large regional differences across England in learning loss. It follows the resignation of Sir Kevan Collins, education recovery commissioner for England, whose plans for helping pupils catch up were rejected by ministers as too expensive. The government has invested Â£3.1bn and more money may follow in the autumn. On 4 January, schools in England opened briefly and then closed for a second national lockdown, leaving most pupils learning remotely at home. This research for the government by the Education Policy Institute shows that by March 2021, primary pupils were almost as far behind as after the first lockdown and summer holidays last year. In maths, that meant primary pupils were on average 3.5 months behind where children have been in previous non-pandemic years. For reading, the learning loss by the end of the spring term was an average of 2.2 months for primary pupils. The analysis shows schools helped pupils make progress during the autumn, but much of that was wiped out when they closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children. And some parts of the North East and East Midlands were among the areas worst affected. At the beginning of the autumn term, researchers were able to capture how far behind primary pupils were in maths and reading compared with previous years. PM vows more school catch-up cash in funding row Lockdown left poor pupils further behind in maths Â£13.5bn needed for pupils to catch up, report says This reveals in the South West, pupils in primary school were 1.5 months behind in reading, and two months in maths. But in Yorkshire and Humber, the difference was 2.6 months in reading, and 5.8 months in maths. As the national picture shows that any progress made later in the autumn was lost in early 2021, the regional  differences may remain. The research also confirmed that the poorest pupils had lost more learning than average. Jon Andrews, report co-author and head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute (EPI) said: ""Our data analysis points to a clear penalty faced by disadvantaged pupils during the pandemic - these pupils have seen greater learning losses than their more affluent peers, which risks widening the overall gap in educational attainment."" The research has been published just days after the resignation of Sir Kevan who described government plans to help pupils catch up as ""half-hearted"". He said the government response was ""too narrow"" and was being delivered ""too slowly"". He was reported as having put forward plans costing Â£15bn. Head teachers said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by the  government 's latest  Â£1.4bn Covid recovery package, calling it a ""damp squib"". It followed an existing commitment to spend Â£1.7bn in England's schools. The prime minister said there would ""hopefully"" be more money to come in the autumn, as part of the government's wider spending plans. But the influential economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is warning that delaying decisions until the autumn risks being too late to help the pupils most in need of support. ""If these losses are not properly addressed, then the long-run costs could easily run into the hundreds of billions as a result of lost skills and productivity,"" the IFS says. The IFS researchers point out that the recovery package is smaller than in other countries. The IFS says Â£15bn sounds like a lot of money to spend on education recovery, but spread over three years, it would have averaged about Â£5bn per year, or just over 10% of annual spending on schools pre-Covid. ""If it genuinely helped to mitigate the future lost earnings of today's schoolchildren (which could easily run into the hundreds of billions over the coming decades), it could also prove to be a terrific investment,"" it said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""This research provides further stark evidence of the very severe extent of learning loss among pupils as a result of the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the particularly severe impact on disadvantaged children. ""It is abundantly clear that a recovery programme is urgently required at a scale and scope to address this massive issue."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We have committed to an ambitious, and long-term education recovery plan, including an investment to date of over Â£3bn and a significant expansion of our tutoring programme, to support children and young people to make up for learning lost during the pandemic.""

"This video can not be played G7: 'I believe we can make significant progress' - Sunak A global agreement to end the ""race to the bottom"" on corporate taxation is within sight, according to the French and German finance ministers. France's Bruno le Maire told the BBC the G7 club of rich nations were ""just one millimetre away from a historic agreement"" on a global minimum rate. He urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. The German finance minister said a 15% rate would help pay back Covid debt Tax on big tech and multi-nationals has been a source of friction between the US and fellow G7 countries such as the UK. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said it was important to stop the world's biggest companies from dodging tax. He said it was ""absolutely necessary"" to reach a deal in order to ""get out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes todayâ¦especially after the Covid crisis and all the money we spent to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy."" French finance minister Bruno le Maire told the BBC any deal must include both a tech tax on digital activities as well as a minimum rate Mr Le Maire also urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get ""on board"". He added: ""European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough"". Both ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point. Mr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a ""starting point"". He said: ""If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%."" However, Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a ""turning point"" after years of going in the other direction. It came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he was ""confident"" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders. Finance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two day meeting which starts in London on Friday. Ahead of the G7 talks, starting in London on Friday, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system ""fit for the 21st Century"". In a letter to The Guardian,external, they wrote: ""Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it."" Those attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its ""historic nature"". Mr Scholz told me they'll ""have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation"". Another finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. The UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it. There are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording ""at least 15%"" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. The US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a ""non-starter"", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. The end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. This could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals. On Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms. However, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July. US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Mr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting. Speaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: ""Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners. ""I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend."" Governments have become increasingly concerned about the amount of tax paid by US tech giants. The ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues. The meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year,according to The Guardian,external. Microsoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP. Microsoft said this was  due to ""a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain"". ""Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" a spokesperson added. All G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world. Germany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is ""a promising start"" but said G7 nations must reach ""a common position on a new international tax system"" in London before more nations meet next month. They wrote,external: ""We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens."" The UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms. It is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook. The Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a ""floor"". Finance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

"Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restriction levels, allowing them to meet in larger groups indoors and outside. In Glasgow people are allowed to meet in each other's homes for the first time in nine months, and to drink alcohol in pub and restaurants. Other areas of the mainland are seeing soft play centres open for the first time in more than a year. But restrictions on many of Scotland's islands are nearest ""normality"". Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles have moved into level zero - the lowest of the Scottish government's five tier system for exiting lockdown. Fourteen council areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland moved from level two to level one at midnight. What level is your area in? What are the latest Covid rules? However 13 areas with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt remain in level two, rather than moving down to level one as planned due to high case numbers. The whole country is due to move to level zero on 28 June but the prevalence of the Delta variant, first detected in India, may delay that. Infections have more than tripled in the past month with Friday's 992 new cases being thehighest figure reported since 17 February. There were 860 new cases reported on Saturday. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said public health advisors were ""little bit worried"" and the country had to be ""cautious"" in its route out of lockdown. Danny Whelan and Fiona Griffin were among the first to enjoy a drink indoors at FlÃ¹r in Glasgow's Partick In Glasgow, where residents and businesses have faced the toughest restrictions in Scotland for almost nine months, pubs and restaurants are opening later in the evenings and serving alcohol indoors again. Steve Aitken of FlÃ¹r in Partick told BBC Scotland of his relief at being able to finally allow customers to drink alcohol inside. ""There's been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of times when we've felt like chucking it but now we've finally got the doors open, we've got some people inside, it's going to be amazing,"" he said. The city that has been locked down for nine months The bar operated as a takeaway/bottle shop during lockdown but now he is hopeful for the future. ""Probably the biggest worry is another spike and another lockdown but hopefully with the vaccine and everyone playing the game, we won't have that,"" he added. Customer Danny Whelen said: ""It feels like a lifetime ago the last time we could be indoors and enjoying drinks. I'm delighted - happy to be back."" For some children it was their first time at soft play in Inverclyde Bob McVitie, of Inverclyde Leisure, said it was great to welcome back staff and customers to soft play for the first time in 440 days after the region moved to level one. ""I think it all gives us a little bit of hope that lockdown's easing and there's a bright future ahead,"" he said. Customer Monica Miller said it was the first time her young son, Blair, had been to the facility. ""It's wonderful experience... a small bit of normality back into life for us, to let him be among other kids, run about and have a bit of freedom."" Scotland's councils will be in thefollowing levelsfrom Saturday: Level two- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, and Stirling Level one- Highland, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East Lothian, West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and the Borders Level zero- Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, and a number of smaller islands Meanwhile in Orkney the move to level zero means up to 10 people from four households can meet in a cafe, pub or restaurant. Raymond Hutchison, from the St Ola Hotel in Kirkwall, said it was a welcome boost to businesses on the islands. He told BBC Scotland: ""What's more exciting for me is that we've got into level zero now at the start of June. ""So does that mean we can get to the next level, which is what we need, as early as the end of the month? That would be fantastic."" Raymond Hutchison said the further easing of restrictions at the beginning of the summer was good timing for businesses in Orkney But the leader of Orkney Islands Council, James Stockan, also urged caution as increasing numbers of tourists visit the islands over the summer. ""It's the direction of travel that's really important. At the same time we've got to be very conscious that we have more and more people coming here,"" he told the BBC. ""We're really asking them to take a lateral flow test - and even our own community going away and coming back again. Just taking those tests to give us an extra degree of safety."" Outside the central belt most of the mainland now faces level one restrictions. The change to personal freedoms which comes from a move down from level two is not dramatic, but it does change the mood. The knowledge that it is possible to meet more friends and family members can lift spirits. In Campbeltown this morning, for instance, the atmosphere seems much more relaxed almost - for want of a better phrase - normal. Customers in shops still have to wear masks, of course, while cafes still have to take details from diners. But mainland Argyll and Bute now has lighter restrictions than at any time since March 2020. In much of rural Scotland tourism is hugely important to the economy and the stakes will be high for many businesses. But in some rural areas there is a little nervousness too. Often these areas have had very low Covid rates all through the crisis. Some local people may be worried that reopening travel risks a rise in case numbers - despite optimism that vaccination is breaking the link between cases and serious illnesses. That perhaps serves as a reminder to visitors to follow the rules and be mindful that some local people, who may seem like they are being over-vigilant, might be a little worried. After so long, finding a form of normal is about more than the legal easing of restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

"A digital model of the new Overture aircraft in United livery US airline United has announced plans to buy 15 new supersonic airliners and ""return supersonic speeds to aviation"" in the year 2029. Supersonic passenger flights ended in 2003 when Air France and British Airways retired Concorde. The new Overture aircraft will be produced by a Denver-based company called Boom, which has yet to flight-test a supersonic jet. United's deal is conditional on the new aircraft meeting safety standards. Supersonic flight is when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound. At an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300m), that means flying faster than 660mph (1,060km/h). A typical passenger jet may cruise at about 560mph (900km/h) but Overture is expected to reach speeds of 1,122mph (1,805km/h) - also known as Mach 1.7. Concorde was retired in 2003 At that speed, journey times on transatlantic routes such as London to New York can be cut in half. Boom says Overture would be able to make the trip in 3.5 hours, shaving three hours off the flight. Concorde, which entered passenger service in 1976, was even faster with a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 - about 1,350mph (2180km/h). There are two major concerns with supersonic passenger travel: noise and pollution. Travelling faster than the speed of sound causes a sonic boom, which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap or explosion. It's where the company Boom got its name. The boom limits where the planes can fly. Typically they must lower their speed until they are out over the ocean, away from citizens who may be disturbed by the loud bang. Boom says it is confident that its plane will not be any louder than other modern passenger jets while taking off, flying over land and landing. It also hopes improvements in aircraft design since Concorde will help it reduce and mitigate the sonic boom. The other big issue is fuel consumption. ""In order to fly supersonic, you will need more power, you will need more fuel,"" Kathy Savitt, Boom's chief commercial officer, told the BBC. But she expects Overture to be operated as a ""net-zero carbon aircraft"". Central to Boom's plan is for Overture to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (Saf). That can take the form of ""posh biodiesel"" made out of everything from waste animal fat from the farming industry to specially grown high-energy crops, explains Dr Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University. But one big problem is that ""the world is very far from having anything like the production capacity needed"" to produce enough biofuel to power the entire aviation industry, he says. Boom predicts ""power-to-liquid"" processes - where renewable energy such as wind power is used to produce liquid fuel - will make up the shortfall. ""We expect that to be commercialised well before it's needed for our purposes,"" explains Boom's Raymond Russell. ""There are billions of dollars of both airline commitments and investments across the sector."" But it remains an industry that needs to be scaled up. A digital model of the new Overture aircraft in United livery ""Can you suddenly find an enormous additional supply of sustainable electricity at affordable prices?"" asks Dr Gratton. ""I'm not saying it can't be done. It may well be done but it has not been done yet."" Despite the enormous cost of Concorde's development more than 50 years ago, it is thought to have been profitable for British Airways in its final years of operation. Concorde was seen as a luxurious way to travel with tickets costing more than a first class seat on a regular jet. Today, the wealthiest travellers may favour private business jets, says Dr Gratton. Rather than travel first class on a commercial jet with the public, the rich can charter compact private planes that fly on demand, directly to-and-from their airports of choice. Avoiding the check-in desk and luggage carousel can shave time off travelling too. Ms Savitt said Boom's research suggested passengers wanted speed and that faster planes could ""deepen human connections and make better business relationships"". Unlike Concorde, the company expects Overture to be profitable for airlines even if tickets are sold for the same price as a ""regular business-class fare"". Ultimately, it is up to United to set its prices - but it will want to see a return on its $200m-per-plane (Â£140m) investment.

"This video can not be played Nepalese prime minister calls on UK to provide Covid vaccines Nepal's prime minister has made an urgent plea for vaccines to his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, as the Himalayan nation experiences a devastating second wave of coronavirus. Speaking to the BBC, KP Sharma Oli said it was Britain's responsibility given the historic ties the nations share. Mr Oli said the sacrifices of Nepal's Gurkha soldiers serving the UK should make Nepal a priority for UK Covid aid. Nepal reported a high of 9,000 daily infections last month. ""I want to convince the UK Government, particularly Prime Minister Boris Johnson, about the situation in Nepal and how we are suffering,"" Mr Oli said. Nepal, which has one of the highest rates of positive tests in the world, saw a surge of cases in May, recording more than 4,000 deaths over the course of the month. Like its neighbour India, Nepal has struggled with shortages of beds and oxygen supplies. The situation has eased recently in places like the capital Kathmandu, but the virus is now spreading in rural areas. This video can not be played Relatives in Nepal have been forced to say goodbye through crematorium gates At the start of February, Nepal was reporting around 100 daily cases, but by early May that figure had jumped to as many as 9,000 daily infections. A national lockdown which began in April remains in place but many say it came too late. The country's borders with India remain open. Critics say that failing to close them allowed the Delta variant detected in India to spread quickly into Nepal as migrant workers returned home. The Himalayan country has received some international aid, including 260 ventilators and 2,000 PPE kits from the UK. But Mr Oli said it was vaccines he needed. Fewer than 3% of Nepal's population of 30 million has been fully vaccinated. Short on vaccines, Nepal faces looming Covid crisis India's neighbours are battling new Covid wave ""If we vaccinate people, then we can control Covid-19, otherwise it will be hard for us,"" Mr Oli said. Nepalese authorities have ordered supplies from China, but many elderly Nepalis who received their first dose of the Astrazeneca jab are now unable to get their second, after supplies promised from India were delayed because of the crisis there. Prime Minister Oli said he was making the direct appeal to the UK, as Nepal's ""oldest friend"". ""The Gurkhas have served the UK for many years, keeping their lives at risk,"" he said. ""People who are serving in Britain have their families in Nepal. So that is a very deep connection."" A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office told the BBC it ""stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Nepal during this pandemic"" and was ""one of the first countries to send health experts and life-saving medical equipment to Nepal"". ""The UK is a leading donor to COVAX, the international initiative to procure and distribute vaccines equitably,"" the spokesperson added. ""We have committed Â£548 million to the scheme that will provide more than a billion vaccines to developing countries, including Nepal, this year."" Nepal recorded 4,000 coronavirus deaths in May as case numbers surges Mr Oli said his country's foreign minister had spoken to UK counterpart Dominic Raab to discuss the issue, but he was trying to establish direct telephone contact with Mr Johnson. The appeal to the UK comes as the US has announced it will send vaccines to Nepal as part of a donation of 7 million doses to Asia. Mr Oli has faced criticism of his handling of the pandemic and for failing to take the virus seriously. He previously claimed that it could be washed away by gargling guava leaves and turmeric, and said Nepali's have stronger immune systems because of their diets. Last month, as case numbers were rising sharply, he said the situation in Nepal was ""under control"". Prime Minister Oli, who remains in power after a recent vote of no confidence, also drew criticism for holding mass political rallies earlier this year as MPs in his own party withdrew support for him.

"The UK's election watchdog has admitted it previously incorrectly registered donations to the Conservative Party. The Electoral Commission had reported that the party accepted Â£10,000 in November 2019 from a company dissolved three years prior. But the watchdog has now said this was an ""administrative error,"" adding the party had in fact reported a donation from a different firm. It added it regretted ""any confusion,"" and the record would be corrected. Additionally, the commission said the Conservatives had advised them the party had ""inaccurately reported"" donations from another company. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""We welcome this decision from the Electoral Commission and we will continue to work with them."" Earlier this week Labour called for the watchdog to investigate whether the donations had breached electoral transparency laws. Probe urged into Tory donations from defunct firms What are the rules governing political donations? Under current legislation, parties may only accept donations from a UK-registered company if it ""carries on business in the United Kingdom"". In its regular reporting of political donations, the commission said the Tories had accepted Â£10,000 from Stridewell Estates in November 2019. Government records indicate that the firm had been dissolved three years earlier, in November 2016. The commission said the party had in fact reported a donation from another firm, called Kirklee Property Company 2 Limited, and it had incorrectly confused the two because they shared the same address. Official records show that company was set up in 2006 and is still active. Business Insider, which first reported the story, has previously quoted a spokesman for Stridewell suggesting it could be a mistake. Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds wrote to the commission earlier this week The watchdog added that it was still working with the party to establish the details of donations from another company, Unionist Buildings Limited. The commission has reported that the Tories accepted Â£6,000 from the firm in June 2017. Records show the firm was dissolved six months earlier, in January. The commission said the Conservatives had admitted incorrectly reporting donations from that firm - but gave no further details. It said it remained in contact with the party ""so that we can publish the correct information and provide transparency to voters"". Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: ""This confirmation that the Conservatives inaccurately recorded a donation amounting to thousands of pounds raises more questions than it answers. We urgently need to know where that money came from."" Meanwhile, the commission has also admitted it incorrectly registered details of another donation to the Conservatives in late 2019. It had previously said the party got Â£3,250 in December 2019 from a company called Landcap Development Eversley Ltd, which was disbanded 12 months prior. But it said the party had in fact reported a donation from a still-active company, Landcap Limited. It again said it had confused the two businesses because they shared an address. It is understood the watchdog discovered that error after the registered donation was brought to its attention.

"British fishermen are eager to gain access to Norwegian waters The UK has signed a post-Brexit trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the government has announced. The agreement will be a major boost for trade between the four non-EU nations, which is already worth Â£21.6bn, UK minister Liz Truss said. She claimed it would boost sectors such as digital and cut tariffs on UK farm products such as cheese and meat. Britain is Norway's top trading partner outside the European Union (EU). The UK government said reduced import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock would cut costs for UK fish processing, helping to support jobs in Scotland, East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire. As Britain is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy, it must deal directly with Norway andUK fleets are keen to have access to the country's sub-Arctic seas. However, many Norwegian farmers have expressed concerns at opening up the domestic market to British beef and cheese. State broadcaster NRK says the country's market of 5.4 million people is small but potentially lucrative, with strong purchasing power. The countries involved are the three non-EU members of the European Economic Area, which allows them to be part of the EU's single market. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said ""the deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries"". However, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA. In terms of their overall trade volumes, this deal is more significant for Norway and Iceland than it is for the UK. But politically, it's really important for the post-Brexit British government to show that new trade deals are being done quickly. Even if - as the Norwegian side points out - it is less open than the previous relationship inside the same single market. The new deal builds on the rollover agreement the UK signed before it left the EU's economic zone, and the government is keen to stress it includes important elements on digital trade which go beyond what the EU has. But digital and data provisions are relatively new elements in free trade agreements, and it's still unclear how effective they are in the long term. ""At first sight, the deal looks cautiously ambitious,"" says trade expert David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. ""In many fields, from climate change to SMEs [small businesses] to digital, it sets out some goals, without it being obvious that the underlying provisions will deliver them."" So, it's a decent start. But it's the implementation that counts. ""Prior to the UK's exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,"" Norway said. ""A free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market."" The UK's international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said the deal would be ""a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth Â£21.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home"". Iceland's Foreign Minister, Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, said an agreement with the UK had been a priority for his country and would be ""crucial for both Icelandic companies and consumers"".

"Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restriction levels, allowing them to meet in larger groups indoors and outside. In Glasgow people are allowed to meet in each other's homes for the first time in nine months, and to drink alcohol in pub and restaurants. Other areas of the mainland are seeing soft play centres open for the first time in more than a year. But restrictions on many of Scotland's islands are nearest ""normality"". Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles have moved into level zero - the lowest of the Scottish government's five tier system for exiting lockdown. Fourteen council areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland moved from level two to level one at midnight. What level is your area in? What are the latest Covid rules? However 13 areas with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt remain in level two, rather than moving down to level one as planned due to high case numbers. The whole country is due to move to level zero on 28 June but the prevalence of the Delta variant, first detected in India, may delay that. Infections have more than tripled in the past month with Friday's 992 new cases being thehighest figure reported since 17 February. There were 860 new cases reported on Saturday. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said public health advisors were ""little bit worried"" and the country had to be ""cautious"" in its route out of lockdown. Danny Whelan and Fiona Griffin were among the first to enjoy a drink indoors at FlÃ¹r in Glasgow's Partick In Glasgow, where residents and businesses have faced the toughest restrictions in Scotland for almost nine months, pubs and restaurants are opening later in the evenings and serving alcohol indoors again. Steve Aitken of FlÃ¹r in Partick told BBC Scotland of his relief at being able to finally allow customers to drink alcohol inside. ""There's been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of times when we've felt like chucking it but now we've finally got the doors open, we've got some people inside, it's going to be amazing,"" he said. The city that has been locked down for nine months The bar operated as a takeaway/bottle shop during lockdown but now he is hopeful for the future. ""Probably the biggest worry is another spike and another lockdown but hopefully with the vaccine and everyone playing the game, we won't have that,"" he added. Customer Danny Whelen said: ""It feels like a lifetime ago the last time we could be indoors and enjoying drinks. I'm delighted - happy to be back."" For some children it was their first time at soft play in Inverclyde Bob McVitie, of Inverclyde Leisure, said it was great to welcome back staff and customers to soft play for the first time in 440 days after the region moved to level one. ""I think it all gives us a little bit of hope that lockdown's easing and there's a bright future ahead,"" he said. Customer Monica Miller said it was the first time her young son, Blair, had been to the facility. ""It's wonderful experience... a small bit of normality back into life for us, to let him be among other kids, run about and have a bit of freedom."" Scotland's councils will be in thefollowing levelsfrom Saturday: Level two- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, and Stirling Level one- Highland, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East Lothian, West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and the Borders Level zero- Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, and a number of smaller islands Meanwhile in Orkney the move to level zero means up to 10 people from four households can meet in a cafe, pub or restaurant. Raymond Hutchison, from the St Ola Hotel in Kirkwall, said it was a welcome boost to businesses on the islands. He told BBC Scotland: ""What's more exciting for me is that we've got into level zero now at the start of June. ""So does that mean we can get to the next level, which is what we need, as early as the end of the month? That would be fantastic."" Raymond Hutchison said the further easing of restrictions at the beginning of the summer was good timing for businesses in Orkney But the leader of Orkney Islands Council, James Stockan, also urged caution as increasing numbers of tourists visit the islands over the summer. ""It's the direction of travel that's really important. At the same time we've got to be very conscious that we have more and more people coming here,"" he told the BBC. ""We're really asking them to take a lateral flow test - and even our own community going away and coming back again. Just taking those tests to give us an extra degree of safety."" Outside the central belt most of the mainland now faces level one restrictions. The change to personal freedoms which comes from a move down from level two is not dramatic, but it does change the mood. The knowledge that it is possible to meet more friends and family members can lift spirits. In Campbeltown this morning, for instance, the atmosphere seems much more relaxed almost - for want of a better phrase - normal. Customers in shops still have to wear masks, of course, while cafes still have to take details from diners. But mainland Argyll and Bute now has lighter restrictions than at any time since March 2020. In much of rural Scotland tourism is hugely important to the economy and the stakes will be high for many businesses. But in some rural areas there is a little nervousness too. Often these areas have had very low Covid rates all through the crisis. Some local people may be worried that reopening travel risks a rise in case numbers - despite optimism that vaccination is breaking the link between cases and serious illnesses. That perhaps serves as a reminder to visitors to follow the rules and be mindful that some local people, who may seem like they are being over-vigilant, might be a little worried. After so long, finding a form of normal is about more than the legal easing of restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

"This video can not be played Covid: Social distancing to stay as 'personal repertoire' Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said it remained one of the ""strongest defences"" against Covid. The warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing. Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. But, Mr Drakeford said he was ""not certain there is a huge thirst"" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule. ""I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,"" he told a coronavirus press briefing. ""Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" Allowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased. The decision to delay comes amid ""growing concern"" overthe Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated. There are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? Welsh government signals return of sports fans Mr Drakeford said: ""The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle. ""This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults."" However, he added: ""We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales. ""That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant."" The lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June. The changes - described as a phased move toWales' alert level one,external- will begin from Monday. It means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time. A further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households. Further rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when anending to restrictions in Englandmay happen. Call for pub rules to be lifted Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Pubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has calledfor all significant restrictions to be liftedbefore July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule. WeMakeEvents organised protests and campaigns to help support the arts Sarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was ""great news"" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns. In recent weeks aseries of test eventshave been held, including the Tafwyl andEid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators. Ms Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's ""cautious"" approach, the test events had been ""incredibly restrictive"" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing. She added: ""The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it. ""But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work."" Up to 4,000 standing can attend outdoor events in Wales from 7 June Annual events, such as Brecon Jazz andGreen Man Festival, were waiting to seeif they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September. ""There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,"" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. ""It's great to have live music back."" The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""There's Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that."" Plaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while ""the economic devastation of the pandemic remains."" Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the ""cautious"" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were ""exhausted"". She also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits. Despite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to thatdemanded last year. ""I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe."" Wales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%. Figures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales. The case rate in Walesis currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days. A cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible fora spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23.

"Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday. British Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes. The move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days. But travel firm Tui says50% of passengers due to travel there in Juneare still planning to go. Any travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than Â£540. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" he said. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" Speaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that ""tough"" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Covid infections rise by two-thirds in UK - ONS Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' However, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the ""logic"" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. He also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: ""I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers."" It comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2. The latest figures show,externala further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported. No new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June. Labour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or ""at the very least"" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant. The travel industryhas criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces ""another lost summer"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not ""based on any science or public health"", and that  he did not understand why the UK ""which has been so successful with vaccines"" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Ryanair boss criticises 'unnecessary disruption' over Portugal travel Alan Richards, centre, and his family say it is impossible for them to return home in time Alan Richards travelled to the Algarve on Saturday with seven of his family, including grandchildren, and they were due to return home on Tuesday. Now he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school. ""We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,"" he says. But with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal. The extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost Â£120 each, he says, adding Â£960 to the family's holiday bill. A week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says. ""No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,"" he says. ""Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign."" Portugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said. Some 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures. Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? 'Let us go on holiday and live our lives' Public Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. The number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks. On 2 June,Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. PHEbelieves the Delta variant is now dominant in the UKand that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. Earlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be ""60% more transmissible"" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha. Asked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing ""towards the direction of being cautious"".

"Outdoor wedding receptions can have more guests than indoor venues Planning a wedding has been a frustrating process for many since the first Covid lockdown in March last year. Rules on outdoor wedding receptionsnow allow guest numbers to match concerts and sporting events. But some in the wedding industry have branded the changes ""confusing"", while entertainers have been ""forgotten"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said numbers would be based on how many people can be safely accommodated. Under new guidelines from Monday, there will be no limit on numbers at indoor weddings, but the figure has to be calculated following a risk assessment by venue staff. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Wales at start of third Covid wave, warns Drakeford Crowds return to outdoor gigs and sport in Wales Thirty people had previously been able to attend indoor wedding receptions. Mr Drakeford said that rule had now been relaxed: ""At quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now."" Other restrictions will remain however. Guests have to follow social distancing rules, including wearing face masks at indoor venues when not eating or drinking while seated. The bride and groom do not have to wear masks when walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, or for their first kiss and first dance. They are also able to remove them for indoor photographs just of themselves, but photos should be done outdoors where possible. Only the bride and groom are allowed to take part in a first dance, and no other dancing is permitted. Background music can be played at a low volume during the ceremony and the reception, but no singing or chanting is allowed. Speeches can be made, but guidance issued states that microphones should not be shared and gifts should not be given out during speeches. Stephanie Hobrow and Matt Tomkins are on their third wedding date Stephanie Hobrow, 38, from Cowbridge in Vale of Glamorgan, has set a date for her wedding to fiancÃ© Matt Tomkins three times in the past year. She also works with wedding venues as a marketing manager. She said the Welsh government's update on wedding restrictions was ""slightly confusing again"". ""Wedding receptions that are outdoors have now been included in the numbers of 4,000 and 10,000 capacity. So, in theory, from Monday you can get married or have your wedding reception outside with unlimited amounts of guests. ""At the moment, work-wise, it's just a case of dealing with each bride and groom on a case-by-case basis, depending what they want to do. We've got some venues that have outside space, some that have only got inside space. ""Personally, I'm just sitting it out and waiting really. There's not a lot I can do now. We should have been last September, we then moved to April and now moved it to September. ""Dress is done, venue is done, flowers are done, band is done... it's just the evening part that's the uncertain bit at the moment. ""If there's the option to have possibly unlimited numbers now for a reception that's outside, I think people would be crazy to not explore that avenue."" DJ Matt Lane's last booking for a wedding was in March 2020 Wedding DJ Matt Lane from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, said: ""When the first lockdown started, all my brides and grooms postponed, most of them for either later on in the year or 2021. ""But the further we get into this year, they're all postponing again and it just keeps getting pushed back. My last wedding was March 2020. I haven't done a wedding since, people don't want to go ahead with it because they can't have the numbers they want. ""At the momentyou can only have background music, the bride and groom can get up for the first dance, then after that everyone else has to sit back down,external, so everything's moving to 2022 now. ""How long before people decide they're not going to do it and cancel altogether?"" He added that the entertainment industry had been ""forgotten about"", while pubs and restaurants reopened. ""I've been able to get some of the grants available, but it's nothing compared to what I've lost - I've lost thousands, I'd usually do around 30 weddings a year,"" he said. ""As a wedding supplier we're basically forced to shut down. There should have been more help for entertainers."" Paul Rees and Yvonne Inglis Paul Rees and Yvonne Inglis from Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, had excitedly booked a secret wedding venue for 9 July, to be followed by a big party with their loved ones and a luxury honeymoon abroad. But after Covid ""rolled on and on"" and they both experienced health scares, they have scaled back their plans to have a ""registry office job"" in four weeks' time. And they couldn't be happier. ""I think what happened was Covid actually brought it home, we both had health issues and we sat down and said why don't we just do it?"" said Mr Rees. ""So we've decided on the registry office and then we're having a very small reception, just with our children. The restaurant is where next year's big party will be. ""For our plan B honeymoon - we had booked this fabulous all-inclusive in Turkey - we're doing three days in Windermere at this spa hotel right on the shores of Windermere and then we're going up to Edinburgh the rest of the week, where Yvonne is from, and it gives us the opportunity to see her family. ""Out of disaster we've kind of rescued it, so we're really excited. We had to look at it very pragmatically. Given that we'd both been ill we decided we are going to get married come what may. ""Both Yvonne and I had Covid just before Christmas. I was significantly worse than Yvonne, but we were both really really ill. At the same time, she had an issue where she was getting pains down one side and the first thing she thought was a heart issue. We had that investigated and it was nothing. ""I'm 63, Yvonne is 55. At our time of life, we'd both had health scares, there's nothing to say that won't happen again, so why don't we just get married?"" Mr Drakeford said he could ""understand and sympathise"" with those planning a wedding about the continued limitations on indoor gatherings, but his decision was based on the science, which suggested the chances of catching coronavirus indoors was 15 to 20 times higher than in outdoor settings. ""The distinction that we have made all the way through with outdoors being better than indoors has now been confirmed from data from around the world,"" he told the coronavirus briefing on Friday. He added that outdoor wedding receptions would be subjected to the same restrictions as other outdoor events and restrictions on numbers in indoor settings would be reviewed in the coming weeks.

"The crush happened at the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground Two police forces are to pay damages to more than 600 people over a cover-up which followed the Hillsborough disaster. The South Yorkshire and West Midlands forces agreed the settlement earlier this year following a civil claim. Nobody has ever been convicted over police actions following the disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans died in a crush at a 1989 FA Cup semi-final. South Yorkshire Police offered an ""unreserved apology"" to those affected. Acting Chief Constable Lauren Poultney said the force acknowledged that ""serious errors and mistakes were made"" by its officers ""both on 15 April 1989 and during the subsequent investigations"". ""Those actions on the day of the disaster tragically led to lives being lost and many being injured [while] the force's subsequent failings also caused huge distress, suffering and pain, both to the victims and their families,"" she added. Details of the claim were revealed after former Ch Supt Donald Denton, 83, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster, 74, and Peter Metcalf, 71, who acted as a solicitor for the force,were acquitted of perverting the course of justicein May. The men were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on the force in the aftermath of the disaster by amending police statements. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the disaster on 15 April 1989 A spokesman for Saunders Law, the lead solicitors for the group litigation, said the civil claim for misfeasance in a public office was started in 2015. It was agreed in April but could not be reported until the conclusion of the trial. While compensation for the 96 victims will go to their bereaved families, damages will also be paid to survivors for the injuries they have suffered and access to a fund for further psychiatric treatment or counselling. The exact amount of compensation has yet to be agreed. Why the Hillsborough prosecutions collapsed Hillsborough: Remembering the 96 victims Timeline of the Hillsborough stadium disaster ""The settlement of these claims marks the end of an unparalleled and extraordinary fight for justice by the victims and their families,"" the Saunders spokesman said. ""We trust that this settlement will put an end to any fresh attempts to rewrite the record and wrongly claim that there was no cover-up."" He said there had been ""an almost complete failure of the justice system to deliver justice"" and called on the governmentto implement a Hillsborough Law,which would include a duty of candour for public officials. The criminal trial of two police officers and a solicitor collapsed because of a fundamental and very unusual legal barrier to it continuing - but claims for damages in civil law work differently. The families had to show on a balance of probabilities that there had been a cover-up - and the evidence was massively in their favour. In 2012 the Independent Panel detailed how the fans were unjustly blamed. The then-South Yorkshire Police chief constable accepted its findings - and then Prime Minister David Camerontold MPs the families had been right all along.,external In short, there was no point in police chiefs fighting a case that would, in all certainty, result in a damning verdict that their institutions had acted improperly. Attention now turns to Parliament. Families want the law to compel public bodies to tell the whole truth in all circumstances. They want guarantees of proper funding so they, like agencies of the state, can have the best lawyers in the land fighting their corner. The proposed Hillsborough Law had cross-party backing until the 2017 General Election stopped it. This government has the choice whether to bring it back. Louise Brookes, who was 17 when her brother Andrew died in the disaster, described the situation as ""shameful"". ""Why they couldn't have just admitted everything 32 years ago and we could have all moved on with our lives,"" she said. ""I have sacrificed 32 years of my life. We've done absolutely nothing wrong. ""How they could put us and the survivors through 32 years of hell?"" Louise Brookes was 17 when her brother Andrew died in the disaster The disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, which was later investigated by West Midlands Police, remains the UK's worst sporting disaster. Many families and survivors have since led a campaign for more than 30 years to discover how and why the victims died. In 2012, then-chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton apologised for a cover-up following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. New inquests, which concluded in 2016, found thatthe men, women and children who died were unlawfully killedand fans played no part in the causes of the disaster. Hillsborough campaigner Prof Phil Scraton said: ""You hear outside of Liverpool people saying 'why are they still going on about it?' ""And to put it into context, 96 men, women and children died at a football match and this has been the most costly, the longest and most complex legal process in British history. ""There's never been anything like it before."" Flowers and tributes were left at the Hillsborough Memorial after the collapse of the recent trial Acting Chief Constable Poultney has since offered ""an unreserved apology to those affected by the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath"" and said the actions of officers on the day of the disaster and afterwards was ""something South Yorkshire Police profoundly regrets"". West Midlands Police Deputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine added: ""We deeply regret the harm and distress caused to those affected by the tragedy. ""Although I know it cannot make up for their suffering, working with South Yorkshire Police we have agreed a scheme to compensate those affected."" She said she would like to thank the families ""for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves"".

"Ghana is one of a number of countries where vaccine doses could run out in the next few weeks There are fresh calls for the UK to show ""historic leadership"" and start sharing its vaccine doses with the world right now. The country is hosting this year's G7 summit, where seven of the world's most powerful countries will come together in Cornwall next week. The Covid pandemic will be high on the agenda. In an open letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the heads of the Wellcome Trust and Unicef in the UK are warning that hard earned freedoms in the country will be ""short lived"",externalif enough people in other countries are not vaccinated too. The letter says decisions at the summit ""will define the 21st Century"", and calls on Mr Johnson and other G7 leaders to ""rise to this challenge and end this crisis for good"". The UK says it has no surplus supplies to share at the moment, but will donate doses when it does. But Unicef says the UK and the other G7 countries could share 20% of their supplies in the next three months without impacting their own domestic rollouts. World on brink of catastrophic moral failure - WHO EU approves Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds Iâm under 30 - which vaccine will I get? Ever since India stopped exporting Covid vaccines because of the crisis there, countries in Africa have been counting down their last doses. ""It is deeply unfair,"" says Dr Phionah Atuhebwe, who is in charge of new vaccine introductions for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Africa. ""Of the almost two billion doses that have been administered globally, sub-Saharan Africa has received about 1% of all these vaccines."" She says 18 African countries have either already run out of doses or are about to, including: Completely run out: Morocco Rwanda eSwatini Will run out in next few weeks: Kenya Ghana Malawi It's a massive blow to many low and middle income countries. In Ghana, there's been a very successful rollout of the first dose of vaccines for the most at risk groups, including health workers. Their second doses are now due - but officials are unclear on when they will arrive. Meanwhile, richer countries have bought up the lion's share of global supplies and are pushing full steam ahead with their vaccination programmes, now administering doses to much lower-risk groups including teenagers. The UK, US and Canada have vaccinated more than half of their populations, while in Germany, Italy and France the numbers are over 30%. Japan's uptake has been much slower, but not because they're short on supplies. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Whereas some countries in Africa have yet to vaccinate a single person, including health workers looking after Covid patients on the front line. The international vaccine equality scheme Covax, which is providing vaccines to some of the world's poorest countries, is currently 190 million doses short. In the open letter, Wellcome's Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar and Unicef UK's Steven Waugh said that because high income countries - including the UK and G7 - have most of the world's Covid vaccine supplies, they ""are the only ones who can makes doses available right now"". Wellcome and Unicef UK are calling for G7 countries to donate 20% of their doses in June, July and August to help plug the massive gap. For the month of June that works out as: US - 26.9 million doses UK - 4.1 million doses Germany - 3.3 million doses France - 2.7 million doses Italy - 2.4 million doses Japan - 2.3 million doses SOURCE: Airfinity/ Unicef ""If we do not getâ¦ doses, we get back to the virus circulating and possibly mutating yet again, coming up with new variants that affect the world and take us all back to square zero,"" says Dr Atuhebwe. So far France and New Zealand are the only nations to have already started diverting some of their own supplies to poorer countries. Boris Johnson promised to donate the UK's surplus dosesthree months ago. In the open letter, the authors called on the prime minister to ""make that pledge a reality"". But speaking at the G7 health ministers meeting in Oxford this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were no plans to do that, yet. ""The UK vaccination programme has very much been based on delivering vaccines as soon as they're delivered to us,"" he said. ""So we don't have excess doses at the moment. But absolutely we want to lean in to this global effort, when there is spare capacity."" In the latest round of pledges this week, countries have promised another $2.4bn (Â£1.7bn) to the Covax scheme to help get vaccines into poorer countries. But with manufacturing unable to keep up with demand, and a few rich countries hoarding current supplies - it's the world's poorest who remain last in line. That in turn could mean deadlier versions of a mutated version of Covid-19 ending up back on the shores of wealthier nations.

"Edwin Poots was ratified as the new leader of the DUP last week Edwin Poots has defended his strategy as the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) new leader after criticism by one of his predecessors, Peter Robinson. Writing in the News Letter,external, the ex-leader and former first minister said decisions being made by those advising Mr Poots ""can only damage his prospects of moving the party forward"". Mr Poots rejected that comment, saying Mr Robinson was ""out of the loop"". ""What was good for Peter doesn't seem to be good for anybody else,"" he said. Insisting his leadership would differ from that of Arlene Foster, who he has replaced at the helm of the party, Mr Poots said: ""What you're going to see is incremental change. ""Step by step we will ensure that the fortunes of the party are better and the fortunes of unionism per se are better,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Last week, the DUP endorsed an earlier vote by assembly members and MPs to make Mr Poots leader. But it came amid anger from within the party about how Mrs Foster was ousted last month. Peter Robinson - pictured with Arlene Foster in 2015 - has criticised those within the DUP who brought about her downfall as leader In his News Letter column, Mr Robinson contrasted how Ian Paisley - the DUP's first leader - was removed ""sensitively"" with the ""needlessly nasty"" nature of Mrs Foster's toppling and urged Mr Poots to accept that had been a mistake. ""Politics is a rough trade and of course it must hurt if a political career is ended before the participant's preferred time,"" wrote Mr Robinson. ""But the savage slaying of a leader in the public eye was totally unnecessary and vindictive."" He wrote that it was ""counterproductive"" and had ""caused serious damage to the party and equally inflicted self-harm upon her successor"". ""One has to wonder what kind of strategy those advising Edwin are following when they took - and continue to take - decisions which can only damage his prospects of moving the party forward,"" he added. Who is Edwin Poots, the new DUP leader? Mr Poots responded by saying: ""The problem that Peter has is that he's out of the loop and therefore doesn't know exactly what was going on or what happened. ""The only thing different in how things were done when Peter became leader and when I became leader is that, actually, the people who made things public were people who were not in the Poots camp."" On Thursday Mr Poots said he would lead DUP ministers at this month's North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in Dublin. He had denied boycotting some meetings in protest against the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland,known as the Northern Ireland Procotol. Paul Givan joined Edwin Poots for his meeting with Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin in Dublin on Thursday The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that effectively creates a trade border in Irish Sea, meaning checks apply to goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. After his first meeting as DUP leader with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin, Mr Poots saidthey had ""positive, frank and useful"" talks, mostly about the protocol. Mr Martin said they had shared an ""open exchange of views"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was right that DUP ministers would attend NSMC meetings, saying that was ""where they should be"". ""I think [Mr Poots] was feeling the pressure clearly because it wasn't acceptable for his party to continue in that vein,"" she said on Friday. However, TUV leader Jim Allister criticised Mr Poots' decision and described it as a ""total flip flop"". He said members of the DUP who backed Edwin Poots and thought they were getting ""strong leadership"" are going to be ""very disappointed"". The DUP leader was accompanied at that meeting by close ally and senior DUP MLA Paul Givan. Mr Givan is one of the favourites to be appointed first minister, with Mr Poots having said he will not take on the role and will instead remain agriculture minister. Mr Givan told the BBC's The Nolan Show that he had spoken to Mr Poots about ""the kinds of responsibilities people are prepared to take on"". ""I've made it clear to Edwin that whatever role he wants me to do I've never shied away from taking on that responsibility,"" he said. ""Edwin has not asked me to [become first minister] and I have not asked to do that role. ""That is ultimately a decision for Edwin to take."" The Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party have warned thatpolitical instability could be sparked by ""dithering""over the appointment of a new first minister. Mr Poots also attended a meeting of Stormont party leaders on Thursday at which it was agreed to convene a summit to start dealing with Northern Ireland's hospital waiting lists crisis. Health officials believe it could take 10 years to fully deal with Northern Ireland's waiting lists More than 335,000 peopleare waiting for a first consultant-led appointment, meaning Northern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region. How could NI's health service get more funding? John Compton, a former chief executive of the health service in Northern Ireland, said that solving the crisis was the biggest ever test for Stormont politicians. ""I don't think anybody now disputes that people are having their lives curtailed or dying because of the extent of waiting times,"" he told The Nolan Show. Mr Poots said the lists had grown at a ""shocking rate"" between 2017 and 2020 when the power-sharing administration was not functioning due to disagreements between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, the two biggest parties. ""We do recognise that the waiting lists that have been allowed to develop in Northern Ireland are entirely unreasonable,"" he said. Ms O'Neill said she had asked the UK government for financial help to deal with the waiting lists. Poots will attend next north-south meeting UUP and Alliance warn of political instability Who is Stormont's new Speaker?

"Facebook Inc has suspended former US President Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts for two years. He was barred indefinitely from both sites in January in the wake of posts he made on the US Capitol riots, but last month Facebook's Oversight Board criticised the open-ended penalty. Facebook said Mr Trump's actions were ""a severe violation of our rules"". Mr Trump said the move was ""an insult"" to the millions who voted for him in last year's presidential election. Facebook's move comes as the social media giant is also ending a policy shielding politicians from some content moderation rules. It said that it would no longer give politicians immunity for deceptive or abusive content based on their comments being newsworthy. Mr Trump's ban was effective from the date of the initial suspension on 7 January,Facebook's vice-president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a post,external. ""Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available,"" it added. This video can not be played Facebook's Nick Clegg explains former US President Donald Trump's two year suspension ""If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded."" On his return, Mr Trump will be held to ""a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions,"" for any violations, Mr Clegg's statement noted. In a statement issued from his Save America political action committee, Mr Trump said: ""Facebook's ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75m people, plus many others, who voted for us..."" ""They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our country can't take this abuse anymore!"" In a second statement on the two-year ban, Mr Trump attacked Facebook's founder. ""Next time I'm in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife,"" the former president said. ""It will be all business!"" The move by Facebook allows Mr Trump to return to the platform before the 2024 presidential election. It also comes as he prepares to again hold the large scale in-person rallies that were a signature of his campaigns and presidency. One of his first is planned for Dallas, Texas, in early July, according to local media. Earlier this week, it emerged that the communications platform set up by Mr Trump in the wake of his social media bans - From the Desk of Donald J Trump - has been permanently shut down. In addition to Facebook, which has over two billion monthly users, Mr Trump has also been banned from Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitch and other social media platforms over the January riot. Last month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally,signed the first law in the US that punishes tech companies for de-platforming politicians. Facebook's dilemma on Trump was complex, involved trade-offs, and was guaranteed to upset millions of people. The fact is - whatever their decision - it was bound to be polarising. But just to be clear: today Facebook, the world's biggest social network, has denied access to its megaphone to a man who 74 million people voted for. They didn't just know him, or approve of him; they voted for him to be US president. That is a big call. Facebook says public figures who violate its rules by inciting unrest or violence will be suspended for a month or, in more serious cases, up to two years. It comes as part of an effort to undo a previous policy of allowing newsworthy political speech despite a potential that it may cause harm. Posts that are deemed worthy of an exception, despite possible violations, may still be allowed but will be given a warning label by Facebook. The company says it will no longer treat ""content posted by politicians any differently"". ""Instead, we will simply apply our newsworthiness balancing test in the same way to all content, measuring whether the public interest value of the content outweighs the potential risk of harm by leaving it up."" The company's Oversight Board found that Mr Trump's initial ban was appropriate, but that there was no rationale for the ban to remain indefinitely. The independent board, which is funded by Facebook, has 20 members who are able to make binding decisions on content. Among the members are legal scholars, journalists, freedom of speech experts and a former prime minister of Denmark. The announcement comes on the same day that regulators in Europe and the UK begin formal anti-trust inquiries into whether Facebook misused customer data.

"Pupils have lost months of school time due to Covid Pupils fell behind again in the second lockdown, losing progress in maths and reading from the autumn term. New research for the government also reveals large regional differences across England in learning loss. It follows the resignation of Sir Kevan Collins, education recovery commissioner for England, whose plans for helping pupils catch up were rejected by ministers as too expensive. The government has invested Â£3.1bn and more money may follow in the autumn. On 4 January, schools in England opened briefly and then closed for a second national lockdown, leaving most pupils learning remotely at home. This research for the government by the Education Policy Institute shows that by March 2021, primary pupils were almost as far behind as after the first lockdown and summer holidays last year. In maths, that meant primary pupils were on average 3.5 months behind where children have been in previous non-pandemic years. For reading, the learning loss by the end of the spring term was an average of 2.2 months for primary pupils. The analysis shows schools helped pupils make progress during the autumn, but much of that was wiped out when they closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children. And some parts of the North East and East Midlands were among the areas worst affected. At the beginning of the autumn term, researchers were able to capture how far behind primary pupils were in maths and reading compared with previous years. PM vows more school catch-up cash in funding row Lockdown left poor pupils further behind in maths Â£13.5bn needed for pupils to catch up, report says This reveals in the South West, pupils in primary school were 1.5 months behind in reading, and two months in maths. But in Yorkshire and Humber, the difference was 2.6 months in reading, and 5.8 months in maths. As the national picture shows that any progress made later in the autumn was lost in early 2021, the regional  differences may remain. The research also confirmed that the poorest pupils had lost more learning than average. Jon Andrews, report co-author and head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute (EPI) said: ""Our data analysis points to a clear penalty faced by disadvantaged pupils during the pandemic - these pupils have seen greater learning losses than their more affluent peers, which risks widening the overall gap in educational attainment."" The research has been published just days after the resignation of Sir Kevan who described government plans to help pupils catch up as ""half-hearted"". He said the government response was ""too narrow"" and was being delivered ""too slowly"". He was reported as having put forward plans costing Â£15bn. Head teachers said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by the  government 's latest  Â£1.4bn Covid recovery package, calling it a ""damp squib"". It followed an existing commitment to spend Â£1.7bn in England's schools. The prime minister said there would ""hopefully"" be more money to come in the autumn, as part of the government's wider spending plans. But the influential economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is warning that delaying decisions until the autumn risks being too late to help the pupils most in need of support. ""If these losses are not properly addressed, then the long-run costs could easily run into the hundreds of billions as a result of lost skills and productivity,"" the IFS says. The IFS researchers point out that the recovery package is smaller than in other countries. The IFS says Â£15bn sounds like a lot of money to spend on education recovery, but spread over three years, it would have averaged about Â£5bn per year, or just over 10% of annual spending on schools pre-Covid. ""If it genuinely helped to mitigate the future lost earnings of today's schoolchildren (which could easily run into the hundreds of billions over the coming decades), it could also prove to be a terrific investment,"" it said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""This research provides further stark evidence of the very severe extent of learning loss among pupils as a result of the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the particularly severe impact on disadvantaged children. ""It is abundantly clear that a recovery programme is urgently required at a scale and scope to address this massive issue."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We have committed to an ambitious, and long-term education recovery plan, including an investment to date of over Â£3bn and a significant expansion of our tutoring programme, to support children and young people to make up for learning lost during the pandemic.""

Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst In
the last 24 hours, mainland China has confirmed nine new symptomatic cases of
Covid-19 in southern Guangdong. This is the only area where the country
currently has an outbreak, and 113 people are in hospital. China
reacts swiftly as soon as single-digit cases of the virus are identified, and
so currently, communities in two cities have local lockdown measures in place:
Guangzhou and Foshan. However, in the last 24 hours, national media have
reported that mutant virus strains of the virus have been identified in
Guangzhou. An extra 140,000 peoplehave been ordered into lockdown,external,
and a mass testing drivewill take place in parts of the city between now and Sunday,external. China
has been lauding uptake of the vaccine in the country at helping prevent wider
transmission. Yesterday,the Global Times newspaper reported,externalthat patients in
Guangdong have largely exhibited little or no symptoms due to having already
had at least one vaccine dose. To
date, more than 723 million vaccine doses have been administered in China, more
than any other country in the world. As China is currently averaging around 20
million doses a day, tomorrowâs stats may be on par with the entire population
of Europe. China
has aims of vaccinating 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June, and is
hoping to reopen to the world in the first half of 2022. 723 million doses
equates to around 51% of Chinaâs population, but this figure includes second
doses. In Zimbabwe, vaccination centres in the capital Harare and second-largest city Bulawayo have been running out of doses - but ministers are urging people, ""please don't panic"". ""The doses are there, they are not in the large numbers that we would like but then that is the challenge that the whole world is facing,"" Agnes Mahomva, the government's Covid-19 response coordinator, said today. She added that Zimbabwe would take another shipment of vaccines ""any minute now"" without saying from where. Zimbabwe has so far shunned Western vaccines, preferring to
use those from China, India and Russia. Meanwhile, the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme says it hopes to send millions of delayed doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine to African countries this month and next. But UN officials say they're depending on a Spanish manufacturing site securing regulatory approval. Asked if any of the coronavirus variants could affect the further plans for restrictions easing in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says: ""We are looking out for these variants all the time. ""New variants do come through all the time - we're always careful and looking for that. ""However, thus far we've been able to open up steps one, two and three without an increase in the number of people going into hospital. That is essentially flat, and so we have been able to make this progress. ""The prime minister, at the start of the roadmap, said it was going to be cautious and irreversible - that is our goal."" He said the government was ""looking at the data all the way through"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Mr Berdimuhamedov holds the title âmaster of sportsâ in Turkmenistan The 2021 Track Cycling World Championships, scheduled to be
held in Turkmenistan in October,are to be moved to a new
venue, a blow to leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedovâs plans to bring a
prestige sporting event to his country. Governing body the UCI says the decision was taken ""at
the request of the organisers"" because ""health constraints and
restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic make it impossible to stage the
event in the country"". Turkmenistan has long held that it has no cases of the virus
within its borders, but diplomats and foreign media with contacts inside the
country say that this is not the case. Despite the claim of zero cases, citizens must wear
face masks, while restaurants and mosques were closed until April. The
explanation given was that âpathogensâ were blowing in from abroad, causing
pneumonia. The loss of the championships is embarrassing for
Turkmenistanâs autocratic leader, with the news coming on the same day he took
a symbolic cycle ride around the capital Ashgabat to mark World Bicycle Day. Mr Berdimuhamedov, known as ""Arkadag"" (Protector) to his
people, is often photographed flatteringly taking part in sporting events such
ascycling,
horse riding, and rally driving. But abroad, heâs criticised for his
disregard of human rights and mismanagement of the economy. With a tightly-controlled state media, itâs unlikely that
Turkmen citizens will hear much about this setback to Arkadagâs love of
prestige projects. Matt Hancock has defended the government's decision to remove Portugal from the coronavrius ""green"" travel list - a move that has prompted fury in the travel industry. He says after a rise in cases there, a ""safety first"" approach was needed. ""We are vigilant on international travel and we are very cautious,"" says the health secretary. ""There's a reason for that - and that is the risk of new variants that undermine the vaccine rollout programme is a really serious risk for this country."" Countries are only put on the green list when the government is ""highly confident"" it is safe to travel, he adds. The decision on Portugal had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India, he says. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" says Hancock. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" He says that fortunately the vaccine does work against that variant after two doses. But he warns that everyone has to ""remain vigilant"". ""My first job is to protect lives here at home and protect the opening up that we've managed to see over the past months,"" he adds. ""That does mean being very cautious on international travel.""

Outdoor service can resume from 7 June Vladimir Putin has said today that he's going to allow foreign citizens to get vaccinated in Russia for a fee. Speaking at Russia's annual economic conference in St Petersburg, Putin said he'd ordered officials to prepare the ground for vaccine tourism. There are four vaccines currently approved for domestic use in Russia, the most common of which is the Russian-produced Sputnik V. Putin also accused some countries of refusing to buy certain vaccines - such as Sputnik V - for ""politically motivated"" reasons. There has been a lot of talk today about a mutation of the Delta variant of Covid - the one first identified in India - which has been found in Nepal. Now Nepal's prime minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli says it is the UK's duty to provide vaccines for the country, given the political ties between the two - which includes the service of Nepali Gurkhas in the British Army. The country has been hit hard by the latest wave of Covid and there have been 4,000 deaths in the last month. With fewer than 3% of the population fully vaccinated, the countryâs prime minister asks Boris Johnson to send doses. The UK has sent ventilators and PPE, but Sharma Oli says it is vaccines he urgently needed. He says the country is looking to buy doses and warns it will be ""disastrous"" if Nepal does not get them. It comes as Nepalâs health ministry has refuted reports of a new variant  emerging in the country, saying the dominant strain is the Delta - Indian - variant. BBC South Asia correspondent Rajini Vaidyanathan says health officials are very angry at the reports coming out of the UK. Read more here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has welcomed the decision made by the independent regulator,which says that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective for children from the age of 12 upwards. As for next steps, he says: ""We will take clinical advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on how that should be taken forward, and then we will follow that clinical advice"". He says the UK has ""enough supply"" to vaccinate children, should that be advised. Hancock also says vaccinating children here would take priority over donating vaccine doses to other countries around the world. ""My first duty as health secretary for the UK is to make sure that the UK is protected and safe, and whilst thankfully children are very rarely badly affected by Covid themselves, they can still pass on the disease,"" he says. But he adds that he was working with his international counterparts to make sure people can get access to the vaccine around the world. He was speaking after a summit of G7 health ministers in Oxford. The daily figures also show that the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now 39.9 million, while the number who have received both doses is 26.7 million. That's more than 75% of the adult population who have had one jab, and 50% who have had two jabs. The number of cases reported today, 6,238, is the highest figure reported since 25 March. The seven-day average for cases is up by 40%, amid concerns the Delta variant is fuelling a rise in infections. However, the seven-day average for deaths is down by 5.2% and hospitalisations are down by 2.2%. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Anti-vaccine activist Kate
Shemirani has been
struck off the nursing register for promoting
conspiracy theories about coronavirus. She has been banned from practising for at
least five years âon both public protection and public interest groundsâ by the
Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). At a fitness to practise hearing, the panel concluded that Ms Shemirani
âused her nursing status as a way of endorsing her own distorted propagandaâ on
social media and at public events. It
also highlighted her âdeeply offensiveâ remarks about nurses and doctors being part of a âgenocideâ. Ms Shemirani has
gathered tens of thousands of followers on social media with her false claims â including denying coronavirus exists,
blaming the symptoms of Covid-19 on 5G radio waves and drawing parallels
between the National Health Service and Nazi Germany. Her son Sebastian, who I interviewed last year, raised concerns about the damaging impact of her views on
public health and their own relationship. Watch the interview here There have been a further 6,238 cases and 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK,according to the latest government figures.,external Yesterday, 5,274 cases and 18 deaths were reported. Simon Smith, who is currently in Portugal, says his family has been racing to find Covid tests to get a return flight to the UK on Saturday morning. The property developer from Stamford, Lincolnshire, who owns a villa in the Lagos area, says he has visited five medical centres and the main hospital to try and get his family tested. He says he was turned away from one centre after it ran out of testing kits. Mr Smith, who is abroad with his wife and two children, aged two and four, says: ""There were about 35 people in the queue, all British, and they told us, 'the first 15 are okay, but the rest of you might as well go home because we don't have enough tests'."" ""It's really safe here in Portugal,"" he adds. ""On the Algarve, there are very few cases, and all the restaurants and shops take it really seriously."" The family has been told the airport has a small amount of Covid tests available, so plan on turning up to their flight five hours early in the hopes of getting one. ""If we can't get that, we can't fly,"" he says. ""And then we are going to be stuck here, and then have to face ten days' quarantine. I have meetings on Friday, I can't afford ten days' quarantine, it is a joke."" More than 3,000 pages of private emails sent to and from US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci have been released. Dr Fauci, a National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism. The emails, dating from January to June 2020, offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans. So what exactly have we learned from them? Read the full storyhere Argentina is poised to start full-scale production of Russiaâs
Sputnik V vaccine â the first Latin American country to do so. The vaccine, already exported globally, is reported to have
an efficacy of 91.6% after one dose. Test batches have been produced at the Richmond labs in
Pilar, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. In December, Argentina began
vaccinating with Sputnik V flown in from Russia. Confirmed deaths from Covid-19 have surged above 530 daily
in Argentina, Our World in Data reports. Like Brazil and much of South America it is being
ravaged by coronavirus. In April, Argentinian President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, 62, caught Covid, despite
having had two Sputnik V jabs. Were it not for that vaccination, he said, he
would have suffered much worse symptoms. In Europe, Hungary is vaccinating widely with
Sputnik V and it is being manufactured in Serbia, besides Russia. Many
countries have imported Sputnik V, including ones unable to get deliveries of
Western vaccines. More about Sputnik V here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9866796

Dr Fauci, a National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism. The emails, dating from January to June 2020, offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans. So what exactly have we learned from them? Read the full storyhere Argentina is poised to start full-scale production of Russiaâs
Sputnik V vaccine â the first Latin American country to do so. The vaccine, already exported globally, is reported to have
an efficacy of 91.6% after one dose. Test batches have been produced at the Richmond labs in
Pilar, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. In December, Argentina began
vaccinating with Sputnik V flown in from Russia. Confirmed deaths from Covid-19 have surged above 530 daily
in Argentina, Our World in Data reports. Like Brazil and much of South America it is being
ravaged by coronavirus. In April, Argentinian President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, 62, caught Covid, despite
having had two Sputnik V jabs. Were it not for that vaccination, he said, he
would have suffered much worse symptoms. In Europe, Hungary is vaccinating widely with
Sputnik V and it is being manufactured in Serbia, besides Russia. Many
countries have imported Sputnik V, including ones unable to get deliveries of
Western vaccines. More about Sputnik V here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.7231076e-06

"A fresh row has broken out over the influence of the Unite trade union after leaked emails highlighted plans to challenge sitting Labour MPs. Former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson accused Unite of playing ""hard left games"" that alienate mainstream voters. Watson, who stood down at the 2019 election, made a rare foray back into the political world after Newsnight saw emails by a West Midlands Unite activist outlining plans to try and unseat leading Labour figures. In an email dated 12 February 2018 addressed to a senior Unite official Howard Beckett, the activist Steve Price outlined plans to ""put the skids"" under Mr Watson, then the MP for West Bromwich East, and former minister John Spellar, who represents Warley, in the West Midlands. Newsnight has also seen internal Unite emails in which officials discussed Mr Price's first email. One said that one hour may not be enough time to deal with all the issues he had raised. Unite contest: Who's running and what's at stake? Unite to elect new leader by end of summer Tom Watson stood down over Labour 'brutality' In a second email on 15 March 2018, also addressed to Howard Beckett, Steve Price wrote about how his networking was vital in ""building trusted left roots across 59 constituencies"". Price also wrote that it had been agreed that he would be paid but he needed a ""form of words to describe what I'm (not) doing"". Howard Beckett is standing to be the next Unite general secretary In a statement to Newsnight a Unite spokesperson said that Steve Price's plan was not accepted by the the union and no payments were made. Steve Price did not respond. But the union strongly defended its political activity. The spokesperson said: ""It is a long-established practice across the entire trade union movement is to fund candidates who stand on a platform that will advance the lives of our members. This is not unique to Unite."" But Tom Watson told Newsnight that he was alarmed by the emails. He said: ""I think if people had known that these conversations were taking place when they were taking place, there would have been real shock. ""I think even Jeremy Corbyn would have condemned that kind of behaviour."" Tom Watson stood down as an MP before the 2019 general election The former Labour deputy leader added: ""The problem, I think, for the Labour Party is whilst Unite carries on with its own internal politics and plays these hard left games and appeals to its narrow audience, that plays very badly with mainstream voters on the doorstep."" Howard Beckett, one of Unite's assistant general secretaries who hopes to replace Len McCluskey as the union's general secretary, told Newsnight that the ideas outlined in the emails from Steve Price addressed to him were never followed. Beckett said: ""Steve made a proposal to me and I decided to go in a different direction. ""There was nothing wrong with the proposal that Steve made. The idea that Tom Watson is shocked by this is quite extraordinary. But I decided to go in a different direction...So no the arrangement was never formalised with Steve."" Former Labour minister Dame Margaret Hodge has reported Unite to the police after Steve Price wrote in one of his emails that it had been agreed he would be paid via a third party. Trade unions have to declare spending on political matters. Howard Beckett dismissed the police complaint by Margaret Hodge as ""laughable"" and ""risible"". ""Margaret Hodge is making a political stunt. She's obviously doing it because of the fact that there is a Unite general secretary election.

"This video can not be played Covid: Social distancing to stay as 'personal repertoire' Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said it remained one of the ""strongest defences"" against Covid. The warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing. Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. But, Mr Drakeford said he was ""not certain there is a huge thirst"" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule. ""I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,"" he told a coronavirus press briefing. ""Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" Allowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased. The decision to delay comes amid ""growing concern"" overthe Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated. There are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? Welsh government signals return of sports fans Mr Drakeford said: ""The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle. ""This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults."" However, he added: ""We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales. ""That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant."" The lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June. The changes - described as a phased move toWales' alert level one,external- will begin from Monday. It means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time. A further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households. Further rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when anending to restrictions in Englandmay happen. Call for pub rules to be lifted Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Pubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has calledfor all significant restrictions to be liftedbefore July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule. WeMakeEvents organised protests and campaigns to help support the arts Sarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was ""great news"" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns. In recent weeks aseries of test eventshave been held, including the Tafwyl andEid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators. Ms Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's ""cautious"" approach, the test events had been ""incredibly restrictive"" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing. She added: ""The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it. ""But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work."" Up to 4,000 standing can attend outdoor events in Wales from 7 June Annual events, such as Brecon Jazz andGreen Man Festival, were waiting to seeif they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September. ""There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,"" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. ""It's great to have live music back."" The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""There's Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that."" Plaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while ""the economic devastation of the pandemic remains."" Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the ""cautious"" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were ""exhausted"". She also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits. Despite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to thatdemanded last year. ""I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe."" Wales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%. Figures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales. The case rate in Walesis currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days. A cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible fora spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23. There have been no new deaths with covid reported in Walesfor the past nine days. RUGBY - THE COST OF CONCUSSION:Have opportunities to protect players from brain injuries been missed?

"Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday. British Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes. The move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days. But travel firm Tui says50% of passengers due to travel there in Juneare still planning to go. Any travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than Â£540. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" he said. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" Speaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that ""tough"" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Covid infections rise by two-thirds in UK - ONS Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' However, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the ""logic"" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. He also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: ""I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers."" It comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2. The latest figures show,externala further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported. No new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June. Labour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or ""at the very least"" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant. The travel industryhas criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces ""another lost summer"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not ""based on any science or public health"", and that  he did not understand why the UK ""which has been so successful with vaccines"" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine.

Now he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school. ""We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,"" he says. But with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal. The extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost Â£120 each, he says, adding Â£960 to the family's holiday bill. A week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says. ""No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,"" he says. ""Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign."" Portugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said. Some 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures. Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? 'Let us go on holiday and live our lives' Public Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. The number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks. On 2 June,Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. PHEbelieves the Delta variant is now dominant in the UKand that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. Earlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be ""60% more transmissible"" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha. Asked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing ""towards the direction of being cautious"".

"This video can not be played G7: 'I believe we can make significant progress' - Sunak A global agreement to end the ""race to the bottom"" on corporate taxation is within sight, according to the French and German finance ministers. France's Bruno le Maire told the BBC the G7 club of rich nations were ""just one millimetre away from a historic agreement"" on a global minimum rate. He urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. The German finance minister said a 15% rate would help pay back Covid debt Tax on big tech and multi-nationals has been a source of friction between the US and fellow G7 countries such as the UK. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said it was important to stop the world's biggest companies from dodging tax. He said it was ""absolutely necessary"" to reach a deal in order to ""get out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes todayâ¦especially after the Covid crisis and all the money we spent to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy."" French finance minister Bruno le Maire told the BBC any deal must include both a tech tax on digital activities as well as a minimum rate Mr Le Maire also urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get ""on board"". He added: ""European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough"". Both ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point. Mr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a ""starting point"". He said: ""If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%."" However, Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a ""turning point"" after years of going in the other direction. It came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he was ""confident"" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders. Finance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two day meeting which starts in London on Friday. Ahead of the G7 talks, starting in London on Friday, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system ""fit for the 21st Century"". In a letter to The Guardian,external, they wrote: ""Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it."" Those attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its ""historic nature"". Mr Scholz told me they'll ""have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation"". Another finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. The UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it. There are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording ""at least 15%"" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. The US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a ""non-starter"", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. The end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. This could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals. On Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms. However, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July. US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Mr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting. Speaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: ""Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners. ""I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend."" Governments have become increasingly concerned about the amount of tax paid by US tech giants. The ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues. The meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year,according to The Guardian,external. Microsoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP. Microsoft said this was  due to ""a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain"". ""Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" a spokesperson added. All G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world. Germany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is ""a promising start"" but said G7 nations must reach ""a common position on a new international tax system"" in London before more nations meet next month. They wrote,external: ""We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens."" The UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms. It is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook. The Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a ""floor"". Finance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

"Jobs vacancies in the UK are soaring but there are not enough workers to fill them, a report suggests. The easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of various sectors meant demand for workers rose at its fastest rate in May for more than 23 years, according to a KPMG survey. But the number of staff available to fill those jobs declined at the quickest rate since 2017. KPMG called on the government and firms to address skills gaps. Workers were especially needed in IT and computing, which has been a long-term trend, as well as hospitality, the survey found. Hospitality venues arestruggling to fill thousands of job vacancieswith waiting staff and chefs in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease, industry body UK Hospitality said last week. Many hospitality firms have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, including rates holidays and the furlough scheme, and staff have lost their jobs or seen their hours reduced. The retail industry saw the least demand for workers. Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers This monthly survey is based on responses from 400 recruitment and employment agencies and is yet more evidence of the economic recovery gathering pace. It says hiring activity has intensified across all job categories, particularly in IT and computing and hotels and catering. But there's also a shortage of workers. Hospitality and events firms have been struggling to get the staff they need to cope with a post-lockdown surge in demand. Some are warning of a staffing crisis this summer, partly caused by gaps left by EU workers who have returned home because of Brexit and the pandemic. The survey's authors say skills and labour shortages, that already existed before the pandemic, are now the most pressing issue in the jobs market. This means many employers will need to look at the wages and benefits they offer at a time when they're still struggling to financially recover from the last 14 months. The jobs market ""seems to be firing on all cylinders"" said KPMG partner Claire Warnes. ""But the deterioration in staff supply intensified this month... This is a worrying trend,"" she added. She called for government and firms to ""urgently address the skills gap"". Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC), said: ""With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus - and Covid has only made them worse. ""This is the most pressing issue in the jobs market right now, and has the potential to slow down the recovery."" A government spokesperson said: ""Our multi-billion pound plan for jobs, including the Kickstart scheme, is supporting employers across the country to create jobs and help jobseekers get the skills and experience needed to develop their careers and fulfil roles for years to come. ""Additionally, we have increased the apprenticeship hiring incentive to Â£3,000 per new apprentice hire and our lifetime skills guarantee - worth the equivalent of around Â£3,400 per person - ensures all adults can gain new skills and qualifications.""

"The first minister says making changes to indoor rules on Monday was âa riskâ he was not prepared to take A decision on increasing the numbers able to meet indoors will not happen until at least late June It comes amid ""growing concern"" over the variant first identified in India Outdoor concerts, festivals and sporting events can resume in Wales from Monday Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens Mark Drakeford says there is no need for a local lockdown in parts of Conwy county where a cluster of variant cases has been found James McCarthy and Richard Porter That's it from the BBC Wales live page for today. Thank you for joining us. The main points: The first minister said it is âvery good newsâ that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children of secondary school age. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government will now wait for recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), before confirming how to proceed. âWe have already been in conversations with the sector on the best way we can do that (if the JCVI recommend vaccinations in secondary school age children),"" he told the press conference. âA lot of that will depend on timing on whether we can do it in the summer term or in the autumn."" He added schools already have a vaccination programme for flu vaccines in autumn and the government will âlook to see if its possible to get some synergies with that vaccination programme.â Plaid Cymru's Sioned Williams said businesses still need assistance while âthe economic devastation of the pandemic remainsâ. She said: âWe welcome these changes today, but as things start to reopen we really need to make sure that our businesses, especially in the hospitality sector, have continuous and  increased supportâ. She said businesses needed help to âkeep their heads above the waterâ. Social distancing in Wales could continue for the rest of the year, Mark Drakeford has said. The first minister said it remains one of the âstrongest defencesâ against Covid. He said: âI have been very struck by the way, as I go around Wales...  people continue to be very careful about the way they behave when other people are around. âIâm not certain myself there is a huge thirst for people to give up some of the safeguards, that we are all able to contribute in the way that we behave in our own lives. âI think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year. âWhether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about and ask people to do in their own lives, that will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" New Covid rules are coming to Wales from Monday. The shift is part is part of a phased move to level one resrictions by the Welsh government. The authorities are proceeding cautiously because of concerns about the Delta variant, which originated in India. There are currently 97 cases in Wales, up 67% on last week.  The first minister says local health boards have the ability to ""speed up"" second doses of Covid-19 vaccines if needed to combat local clusters. But Mark Drakeford said ""the first vaccination is also very important"" and it remains a priority to get all adults vaccinated with one dose. He said once first doses were completed there would be additional resources to speed up second doses of the vaccine. The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""Thereâs Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh governmentâs coffers for business support but there was no mention of that.â The first minister says there currently isn't a need to have local lockdowns in Conwy county's Covid hotspots. Mark Drakeford said: ""We don't think the current circumstances require them."" But he said local measures do ""remain part of the potential repertoire"". The first minister said he can âunderstand and sympathiseâ with those planning weddings about the continued limitations on indoor gatherings. ""The science is improving on this issue,"" Mark Drakeford said. ""I received a presentation from our scientific advisers that drew evidence from across the world in the last 15 months. ""You are between 15 and 20 times more likely to catch coronavirus in indoor settings than outdoor settings."" ""The distinction that we have made all the way through with outdoors being better than indoors has now been confirmed from data from around the world,â he said. Restrictions on numbers indoors would be reviewed in the coming weeks, he said. The first minister says moving Wales fully into alert level one on Monday is âa riskâ heâs not prepared to take. âThe reason why it is not sensible to move wholesale on Monday into alert level one is the  concern over the new variant,"" he said. âWhile at the moment that it is not in large number in Wales and there isnât community spread, I think itâs a risk that would not be sensible to takeâ. He said a âa pause of two weeksâ would allow more evidence to be gathered and reviewed, and let more people get vaccinated. The ""considerable majority"" of the 97 identified cases of the Indian or Delta variant in Wales are from people who have not been vaccinated, according to the first minister. But Mark Drakeford said some people who have caught the variant ""have had vaccination in the past"". He added there was ""no evidence in Wales so far"" that the 97 cases have needed hospital treatment. ""Most of the clusters of the new variant are close-knit clusters where local public health teams are well on top of their contacts, have traced them and know what people are doing. ""The Conwy cluster is the largest cluster. ""We have had examples there of people contracting the virus in schools and in workplaces. ""There are up to 300 people self-isolating as a result, but we don't have definitive evidence that it is now at a community spread level,"" he said. The largest cluster is in the Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay area Mark Drakeford said the variant was ""a sharp reminder that the pandemic is not yet over and that coronavirus continues to be with us."" He said the best way for people to protect themselves was ""to keep doing the things, which have kept us all safe for so long and helped to keep the virus under control in Wales."" ""That means keeping your distance, washing your hands regularly, wearing a face covering in indoor public places, working from home whenever possible and keeping indoor spaces ventilated. ""It also means saying yes to vaccination â all the evidence we have so far says that two doses offers protection against this new variant,"" he said. The first minister says the next set of decisions about relaxing restrictions on indoor events and activities will be made when there is more information about the Delta variant. Mark Drakeford said: ""This will also allow us to continue to focus our efforts on vaccinating people. ""By June 21, a further 90,000 people will have received their first dose of the vaccine and 180,000 more people will have completed their two-dose course. Mark Drakeford confirmed the next stages of the easing of restrictions. He said: âWe have the headroom to move into alert level one as from Monday of next week. âWe will do this in a phased way, focusing on relaxing restrictions around outdoor events and activities first because the evidence suggests the risk of infection is between 15 and 20 times lower outdoors than it is indoors."" Mark Drakeford says the Welsh government is âcarefully monitoringâ the spread of the Indian, or Delta, variant in England and warns that Wales might ânot be immuneâ. The first minister said it had spread in many parts of England, despite the restrictions in place there. âThere are now more than 10,700 confirmed cases in England, largely linked to eight areas of the country, mainly in the north-west. ""There are a further 1,500 cases in Scotland. âIt has quickly become the dominant form the virus in new cases recorded in both Scotland and England. âIf that pattern continues, it is important to say to everybody here today, we will not be immune from it here in Wales. âAlready we have identified 97 cases in Wales and there will be more. ""Of those we know about, everyone has been tested, advised to isolate and their contacts traced. âThis includes a large cluster of cases in Conwy in north Wales, which is under close investigation,"" he said. The variant, first detected in India, has been given the name Delta by the World Health Organization. First Minister Mark Drakeford says coronavirus rates in Wales continue to be âvery lowâ. Mr Drakeford told the press conference: âIn Wales today, the seven-day case rate continues to be very low at fewer than 10 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is also below 1%.â He said he was glad to be able to confirm that there have been no new deaths recorded by Public Health Wales in the past nine days. And he also said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus was at the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. First Minister Mark Drakeford is starting today's briefing. We'll tell you what he says here, along with reaction to the changes announced for Monday. You can watch by following the link at the top of this page.

But Unicef says the UK and the other G7 countries could share 20% of their supplies in the next three months without impacting their own domestic rollouts. Read more on the issue here. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst In
the last 24 hours, mainland China has confirmed nine new symptomatic cases of
Covid-19 in southern Guangdong. This is the only area where the country
currently has an outbreak, and 113 people are in hospital. China
reacts swiftly as soon as single-digit cases of the virus are identified, and
so currently, communities in two cities have local lockdown measures in place:
Guangzhou and Foshan. However, in the last 24 hours, national media have
reported that mutant virus strains of the virus have been identified in
Guangzhou. An extra 140,000 peoplehave been ordered into lockdown,external,
and a mass testing drivewill take place in parts of the city between now and Sunday,external. China
has been lauding uptake of the vaccine in the country at helping prevent wider
transmission. Yesterday,the Global Times newspaper reported,externalthat patients in
Guangdong have largely exhibited little or no symptoms due to having already
had at least one vaccine dose. To
date, more than 723 million vaccine doses have been administered in China, more
than any other country in the world. As China is currently averaging around 20
million doses a day, tomorrowâs stats may be on par with the entire population
of Europe. China
has aims of vaccinating 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June, and is
hoping to reopen to the world in the first half of 2022. 723 million doses
equates to around 51% of Chinaâs population, but this figure includes second
doses. In Zimbabwe, vaccination centres in the capital Harare and second-largest city Bulawayo have been running out of doses - but ministers are urging people, ""please don't panic"". ""The doses are there, they are not in the large numbers that we would like but then that is the challenge that the whole world is facing,"" Agnes Mahomva, the government's Covid-19 response coordinator, said today. She added that Zimbabwe would take another shipment of vaccines ""any minute now"" without saying from where. Zimbabwe has so far shunned Western vaccines, preferring to
use those from China, India and Russia. Meanwhile, the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme says it hopes to send millions of delayed doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine to African countries this month and next. But UN officials say they're depending on a Spanish manufacturing site securing regulatory approval. Asked if any of the coronavirus variants could affect the further plans for restrictions easing in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says: ""We are looking out for these variants all the time. ""New variants do come through all the time - we're always careful and looking for that. ""However, thus far we've been able to open up steps one, two and three without an increase in the number of people going into hospital. That is essentially flat, and so we have been able to make this progress. ""The prime minister, at the start of the roadmap, said it was going to be cautious and irreversible - that is our goal."" He said the government was ""looking at the data all the way through"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Mr Berdimuhamedov holds the title âmaster of sportsâ in Turkmenistan The 2021 Track Cycling World Championships, scheduled to be
held in Turkmenistan in October,are to be moved to a new
venue, a blow to leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedovâs plans to bring a
prestige sporting event to his country. Governing body the UCI says the decision was taken ""at
the request of the organisers"" because ""health constraints and
restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic make it impossible to stage the
event in the country"". Turkmenistan has long held that it has no cases of the virus
within its borders, but diplomats and foreign media with contacts inside the
country say that this is not the case. Despite the claim of zero cases, citizens must wear
face masks, while restaurants and mosques were closed until April. The
explanation given was that âpathogensâ were blowing in from abroad, causing
pneumonia. The loss of the championships is embarrassing for
Turkmenistanâs autocratic leader, with the news coming on the same day he took
a symbolic cycle ride around the capital Ashgabat to mark World Bicycle Day. Mr Berdimuhamedov, known as ""Arkadag"" (Protector) to his
people, is often photographed flatteringly taking part in sporting events such
ascycling,
horse riding, and rally driving. But abroad, heâs criticised for his
disregard of human rights and mismanagement of the economy. With a tightly-controlled state media, itâs unlikely that
Turkmen citizens will hear much about this setback to Arkadagâs love of
prestige projects. Matt Hancock has defended the government's decision to remove Portugal from the coronavrius ""green"" travel list - a move that has prompted fury in the travel industry. He says after a rise in cases there, a ""safety first"" approach was needed. ""We are vigilant on international travel and we are very cautious,"" says the health secretary. ""There's a reason for that - and that is the risk of new variants that undermine the vaccine rollout programme is a really serious risk for this country."" Countries are only put on the green list when the government is ""highly confident"" it is safe to travel, he adds. The decision on Portugal had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India, he says. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" says Hancock. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" He says that fortunately the vaccine does work against that variant after two doses. But he warns that everyone has to ""remain vigilant"". ""My first job is to protect lives here at home and protect the opening up that we've managed to see over the past months,"" he adds. ""That does mean being very cautious on international travel.""

Outdoor service can resume from 7 June Vladimir Putin has said today that he's going to allow foreign citizens to get vaccinated in Russia for a fee. Speaking at Russia's annual economic conference in St Petersburg, Putin said he'd ordered officials to prepare the ground for vaccine tourism. There are four vaccines currently approved for domestic use in Russia, the most common of which is the Russian-produced Sputnik V. Putin also accused some countries of refusing to buy certain vaccines - such as Sputnik V - for ""politically motivated"" reasons. There has been a lot of talk today about a mutation of the Delta variant of Covid - the one first identified in India - which has been found in Nepal. Now Nepal's prime minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli says it is the UK's duty to provide vaccines for the country, given the political ties between the two - which includes the service of Nepali Gurkhas in the British Army. The country has been hit hard by the latest wave of Covid and there have been 4,000 deaths in the last month. With fewer than 3% of the population fully vaccinated, the countryâs prime minister asks Boris Johnson to send doses. The UK has sent ventilators and PPE, but Sharma Oli says it is vaccines he urgently needed. He says the country is looking to buy doses and warns it will be ""disastrous"" if Nepal does not get them. It comes as Nepalâs health ministry has refuted reports of a new variant  emerging in the country, saying the dominant strain is the Delta - Indian - variant. BBC South Asia correspondent Rajini Vaidyanathan says health officials are very angry at the reports coming out of the UK. Read more here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has welcomed the decision made by the independent regulator,which says that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective for children from the age of 12 upwards. As for next steps, he says: ""We will take clinical advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on how that should be taken forward, and then we will follow that clinical advice"". He says the UK has ""enough supply"" to vaccinate children, should that be advised. Hancock also says vaccinating children here would take priority over donating vaccine doses to other countries around the world. ""My first duty as health secretary for the UK is to make sure that the UK is protected and safe, and whilst thankfully children are very rarely badly affected by Covid themselves, they can still pass on the disease,"" he says. But he adds that he was working with his international counterparts to make sure people can get access to the vaccine around the world. He was speaking after a summit of G7 health ministers in Oxford. The daily figures also show that the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now 39.9 million, while the number who have received both doses is 26.7 million. That's more than 75% of the adult population who have had one jab, and 50% who have had two jabs. The number of cases reported today, 6,238, is the highest figure reported since 25 March. The seven-day average for cases is up by 40%, amid concerns the Delta variant is fuelling a rise in infections. However, the seven-day average for deaths is down by 5.2% and hospitalisations are down by 2.2%. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Anti-vaccine activist Kate

âused her nursing status as a way of endorsing her own distorted propagandaâ on
social media and at public events. It
also highlighted her âdeeply offensiveâ remarks about nurses and doctors being part of a âgenocideâ. Ms Shemirani has

Simon Smith, who is currently in Portugal, says his family has been racing to find Covid tests to get a return flight to the UK on Saturday morning. The property developer from Stamford, Lincolnshire, who owns a villa in the Lagos area, says he has visited five medical centres and the main hospital to try and get his family tested. He says he was turned away from one centre after it ran out of testing kits. Mr Smith, who is abroad with his wife and two children, aged two and four, says: ""There were about 35 people in the queue, all British, and they told us, 'the first 15 are okay, but the rest of you might as well go home because we don't have enough tests'."" ""It's really safe here in Portugal,"" he adds. ""On the Algarve, there are very few cases, and all the restaurants and shops take it really seriously."" The family has been told the airport has a small amount of Covid tests available, so plan on turning up to their flight five hours early in the hopes of getting one. ""If we can't get that, we can't fly,"" he says. ""And then we are going to be stuck here, and then have to face ten days' quarantine. I have meetings on Friday, I can't afford ten days' quarantine, it is a joke.""

Pilar, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. In December, Argentina began
vaccinating with Sputnik V flown in from Russia. Confirmed deaths from Covid-19 have surged above 530 daily

ravaged by coronavirus. In April, Argentinian President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, 62, caught Covid, despite
having had two Sputnik V jabs. Were it not for that vaccination, he said, he
would have suffered much worse symptoms. In Europe, Hungary is vaccinating widely with
Sputnik V and it is being manufactured in Serbia, besides Russia. Many
countries have imported Sputnik V, including ones unable to get deliveries of
Western vaccines. More about Sputnik V here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9330787
"The first minister says making changes to indoor rules on Monday was âa riskâ he was not prepared to take A decision on increasing the numbers able to meet indoors will not happen until at least late June It comes amid ""growing concern"" over the variant first identified in India Outdoor concerts, festivals and sporting events can resume in Wales from Monday Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens Mark Drakeford says there is no need for a local lockdown in parts of Conwy county where a cluster of variant cases has been found James McCarthy and Richard Porter That's it from the BBC Wales live page for today. Thank you for joining us. The main points: The first minister said it is âvery good newsâ that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children of secondary school age. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government will now wait for recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), before confirming how to proceed. âWe have already been in conversations with the sector on the best way we can do that (if the JCVI recommend vaccinations in secondary school age children),"" he told the press conference. âA lot of that will depend on timing on whether we can do it in the summer term or in the autumn."" He added schools already have a vaccination programme for flu vaccines in autumn and the government will âlook to see if its possible to get some synergies with that vaccination programme.â Plaid Cymru's Sioned Williams said businesses still need assistance while âthe economic devastation of the pandemic remainsâ. She said: âWe welcome these changes today, but as things start to reopen we really need to make sure that our businesses, especially in the hospitality sector, have continuous and  increased supportâ. She said businesses needed help to âkeep their heads above the waterâ. Social distancing in Wales could continue for the rest of the year, Mark Drakeford has said. The first minister said it remains one of the âstrongest defencesâ against Covid. He said: âI have been very struck by the way, as I go around Wales...  people continue to be very careful about the way they behave when other people are around. âIâm not certain myself there is a huge thirst for people to give up some of the safeguards, that we are all able to contribute in the way that we behave in our own lives. âI think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year. âWhether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about and ask people to do in their own lives, that will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" New Covid rules are coming to Wales from Monday. The shift is part is part of a phased move to level one resrictions by the Welsh government. The authorities are proceeding cautiously because of concerns about the Delta variant, which originated in India. There are currently 97 cases in Wales, up 67% on last week.  The first minister says local health boards have the ability to ""speed up"" second doses of Covid-19 vaccines if needed to combat local clusters. But Mark Drakeford said ""the first vaccination is also very important"" and it remains a priority to get all adults vaccinated with one dose. He said once first doses were completed there would be additional resources to speed up second doses of the vaccine. The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""Thereâs Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh governmentâs coffers for business support but there was no mention of that.â The first minister says there currently isn't a need to have local lockdowns in Conwy county's Covid hotspots. Mark Drakeford said: ""We don't think the current circumstances require them."" But he said local measures do ""remain part of the potential repertoire"". The first minister said he can âunderstand and sympathiseâ with those planning weddings about the continued limitations on indoor gatherings. ""The science is improving on this issue,"" Mark Drakeford said. ""I received a presentation from our scientific advisers that drew evidence from across the world in the last 15 months. ""You are between 15 and 20 times more likely to catch coronavirus in indoor settings than outdoor settings."" ""The distinction that we have made all the way through with outdoors being better than indoors has now been confirmed from data from around the world,â he said. Restrictions on numbers indoors would be reviewed in the coming weeks, he said. The first minister says moving Wales fully into alert level one on Monday is âa riskâ heâs not prepared to take. âThe reason why it is not sensible to move wholesale on Monday into alert level one is the  concern over the new variant,"" he said. âWhile at the moment that it is not in large number in Wales and there isnât community spread, I think itâs a risk that would not be sensible to takeâ. He said a âa pause of two weeksâ would allow more evidence to be gathered and reviewed, and let more people get vaccinated. The ""considerable majority"" of the 97 identified cases of the Indian or Delta variant in Wales are from people who have not been vaccinated, according to the first minister. But Mark Drakeford said some people who have caught the variant ""have had vaccination in the past"". He added there was ""no evidence in Wales so far"" that the 97 cases have needed hospital treatment. ""Most of the clusters of the new variant are close-knit clusters where local public health teams are well on top of their contacts, have traced them and know what people are doing. ""The Conwy cluster is the largest cluster. ""We have had examples there of people contracting the virus in schools and in workplaces. ""There are up to 300 people self-isolating as a result, but we don't have definitive evidence that it is now at a community spread level,"" he said. The largest cluster is in the Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay area Mark Drakeford said the variant was ""a sharp reminder that the pandemic is not yet over and that coronavirus continues to be with us."" He said the best way for people to protect themselves was ""to keep doing the things, which have kept us all safe for so long and helped to keep the virus under control in Wales."" ""That means keeping your distance, washing your hands regularly, wearing a face covering in indoor public places, working from home whenever possible and keeping indoor spaces ventilated. ""It also means saying yes to vaccination â all the evidence we have so far says that two doses offers protection against this new variant,"" he said. The first minister says the next set of decisions about relaxing restrictions on indoor events and activities will be made when there is more information about the Delta variant. Mark Drakeford said: ""This will also allow us to continue to focus our efforts on vaccinating people. ""By June 21, a further 90,000 people will have received their first dose of the vaccine and 180,000 more people will have completed their two-dose course. Mark Drakeford confirmed the next stages of the easing of restrictions. He said: âWe have the headroom to move into alert level one as from Monday of next week. âWe will do this in a phased way, focusing on relaxing restrictions around outdoor events and activities first because the evidence suggests the risk of infection is between 15 and 20 times lower outdoors than it is indoors."" Mark Drakeford says the Welsh government is âcarefully monitoringâ the spread of the Indian, or Delta, variant in England and warns that Wales might ânot be immuneâ. The first minister said it had spread in many parts of England, despite the restrictions in place there. âThere are now more than 10,700 confirmed cases in England, largely linked to eight areas of the country, mainly in the north-west. ""There are a further 1,500 cases in Scotland. âIt has quickly become the dominant form the virus in new cases recorded in both Scotland and England. âIf that pattern continues, it is important to say to everybody here today, we will not be immune from it here in Wales. âAlready we have identified 97 cases in Wales and there will be more. ""Of those we know about, everyone has been tested, advised to isolate and their contacts traced. âThis includes a large cluster of cases in Conwy in north Wales, which is under close investigation,"" he said. The variant, first detected in India, has been given the name Delta by the World Health Organization. First Minister Mark Drakeford says coronavirus rates in Wales continue to be âvery lowâ. Mr Drakeford told the press conference: âIn Wales today, the seven-day case rate continues to be very low at fewer than 10 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is also below 1%.â He said he was glad to be able to confirm that there have been no new deaths recorded by Public Health Wales in the past nine days. And he also said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus was at the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. First Minister Mark Drakeford is starting today's briefing. We'll tell you what he says here, along with reaction to the changes announced for Monday. You can watch by following the link at the top of this page. This map shows the latest Covid case rates for each local council area. A total of 2,169,624 people have received a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Wales. That's 69% of the overall population. The full course of two doses has now been given to 1,181,259 people - or 37% of the population - according to Public Health Wales. No deaths with coronavirus have now been reported in Wales for the past nine days. Public Health Wales figures show 71 new cases reported. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The crush happened at the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground Two police forces are to pay damages to more than 600 people over a cover-up which followed the Hillsborough disaster. The South Yorkshire and West Midlands forces agreed the settlement earlier this year following a civil claim. Nobody has ever been convicted over police actions following the disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans died in a crush at a 1989 FA Cup semi-final. South Yorkshire Police offered an ""unreserved apology"" to those affected. Acting Chief Constable Lauren Poultney said the force acknowledged that ""serious errors and mistakes were made"" by its officers ""both on 15 April 1989 and during the subsequent investigations"". ""Those actions on the day of the disaster tragically led to lives being lost and many being injured [while] the force's subsequent failings also caused huge distress, suffering and pain, both to the victims and their families,"" she added. Details of the claim were revealed after former Ch Supt Donald Denton, 83, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster, 74, and Peter Metcalf, 71, who acted as a solicitor for the force,were acquitted of perverting the course of justicein May. The men were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on the force in the aftermath of the disaster by amending police statements. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the disaster on 15 April 1989 A spokesman for Saunders Law, the lead solicitors for the group litigation, said the civil claim for misfeasance in a public office was started in 2015. It was agreed in April but could not be reported until the conclusion of the trial. While compensation for the 96 victims will go to their bereaved families, damages will also be paid to survivors for the injuries they have suffered and access to a fund for further psychiatric treatment or counselling. The exact amount of compensation has yet to be agreed. Why the Hillsborough prosecutions collapsed Hillsborough: Remembering the 96 victims Timeline of the Hillsborough stadium disaster ""The settlement of these claims marks the end of an unparalleled and extraordinary fight for justice by the victims and their families,"" the Saunders spokesman said. ""We trust that this settlement will put an end to any fresh attempts to rewrite the record and wrongly claim that there was no cover-up."" He said there had been ""an almost complete failure of the justice system to deliver justice"" and called on the governmentto implement a Hillsborough Law,which would include a duty of candour for public officials. The criminal trial of two police officers and a solicitor collapsed because of a fundamental and very unusual legal barrier to it continuing - but claims for damages in civil law work differently. The families had to show on a balance of probabilities that there had been a cover-up - and the evidence was massively in their favour. In 2012 the Independent Panel detailed how the fans were unjustly blamed. The then-South Yorkshire Police chief constable accepted its findings - and then Prime Minister David Camerontold MPs the families had been right all along.,external In short, there was no point in police chiefs fighting a case that would, in all certainty, result in a damning verdict that their institutions had acted improperly. Attention now turns to Parliament. Families want the law to compel public bodies to tell the whole truth in all circumstances. They want guarantees of proper funding so they, like agencies of the state, can have the best lawyers in the land fighting their corner. The proposed Hillsborough Law had cross-party backing until the 2017 General Election stopped it. This government has the choice whether to bring it back. Louise Brookes, who was 17 when her brother Andrew died in the disaster, described the situation as ""shameful"". ""Why they couldn't have just admitted everything 32 years ago and we could have all moved on with our lives,"" she said. ""I have sacrificed 32 years of my life. We've done absolutely nothing wrong. ""How they could put us and the survivors through 32 years of hell?"" Louise Brookes was 17 when her brother Andrew died in the disaster The disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, which was later investigated by West Midlands Police, remains the UK's worst sporting disaster. Many families and survivors have since led a campaign for more than 30 years to discover how and why the victims died. In 2012, then-chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton apologised for a cover-up following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. New inquests, which concluded in 2016, found thatthe men, women and children who died were unlawfully killedand fans played no part in the causes of the disaster. Hillsborough campaigner Prof Phil Scraton said: ""You hear outside of Liverpool people saying 'why are they still going on about it?' ""And to put it into context, 96 men, women and children died at a football match and this has been the most costly, the longest and most complex legal process in British history. ""There's never been anything like it before."" Flowers and tributes were left at the Hillsborough Memorial after the collapse of the recent trial Acting Chief Constable Poultney has since offered ""an unreserved apology to those affected by the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath"" and said the actions of officers on the day of the disaster and afterwards was ""something South Yorkshire Police profoundly regrets"". West Midlands Police Deputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine added: ""We deeply regret the harm and distress caused to those affected by the tragedy. ""Although I know it cannot make up for their suffering, working with South Yorkshire Police we have agreed a scheme to compensate those affected."" She said she would like to thank the families ""for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves"".

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday. British Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes. The move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days. But travel firm Tui says50% of passengers due to travel there in Juneare still planning to go. Any travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than Â£540. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" he said. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" Speaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that ""tough"" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout.

'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' However, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the ""logic"" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. He also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: ""I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers."" It comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2. The latest figures show,externala further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported. No new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June. Labour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or ""at the very least"" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant. The travel industryhas criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces ""another lost summer"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not ""based on any science or public health"", and that  he did not understand why the UK ""which has been so successful with vaccines"" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine.

Now he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school. ""We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,"" he says. But with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal. The extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost Â£120 each, he says, adding Â£960 to the family's holiday bill. A week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says. ""No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,"" he says. ""Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign."" Portugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said. Some 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures. Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? 'Let us go on holiday and live our lives' Public Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. The number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks. On 2 June,Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. PHEbelieves the Delta variant is now dominant in the UKand that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. Earlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be ""60% more transmissible"" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha. Asked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing ""towards the direction of being cautious"".

"India has ordered 300 million doses of an unapproved coronavirus vaccine amid a devastating second wave. The unnamed vaccine from Indian firm Biological E is in Phase 3 trials, and had showed ""promising results"" in the first two phases, the federal government said in a statement. The $206m order is the first India has signed for a jab that has not received emergency approval. This comes as the country struggles to speed up its lagging vaccine drive. India has administered just over 220 million jabs so far, although much of its 1.4 billion population is now eligible for the vaccine. Less than 15% of the country has received at least one dose of the vaccination, largely because of a severe shortage of doses. Although Covid case numbers have been dropping, India is still adding more than 100,000 news cases a day. It has recorded more than 340,000 deaths from the virus so far, but experts say the number is vastly underestimated. India's federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been criticised for not placing huge orders ahead of time with either Indian or foreign vaccine makers. India has fully vaccinated fewer than 10% of its 1.4 billion people India is currently giving three vaccines - Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech and the government's Indian Council of Medical Research, and Sputnik V, which is developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute. Compared to the single order from Biological E for 300 million doses, India brought about 350 million doses from both Covishield and Covaxin between January and May. India's drug regulator gave Covaxin emergency approval in January before trials were completed - data on its efficacy is yet to be released. The new vaccine from Biological E is ""likely to be available in the next few months,"" according to the government. How India's vaccine drive went horribly wrong What we know about India's Covid-19 vaccines Pregnant, unprotected and living in fear of Covid Can India get all adults vaccinated this year? Why did India rush to approve a homegrown vaccine? Mr Modi's government is racing to shore up its vaccine stocks as Covid numbers dip, hoping to be well-prepared for what experts say is an inevitable third wave. India's vaccine drive, which had a promising start in January, began to slow down because vaccine hesitancy crept in as cases dropped. But numbers soon rose again in a deadly second wave that saw hospitals falling short of beds and crematoriums running short of space. Hoping to stem the tide, the government threw open the drive in May to everyone above the age of 18 but India's two vaccine makers - Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech - could not guarantee supply at that scale. But shortages persist and have also led to vast inequalities in access with rural areas, the poor and women falling behind in the line for jabs.

"The statue of slave trader Edward Colston is on public display in Bristol, almost exactly a year since it was toppled A statue of slave trader Edward Colston that was toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol has been placed on display. The bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant was thrown into the harbour on 7 June in the wake ofGeorge Floyd's murderin Minneapolis. The statue is on display at the M Shed museum in the city alongside placards from the protest. Residents have been invited to take part in a survey to decide its future. This video can not be played Why one African American wants to find out whether he shares more than a name with slaver Edward Colston TheWe Are Bristol History Commission,externalis leading the public consultation to decide its long-term future. Dr Shawn Sobers, associate professor at the University of the West of England and part of the commission, said the effects of the statue being pulled down ""ricocheted"" across the UK and the world. ""We know this isn't an isolated incident, we know that there are statues across the world that celebrate slavers,"" he said. ""At the same time, the anti-racist movement isn't about statues. It's trying to eradicate racism from society and bring equality where there's racial disparity which cuts across economic divides. ""But statues are a symbol of how seriously our cities in Britain are actually taking these issues."" Fran Coles worked to stabilise spray paint from the statue once it was recovered from the harbour Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said the future of the statue must be decided by the people of the city Dr Sobers described putting the Colston statue on display as an opportunity to tell a ""wider history"" and encourage people to speak about it. ""We're using this opportunity to find out what local people think because we have to live in this city together,"" he added. Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said: ""The future of the statue must be decided by the people of Bristol and so I urge everyone to take the opportunity to share their views."" Prof Tim Cole, chair of the commission, said: ""The display is not a comprehensive exhibition about Colston or transatlantic slavery in Bristol, but it is intended to be a departure point for continuing conversations about our shared history.""

"This video can not be played Covid: Social distancing to stay as 'personal repertoire' Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said it remained one of the ""strongest defences"" against Covid. The warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing. Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. But, Mr Drakeford said he was ""not certain there is a huge thirst"" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule. ""I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,"" he told a coronavirus press briefing. ""Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" Allowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased. The decision to delay comes amid ""growing concern"" overthe Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated. There are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? Welsh government signals return of sports fans Mr Drakeford said: ""The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle. ""This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults."" However, he added: ""We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales. ""That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant."" The lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June. The changes - described as a phased move toWales' alert level one,external- will begin from Monday. It means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time. A further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households. Further rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when anending to restrictions in Englandmay happen. Call for pub rules to be lifted Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Pubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has calledfor all significant restrictions to be liftedbefore July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule. WeMakeEvents organised protests and campaigns to help support the arts Sarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was ""great news"" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns. In recent weeks aseries of test eventshave been held, including the Tafwyl andEid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators. Ms Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's ""cautious"" approach, the test events had been ""incredibly restrictive"" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing. She added: ""The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it. ""But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work."" Up to 4,000 standing can attend outdoor events in Wales from 7 June Annual events, such as Brecon Jazz andGreen Man Festival, were waiting to seeif they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September. ""There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,"" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. ""It's great to have live music back."" The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""There's Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that."" Plaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while ""the economic devastation of the pandemic remains."" Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the ""cautious"" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were ""exhausted"". She also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits. Despite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to thatdemanded last year. ""I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe."" Wales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%. Figures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales. The case rate in Walesis currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days. A cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible fora spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23. There have been no new deaths with covid reported in Walesfor the past nine days. RUGBY - THE COST OF CONCUSSION:Have opportunities to protect players from brain injuries been missed?

The letter says decisions at the summit ""will define the 21st century"", and called on Johnson and other G7 leaders to ""rise to this challenge and end this crisis for good"". The UK says it has no surplus supplies to share at the moment, but will donate doses when it does. But Unicef says the UK and the other G7 countries could share 20% of their supplies in the next three months without impacting their own domestic rollouts. Read more on the issue here. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst In
the last 24 hours, mainland China has confirmed nine new symptomatic cases of
Covid-19 in southern Guangdong. This is the only area where the country
currently has an outbreak, and 113 people are in hospital. China
reacts swiftly as soon as single-digit cases of the virus are identified, and
so currently, communities in two cities have local lockdown measures in place:
Guangzhou and Foshan. However, in the last 24 hours, national media have
reported that mutant virus strains of the virus have been identified in
Guangzhou. An extra 140,000 peoplehave been ordered into lockdown,external,
and a mass testing drivewill take place in parts of the city between now and Sunday,external. China
has been lauding uptake of the vaccine in the country at helping prevent wider
transmission. Yesterday,the Global Times newspaper reported,externalthat patients in
Guangdong have largely exhibited little or no symptoms due to having already
had at least one vaccine dose. To
date, more than 723 million vaccine doses have been administered in China, more
than any other country in the world. As China is currently averaging around 20
million doses a day, tomorrowâs stats may be on par with the entire population
of Europe. China
has aims of vaccinating 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June, and is
hoping to reopen to the world in the first half of 2022. 723 million doses
equates to around 51% of Chinaâs population, but this figure includes second
doses. In Zimbabwe, vaccination centres in the capital Harare and second-largest city Bulawayo have been running out of doses - but ministers are urging people, ""please don't panic"". ""The doses are there, they are not in the large numbers that we would like but then that is the challenge that the whole world is facing,"" Agnes Mahomva, the government's Covid-19 response coordinator, said today. She added that Zimbabwe would take another shipment of vaccines ""any minute now"" without saying from where. Zimbabwe has so far shunned Western vaccines, preferring to
use those from China, India and Russia. Meanwhile, the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme says it hopes to send millions of delayed doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine to African countries this month and next. But UN officials say they're depending on a Spanish manufacturing site securing regulatory approval. Asked if any of the coronavirus variants could affect the further plans for restrictions easing in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says: ""We are looking out for these variants all the time. ""New variants do come through all the time - we're always careful and looking for that. ""However, thus far we've been able to open up steps one, two and three without an increase in the number of people going into hospital. That is essentially flat, and so we have been able to make this progress. ""The prime minister, at the start of the roadmap, said it was going to be cautious and irreversible - that is our goal."" He said the government was ""looking at the data all the way through"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Mr Berdimuhamedov holds the title âmaster of sportsâ in Turkmenistan The 2021 Track Cycling World Championships, scheduled to be
held in Turkmenistan in October,are to be moved to a new
venue, a blow to leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedovâs plans to bring a
prestige sporting event to his country. Governing body the UCI says the decision was taken ""at
the request of the organisers"" because ""health constraints and
restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic make it impossible to stage the
event in the country"". Turkmenistan has long held that it has no cases of the virus
within its borders, but diplomats and foreign media with contacts inside the
country say that this is not the case. Despite the claim of zero cases, citizens must wear
face masks, while restaurants and mosques were closed until April. The
explanation given was that âpathogensâ were blowing in from abroad, causing
pneumonia. The loss of the championships is embarrassing for
Turkmenistanâs autocratic leader, with the news coming on the same day he took
a symbolic cycle ride around the capital Ashgabat to mark World Bicycle Day. Mr Berdimuhamedov, known as ""Arkadag"" (Protector) to his
people, is often photographed flatteringly taking part in sporting events such
ascycling,
horse riding, and rally driving. But abroad, heâs criticised for his
disregard of human rights and mismanagement of the economy. With a tightly-controlled state media, itâs unlikely that
Turkmen citizens will hear much about this setback to Arkadagâs love of
prestige projects. Matt Hancock has defended the government's decision to remove Portugal from the coronavrius ""green"" travel list - a move that has prompted fury in the travel industry. He says after a rise in cases there, a ""safety first"" approach was needed. ""We are vigilant on international travel and we are very cautious,"" says the health secretary. ""There's a reason for that - and that is the risk of new variants that undermine the vaccine rollout programme is a really serious risk for this country."" Countries are only put on the green list when the government is ""highly confident"" it is safe to travel, he adds. The decision on Portugal had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India, he says. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" says Hancock. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" He says that fortunately the vaccine does work against that variant after two doses. But he warns that everyone has to ""remain vigilant"". ""My first job is to protect lives here at home and protect the opening up that we've managed to see over the past months,"" he adds. ""That does mean being very cautious on international travel.""

Outdoor service can resume from 7 June Vladimir Putin has said today that he's going to allow foreign citizens to get vaccinated in Russia for a fee. Speaking at Russia's annual economic conference in St Petersburg, Putin said he'd ordered officials to prepare the ground for vaccine tourism. There are four vaccines currently approved for domestic use in Russia, the most common of which is the Russian-produced Sputnik V. Putin also accused some countries of refusing to buy certain vaccines - such as Sputnik V - for ""politically motivated"" reasons. There has been a lot of talk today about a mutation of the Delta variant of Covid - the one first identified in India - which has been found in Nepal. Now Nepal's prime minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli says it is the UK's duty to provide vaccines for the country, given the political ties between the two - which includes the service of Nepali Gurkhas in the British Army. The country has been hit hard by the latest wave of Covid and there have been 4,000 deaths in the last month. With fewer than 3% of the population fully vaccinated, the countryâs prime minister asks Boris Johnson to send doses. The UK has sent ventilators and PPE, but Sharma Oli says it is vaccines he urgently needed. He says the country is looking to buy doses and warns it will be ""disastrous"" if Nepal does not get them. It comes as Nepalâs health ministry has refuted reports of a new variant  emerging in the country, saying the dominant strain is the Delta - Indian - variant. BBC South Asia correspondent Rajini Vaidyanathan says health officials are very angry at the reports coming out of the UK. Read more here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has welcomed the decision made by the independent regulator,which says that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective for children from the age of 12 upwards. As for next steps, he says: ""We will take clinical advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on how that should be taken forward, and then we will follow that clinical advice"". He says the UK has ""enough supply"" to vaccinate children, should that be advised. Hancock also says vaccinating children here would take priority over donating vaccine doses to other countries around the world. ""My first duty as health secretary for the UK is to make sure that the UK is protected and safe, and whilst thankfully children are very rarely badly affected by Covid themselves, they can still pass on the disease,"" he says. But he adds that he was working with his international counterparts to make sure people can get access to the vaccine around the world. He was speaking after a summit of G7 health ministers in Oxford. The daily figures also show that the number of people to have had one vaccine dose is now 39.9 million, while the number who have received both doses is 26.7 million. That's more than 75% of the adult population who have had one jab, and 50% who have had two jabs. The number of cases reported today, 6,238, is the highest figure reported since 25 March. The seven-day average for cases is up by 40%, amid concerns the Delta variant is fuelling a rise in infections. However, the seven-day average for deaths is down by 5.2% and hospitalisations are down by 2.2%. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter Anti-vaccine activist Kate

Simon Smith, who is currently in Portugal, says his family has been racing to find Covid tests to get a return flight to the UK on Saturday morning. The property developer from Stamford, Lincolnshire, who owns a villa in the Lagos area, says he has visited five medical centres and the main hospital to try and get his family tested. He says he was turned away from one centre after it ran out of testing kits. Mr Smith, who is abroad with his wife and two children, aged two and four, says: ""There were about 35 people in the queue, all British, and they told us, 'the first 15 are okay, but the rest of you might as well go home because we don't have enough tests'."" ""It's really safe here in Portugal,"" he adds. ""On the Algarve, there are very few cases, and all the restaurants and shops take it really seriously."" The family has been told the airport has a small amount of Covid tests available, so plan on turning up to their flight five hours early in the hopes of getting one. ""If we can't get that, we can't fly,"" he says. ""And then we are going to be stuck here, and then have to face ten days' quarantine. I have meetings on Friday, I can't afford ten days' quarantine, it is a joke."" More than 3,000 pages of private emails sent to and from US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci have been released. Dr Fauci, a National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism. The emails, dating from January to June 2020, offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans.

Sputnik V vaccine â the first Latin American country to do so. The vaccine, already exported globally, is reported to have
an efficacy of 91.6% after one dose. Test batches have been produced at the Richmond labs in
Pilar, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. In December, Argentina began
vaccinating with Sputnik V flown in from Russia. Confirmed deaths from Covid-19 have surged above 530 daily

"This video can not be played G7: 'I believe we can make significant progress' - Sunak A global agreement to end the ""race to the bottom"" on corporate taxation is within sight, according to the French and German finance ministers. France's Bruno le Maire told the BBC the G7 club of rich nations were ""just one millimetre away from a historic agreement"" on a global minimum rate. He urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. The German finance minister said a 15% rate would help pay back Covid debt Tax on big tech and multi-nationals has been a source of friction between the US and fellow G7 countries such as the UK. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said it was important to stop the world's biggest companies from dodging tax. He said it was ""absolutely necessary"" to reach a deal in order to ""get out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes todayâ¦especially after the Covid crisis and all the money we spent to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy."" French finance minister Bruno le Maire told the BBC any deal must include both a tech tax on digital activities as well as a minimum rate Mr Le Maire also urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get ""on board"". He added: ""European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough"". Both ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point. Mr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a ""starting point"". He said: ""If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%."" However, Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a ""turning point"" after years of going in the other direction. It came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he was ""confident"" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders. Finance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two day meeting which starts in London on Friday. Ahead of the G7 talks, starting in London on Friday, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system ""fit for the 21st Century"". In a letter to The Guardian,external, they wrote: ""Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it."" Those attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its ""historic nature"". Mr Scholz told me they'll ""have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation"". Another finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. The UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it. There are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording ""at least 15%"" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. The US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a ""non-starter"", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. The end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. This could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals. On Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms. However, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July. US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Mr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting. Speaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: ""Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners. ""I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend."" Governments have become increasingly concerned about the amount of tax paid by US tech giants. The ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues. The meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year,according to The Guardian,external. Microsoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP. Microsoft said this was  due to ""a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain"". ""Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" a spokesperson added. All G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world. Germany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is ""a promising start"" but said G7 nations must reach ""a common position on a new international tax system"" in London before more nations meet next month. They wrote,external: ""We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens."" The UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms. It is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook. The Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a ""floor"". Finance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

"Global food prices have jumped at their fastest monthly rate in over a decade, according to the United Nations. The UN uses a broad index of global food costs, which have also climbed for 12 months in a row. Suppliers have been affected by disruptions to production, labour and transport during the pandemic. Concerns are growing about broader inflation and how higher grocery bills will impact the world's economic recovery. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index tracks prices around the world of a range of food including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar. According to the index,,externalfood prices in May were 4.8% higher than April - the biggest monthly rise since October 2010 - and 39.7% higher than this time last year (May 2020). All five components of the index rose, led by the surging cost of vegetable oils, grain and sugar. That pushed the index up to its highest overall level since September 2011. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC Warnings inflation could breach 2% as prices rise The increased costs are a result of renewed demand in some countries and a backlog of low production. Market and supply disruptions due to restrictions on movement have created local shortages and higher prices. Experts had warned that high demand and low production would lead to rising inflation as economies exit lockdown. However, some industries could see a strong recovery. The FAO forecasts record global cereal production this year, which may help to ease upward price pressures. Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned UK consumers that they could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. As well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. A little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to increase wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. Most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. Read more here.

"The White House has defended the president's top coronavirus adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, amid scrutiny of his recently released work emails. Dr Fauci has been the face of the nation's Covid-19 response, drawing both praise and criticism. ""I'm very confident in Dr Fauci,"" President Joe Biden said on Friday. But emails have raised questions on whether he backed Chinese denials of the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a lab in Wuhan. A trove of Dr Fauci's emails covering the onset of the coronavirus outbreak were released this week to media under a freedom of information request. Why are people talking about Dr Fauci's emails? In one email sent last April, an executive at a health charity thanked Dr Fauci for publicly stating that scientific evidence does not support the lab-leak theory. In an interview with CNN, Dr Fauci said the email had been taken out of context by critics and he had an ""open mind"" about the origin of the virus. In his defence, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Dr Fauci had been an ""undeniable asset"". In a daily press briefing on Thursday, she said: ""The president and the administration feel that Dr Fauci has played an incredible role in getting the pandemic under control, being a voice to the public throughout the course of this pandemic."" Mr Biden reiterated his support after delivering remarks on Friday, when a reporter asked if he still had confidence in the infectious disease chief. There is no proof Covid-19 came from a lab, but Mr Biden has ordered a review into the matter that angered China, which has rejected the theory. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a lab in Wuhan, perhaps through an accidental leak. On Thursday, Dr Fauci maintained there was nothing untoward in an email exchange between himself and an executive from a medical non-profit organisation that helped fund research at a diseases institute in Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 was first reported. The NIH, which is a US public health agency, gave $600,000 (Â£425,000) to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from 2014-19 via a grant to the New York-based non-profit group EcoHealth Alliance, for the purpose of researching bat coronaviruses. Peter Daszak, head of EcoHealth Alliance, emailed Dr Fauci in April 2020, praising him as ""brave"" for seeking to debunk the lab leak theory. ""Many thanks for your kind note,"" Dr Fauci replied. This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci: Herd immunity is an ""elusive concept"" Dr Fauci told CNN on Thursday it was ""nonsense"" to infer from the email any cosy relationship between himself and the figures behind the Wuhan lab research. ""You can misconstrue it however you want,"" he said, ""that email was from a person to me saying 'thank you' for whatever it is he thought I said, and I said that I think the most likely origin is a jumping of species. I still do think it is, at the same time as I'm keeping an open mind that it might be a lab leak."" He added: ""The idea I think is quite farfetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill themselves as well as other people. I think that's a bit far out."" The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Allies of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) infectious disease specialist say Dr Fauci's messages show nothing more than a dedicated public servant navigating the early days of a once-in-a-century pandemic. But conservative critics are suggesting Dr Fauci may have engaged in a cover-up, and even claim he perjured himself in testimony to Congress. According to an investigation in Vanity Fair magazine,externalpublished on Thursday, Department of State officials discussed the origins of coronavirus at a meeting on 9 December 2020. They were told not to explore claims about gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan lab to avoid attracting unwelcome attention to US government funding of such research, reports Vanity Fair. Gain-of-function studies involve altering pathogens to make them more transmissible in order to learn more about how they might mutate. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that three employees at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill and were admitted to hospital in November 2019, just before the first reported Covid-19 cases. Days later, President Biden instructed US spy agencies to conduct a 90-day review into whether the virus could have emerged from a Chinese lab. His administration had previously deferred to the World Health Organization for answers on how the pandemic began. Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously ""I would like to see the medical records of the three people who are reported to have got sick in 2019,"" Dr Faucitold the Financial Times,externalon Thursday. ""Did they really get sick, and if so, what did they get sick with?"" He called on China to also release the medical records of six miners who fell ill after entering a bat cave in 2012 in China's Yunnan province. Three miners died, and Chinese researchers later visited the cave to take samples from the bats. ""It is entirely conceivable that the origins of Sars-Cov-2 was in that cave and either started spreading naturally or went through the lab,"" he said. Dr Robert Redfield, who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Trump administration, told Vanity Fair that he received death threats from fellow scientists when he backed the Wuhan lab leak theory last spring. ""I was threatened and ostracised because I proposed another hypothesis,"" Dr Redfield said. ""I expected it from politicians. I didn't expect it from science."" During congressional testimony on 12 May, Dr Fauci emphatically denied the US had ever funded controversial gain of function research at the Wuhan lab. During a subsequent Senate hearing on 26 May, Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked how Dr Fauci could be sure that Wuhan scientists did not use the money for gain-of-function research. ""You never know,"" Dr Fauci conceded, while adding that he believed the Chinese researchers were ""trustworthy"". Former President Donald Trump - widely vilified last year when he raised the possibility that Covid-19 came from the Wuhan lab - said on Thursday that Dr Fauci had a lot of questions to answer. ""What did Dr Fauci know about 'gain of function' research, and when did he know it?"" Mr Trump wrote in a statement. He added: ""China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!"" The same day, House of Representatives deputy Republican leader Steve Scalise demanded in a letter that Dr Fauci testify before Congress on the ""US government's role in funding research that may have contributed to the development of the novel coronavirus"". China's foreign ministry last week dismissed the Wuhan lab leak theory as ""extremely impossible"". Covid-19 is known to have infected some 172 million people, killing more than 3.5 million.

"Jobs vacancies in the UK are soaring but there are not enough workers to fill them, a report suggests. The easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of various sectors meant demand for workers rose at its fastest rate in May for more than 23 years, according to a KPMG survey. But the number of staff available to fill those jobs declined at the quickest rate since 2017. KPMG called on the government and firms to address skills gaps. Workers were especially needed in IT and computing, which has been a long-term trend, as well as hospitality, the survey found. Hospitality venues arestruggling to fill thousands of job vacancieswith waiting staff and chefs in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease, industry body UK Hospitality said last week. Many hospitality firms have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, including rates holidays and the furlough scheme, and staff have lost their jobs or seen their hours reduced. The retail industry saw the least demand for workers. Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers This monthly survey is based on responses from 400 recruitment and employment agencies and is yet more evidence of the economic recovery gathering pace. It says hiring activity has intensified across all job categories, particularly in IT and computing and hotels and catering. But there's also a shortage of workers. Hospitality and events firms have been struggling to get the staff they need to cope with a post-lockdown surge in demand. Some are warning of a staffing crisis this summer, partly caused by gaps left by EU workers who have returned home because of Brexit and the pandemic. The survey's authors say skills and labour shortages, that already existed before the pandemic, are now the most pressing issue in the jobs market. This means many employers will need to look at the wages and benefits they offer at a time when they're still struggling to financially recover from the last 14 months. The jobs market ""seems to be firing on all cylinders"" said KPMG partner Claire Warnes. ""But the deterioration in staff supply intensified this month... This is a worrying trend,"" she added. She called for government and firms to ""urgently address the skills gap"". Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC), said: ""With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus - and Covid has only made them worse. ""This is the most pressing issue in the jobs market right now, and has the potential to slow down the recovery."" A government spokesperson said: ""Our multi-billion pound plan for jobs, including the Kickstart scheme, is supporting employers across the country to create jobs and help jobseekers get the skills and experience needed to develop their careers and fulfil roles for years to come. ""Additionally, we have increased the apprenticeship hiring incentive to Â£3,000 per new apprentice hire and our lifetime skills guarantee - worth the equivalent of around Â£3,400 per person - ensures all adults can gain new skills and qualifications.""

"Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday. British Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes. The move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days. But travel firm Tui says50% of passengers due to travel there in Juneare still planning to go. Any travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than Â£540. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India. ""It was not a decision I wanted to take,"" he said. ""But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas."" Speaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that ""tough"" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Covid infections rise by two-thirds in UK - ONS Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' However, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the ""logic"" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. He also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: ""I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers."" It comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2. The latest figures show,externala further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported. No new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June. Labour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or ""at the very least"" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant. The travel industryhas criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces ""another lost summer"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not ""based on any science or public health"", and that  he did not understand why the UK ""which has been so successful with vaccines"" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine.

Now he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school. ""We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,"" he says. But with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal. The extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost Â£120 each, he says, adding Â£960 to the family's holiday bill. A week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says. ""No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,"" he says. ""Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign."" Portugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said. Some 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures. Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? 'Let us go on holiday and live our lives' Public Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. The number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks. On 2 June,Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. PHEbelieves the Delta variant is now dominant in the UKand that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. Earlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be ""60% more transmissible"" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha. Asked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing ""towards the direction of being cautious"".

"Global food prices have jumped at their fastest monthly rate in over a decade, according to the United Nations. The UN uses a broad index of global food costs, which have also climbed for 12 months in a row. Suppliers have been affected by disruptions to production, labour and transport during the pandemic. Concerns are growing about broader inflation and how higher grocery bills will impact the world's economic recovery. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index tracks prices around the world of a range of food including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar. According to the index,,externalfood prices in May were 4.8% higher than April - the biggest monthly rise since October 2010 - and 39.7% higher than this time last year (May 2020). All five components of the index rose, led by the surging cost of vegetable oils, grain and sugar. That pushed the index up to its highest overall level since September 2011. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC Warnings inflation could breach 2% as prices rise The increased costs are a result of renewed demand in some countries and a backlog of low production. Market and supply disruptions due to restrictions on movement have created local shortages and higher prices. Experts had warned that high demand and low production would lead to rising inflation as economies exit lockdown. However, some industries could see a strong recovery. The FAO forecasts record global cereal production this year, which may help to ease upward price pressures. Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned UK consumers that they could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. As well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. A little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to increase wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. Most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. Read more here.

"India has ordered 300 million doses of an unapproved coronavirus vaccine amid a devastating second wave. The unnamed vaccine from Indian firm Biological E is in Phase 3 trials, and had showed ""promising results"" in the first two phases, the federal government said in a statement. The $206m order is the first India has signed for a jab that has not received emergency approval. This comes as the country struggles to speed up its lagging vaccine drive. India has administered just over 220 million jabs so far, although much of its 1.4 billion population is now eligible for the vaccine. Less than 15% of the country has received at least one dose of the vaccination, largely because of a severe shortage of doses. Although Covid case numbers have been dropping, India is still adding more than 100,000 news cases a day. It has recorded more than 340,000 deaths from the virus so far, but experts say the number is vastly underestimated. India's federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been criticised for not placing huge orders ahead of time with either Indian or foreign vaccine makers. India has fully vaccinated fewer than 10% of its 1.4 billion people India is currently giving three vaccines - Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech and the government's Indian Council of Medical Research, and Sputnik V, which is developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute. Compared to the single order from Biological E for 300 million doses, India brought about 350 million doses from both Covishield and Covaxin between January and May. India's drug regulator gave Covaxin emergency approval in January before trials were completed - data on its efficacy is yet to be released. The new vaccine from Biological E is ""likely to be available in the next few months,"" according to the government. How India's vaccine drive went horribly wrong What we know about India's Covid-19 vaccines Pregnant, unprotected and living in fear of Covid Can India get all adults vaccinated this year? Why did India rush to approve a homegrown vaccine? Mr Modi's government is racing to shore up its vaccine stocks as Covid numbers dip, hoping to be well-prepared for what experts say is an inevitable third wave. India's vaccine drive, which had a promising start in January, began to slow down because vaccine hesitancy crept in as cases dropped. But numbers soon rose again in a deadly second wave that saw hospitals falling short of beds and crematoriums running short of space. Hoping to stem the tide, the government threw open the drive in May to everyone above the age of 18 but India's two vaccine makers - Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech - could not guarantee supply at that scale. But shortages persist and have also led to vast inequalities in access with rural areas, the poor and women falling behind in the line for jabs.

"Portugal will be removed from the UK's green travel list from Tuesday, amid rising coronavirus cases and concern over a ""Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant"". It will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and returnees must isolate for 10 days. Seven nations - including Egypt, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka - will join the red list, with the toughest travel rules. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move was a ""safety-first approach"". Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors, so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? More than half of UK adults fully vaccinated The red list will expand to include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago. People arriving in the UK from these destinations will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days at a fixed cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The changes come into effect at 04:00 BST on Tuesday. No new countries will be added to the green list, Mr Shapps said. The removal of Portugal means the green list will, from Tuesday, consist of: Australia, Brunei, the Falkland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The transport secretary said two factors had led to the decision to downgrade Portugal, along with the islands of Madeira and the Azores. ""One is the positivity rate has nearly doubled since the last review in Portugal,"" he said. ""And the other is there's a sort of Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant [now known as Delta] which has been detected and we just don't know the potential for that to be a vaccine-defeating mutation."" On the so-called ""Nepal mutation"", Public Health England told the BBC it was ""aware of reports linking Nepal to Delta (VOC-21APR-02) with the additional mutation K417N"". ""This variant is present in multiple countries including a small number of cases in the UK, detected through rapid testing and whole genome sequencing,"" PHE said. ""We are investigating K417N to better understand its significance."" On 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. Kerry says the prospect of a holiday was a ray of hope after a ""year of hell"" Kerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had ""the year from hell"". Her partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic. She was just about to book a trip to Portugal when the rules changed. ""This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet,"" she says. But others say they are likely to make the trip anyway. One man told the BBC: ""Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine."" Read more travellers' reactions Labour said downgrading Portugal was ""not the answer"" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether. The travel and tourism industry also voiced dismay, as shares fell in airlines and travel companies after the BBC first reported plans to lower Portugal's rating. EasyJet's chief executive accused the government of having ""torn up its own rule book"", saying the decision ""essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world"". The chief executive of Heathrow Airport said: ""Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later."" The debate over travel rules comes after it was announced that more than half of the UK's adult population has now been vaccinated. A total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago. Meanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test.
