"The new prime minister has lamented that the UK falls far behind Spain in terms of the number of homes with access to full-fibre internet The UK's telecoms industry has issued the prime minister a challenge of its own after Boris Johnson said he wanted full-fibre broadband ""for all"" by 2025. An open letter says the target,externalis possible, but only if the government tackles four problems causing delays. It adds that all of the issues must be resolved ""within the next 12 months"" to achieve the high-speed internet goal. But one expert said at least one of the measures was unachievable in that time frame. Mr Johnson originally declared his desire to deliver the 100% rollout of fibre-optic broadband to properties across the UK ""in five years at the outside""in an article for the Telegraph published before,externalhe won the leadership vote. In it, he described the government's former target of 2033 as being ""laughably unambitious"". The letter sent to 10 Downing Street lists four policies that the industry says require urgent attention: Planning reform - at present telecom providers need to get a type of permission known as a ""wayleave agreement"" to get access to land and buildings to install cables. But in many cases property owners are unresponsive. The industry wants ministers to force landlords to provide access if a tenant has requested a full-fibre or other connection be installed Fibre tax - the so-called tax refers to the fact that fibre infrastructure currently has business rates applied to it, just like other commercial property. The industry claims this discourages investment and should be rethought New builds - the government has carried out a consultation into whether new-build home developments must incorporate gigabit-capable internet connections, but has yet to publish its response. In the meantime, the industry says too many new homes are still being developed without provision for fibre broadband Skills - a large number of engineers will be required to carry out all the work involved. BT and Virgin Media have previously warned that Brexit could result in labour shortages. The industry says more money must be committed to training, and it must also be allowed to continue to ""compete for global talent"" ""Nationwide full fibre coverage is not a can that can be kicked down the road,"" the letter concludes. ""Work needs to start now, and 100% fibre coverage requires a 100% commitment from government."" The letter has been signed by the chair of theInternet Services Providers Association,external, the interim chief executive of theFederation of Communication Services,externaland the chief executive of theIndependent Networks Co-operative Association,external. Their members include BT, Openreach, Sky, Gigaclear, CityFibre, Hyperoptic, Virgin Media, Google and Vodafone among many others. Openreach, which maintains the UK's digital network infrastructure, said it welcomed the government's ambition but warned: ""Upgrading the entire UK network is a major civil engineering challenge."" It urged the government to ""boost the build"" by ""creating an environment that encourages greater investment"". Number 10 referred the BBC to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport for comment. Installing fibre connections to every home involves disruption, cost and a lot of work ""We are pleased industry shares our ambition to turbo-charge the economy by delivering world-class, gigabit-capable broadband across the country as soon as possible,"" a DCMS spokesman said. ""The government is committed to creating the right opportunities for investment and speeding up the rollout of the required digital infrastructure."" He declined to comment specifically on the four demands, but indicated that a more detailed response would be given later. One industry-watcher noted that the Scottish government had already pledged 100% tax relief to companies that install fibre broadband in Scotland, and suggested a similar reform would address the fibre tax request. But she added that it would be almost impossible for ministers to resolve the access issue by the next summer. ""That is going to require a very carefully worded piece of legislation that takes into account business owners, property owners, landowners, as well as the telecommunications and service providers,"" explained Fiona Vanier from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""It's going to be a difficult piece of legislation to draw up. ""And there's just recently been a change in Prime Minister, the majority is very slim, and they have things to be getting on with the [Brexit] deadline at the end of October."" Full-fibre broadband, fibre to the premises - the terms may leave you scratching your head especially if you already thought you had a fast connection and you were pretty sure that it went all the way into your house. But the reality is that only about 7% of UK properties have full-fibre optic cables running all the way from the green cabinet on the street to their front doors. There are actually three main types of broadband connections. ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) involves a situation where both the link between the telephone exchange and the street cabinet, and the onward connection to the property are achieved via copper phone cables. Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) achieves higher speeds by giving the roadside cabinet its own fibre link. And Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) addresses the final part of the connection - which is often referred to as the ""last mile"". Under this system, properties can be directly connected to the exchange without passing through a street cabinet, But intermediary boxes - often hidden from view - where fibre links are ""split"" to serve individual buildings may still be used. Fibre transmits more bits of data per second by sending pulses of light along optical cables made of glass or plastic. While FTTC offers users average speeds of around 66 megabits per second, FTTP can offer average speeds of one gigabit per second today and potentially terabits per second in the future. So, we would benefit from a full-fibre diet, but making it happen as quickly as the prime minister has in mind could be hard to achieve. The UK ranks far behind some other European nations including Latvia, Lithuania and Spain where roughly half of all homes have access to FTTP connections,according to an industry study,external. But while the technology offers a degree of future-proofing, some internet chiefs have suggested it would be more cost-effective to fall back on other solutions in the medium-term. Virgin says that copper-based connections can be used to deliver fast enough speeds for the coming years Last month, Virgin Media said that it would soon be able to provide gigabit download speeds over copper-based coaxial cables, meaning households could benefit from faster, more reliable connections without having to dig up streets and paths to lay new fibre. O2's chief executive also recently told the BBC that the Prime Minister would be wiser to fall back on 5G for sparsely populated parts of the UK. ""At what level does it become uneconomic to [provide fibre] versus mobile?"" Mark Evans asked. ""I would suggest that isn't at 100% fibre connectivity because, for example, the Scottish farmer that lives remotely - we can reach that person, give them the bandwidth, give them a 5G experience - it's much cheaper than digging the fibre connectivity to that home. That's just nonsensical. ""So I applaud him on his desire to improve fibre connectivity in the UK - but I do think there's a level that he needs to weigh up as to which type of technology meets the need.""

"This video can not be played Willenhall Holiday Inn has been 'almost completely destroyed' in a fire A Holiday Inn has been ravaged by fire that tore through hotel rooms and sent up smoke that could be seen from miles around. The building has been almost completely destroyed, according to one emergency crew. More than 50 firefighters fought the ""severe"" blaze at the hotel in Walsall close to the M6 motorway. The fire is believed to have started in the sauna at the site on Wolverhampton Road West in Willenhall at 15:50 BST. Neil Griffiths, incident commander at the scene, said the blaze caused ""devastation"". He said: ""We want to restore everything back to normality, find out what the cause of the fire is... and we are going to be here for a considerable amount of time due to the size of the building. ""The smoke shouldn't affect any of the surrounding houses but it would be advisable, if you're in the vicinity, to keep your windows and doors shut for the rest of the evening."" The hotel says all staff and guests are accounted for Hotel staff evacuated the two-storey building and carried out a roll call, according to West Midlands Fire Service. A Holiday Inn spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that our guests and employees have been accounted for and no-one has been injured."" Intense flames could be seen at the building's windows Footage shared by emergency services shows burnt-out sections of the roof and fierce flames. This video can not be played Firefighters tackle blaze at Willenhall Holiday Inn Crews informed Highways England of the fire due to a large amount of smoke close to junction 10 of the M6.

"The number of tourists visiting the UK from China has risen by almost a fifth this summer, the latest figures show. Travel data firm ForwardKeys said that summer flight bookings from long-haul markets were also 6% higher than in the same period last year. It credited the weakness of the pound for boosting tourists' spending power. This week sterling hit a 31-month low against the dollar amid increasing speculation the UK could leave the EU without a deal. ""This summer is likely to see the highest number of Chinese tourists to the UK ever,"" said ForwardKeys spokesman David Tarsh. Why the pound is getting weaker Five holiday destinations where a weak pound still goes far He added that the number of Indian tourists was ahead by 20%, with Japan at 10% and the USA at 5%. Sarah Hewin, chief economist for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered, said the low pound meant visitors would be feeling wealthier. ""The fall in the value of the pound against China's currency [the renminbi] means that Chinese tourists coming to the UK have seen their spending power increase by around 5% in the past three months."" This tallies with what Patricia Yates, a director at the UK's tourism promotion agency Visit Britain, is seeing on the ground. ""The UK is offering great value for inbound visitors right now which gives us a valuable opportunity including in Europe, where we are already running a campaign to promote travel to the UK during the summer."" Diane Howarth and her husband Andrew Staycations are also boosting the industry. The regional tourist office Welcome to Yorkshire finds that tourism is thriving in the area. Commercial director Peter Dodd said: ""We're hearing from lots of our accommodation members, especially cottages, lodges and other self-catering properties, that business is booming with some already fully booked until October."" One of those is Diane Howarth who runs the holiday letting company Cottage in the Dales and is having a record year. ""We're at 87% occupancy for the year already, which is much earlier than in previous years. Brexit uncertainty is causing people to choose holidays in Britain this year, which is good news for us."" But when it comes to European visitors, Visit Britain says there is some concern about the impact that the uncertainty of Brexit is having. The latest ONS tourism stats showed that visits from Europe to the UK were relatively flat from January to March this year -  up just 2% compared to the same period last year. They are running a campaign in Europe to persuade people that the UK will still be a good place to visit after it leaves the European Union. However anecdotally, some businesses like Mrs Howarth's Cottage in the Dales are seeing seeing a rise in EU visitors. ""We're getting repeat bookings from fans of the Tour de Yorkshire race, but also seeing new interest from people in the Netherlands and Germany for example, who are taking advantage of the weaker pound to come and visit this beautiful part of the world in person"" Why has the pound tumbled?

"US rapper ASAP Rocky has temporarily been released from custody in Sweden. The 30-year-old, real name Rakim Mayers, will be freed until a judge returns a verdict in the assault trial on 14 August. He and two of his entourage have pleaded not guilty to assaulting a 19-year-old man in Stockholm in June. Over the past week, a court has heard evidence and testimonies about the brawl, which led to ASAP Rocky's detention in the country. Allow Instagram content?

The rapper says he, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers were acting in self-defence in fighting that broke out near the Max Burger chain on 30 June, after two men allegedly refused to stop following his entourage. But in court on Friday, the prosecution said ASAP Rocky and his companions had ""every possibility"" to leave the scene and that they were not in a position where they needed to use ""self-defence"". During his summing up, prosecutor Daniel Suneson told the Stockholm District Court the rapper should be jailed for about six months. ASAP Rocky's defence lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, argued the incident was not a pre-meditated group assault and the rapper should be set free. ASAP Rocky (back right) smiled widely as he left the district court The Swedish judge, Per Lennerbrant, said the performer and his two co-accused could be released from custody and were free to leave the country ahead of his verdict. Such a ruling may point to an acquittal, or a sentence of less than the time already served, Reuters reported. Mr Jovicic said his client ""is a free person for now"" but has a ""nervous wait for two more weeks"". The case has made waves internationally, with an online petition for the rapper's release garnering more than 640,000 signatures. US President Donald Trump was among those to back a #JusticeForRocky campaign that attracted the support of celebrities such as Kanye West and Justin Bieber. The US president even sent his special envoy on hostage affairs - Robert O'Brien - to Sweden to attend the trial. On Friday, Mr Trump claimed ASAP Rocky was ""on his way home to the United States"" in a tweet posted shortly after the ruling to temporarily free the rapper. Mr O'Brien told reporters he had called the president to tell him the rapper ""would be back in America soon"", but did not elaborate on the timescale. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this week, ASAP Rocky said that he and his team had felt threatened by the people they clashed with and said he is not looking for money but wants justice and for his name to be cleared. Much of the trial has centred around analysing videos and whether bottles had been used as weapons during the alleged assault. The rapper did not deny he was holding a glass bottle in his hand - but says he picked it up briefly before putting it back down. The prosecution claimed a bottle was used in the fight, but the US star insisted he did not use it to hurt the alleged victim. On Friday, ASAP Rocky's bodyguard said the teenager had been ""harassing"" and ""following"" the group and ""swung"" at him prior to the brawl. After being released the rapper said it had been a ""difficult and humbling experience"" in a post on Insatgram. The court also heard from a psychologist, who told the court the alleged victim is not sleeping at night, has lost concentration, and is afraid. Fans of ASAP Rocky have been gathering at the court in Stockholm all week, shouting chants such as 'Free Rocky' Earlier this week, the prosecution went through a detailed 522-page preliminary report, which contained extensive photographs of injuries the alleged victim suffered. The man, who is not being named by media, has claimed damages of roughly Â£12,000 (139,700 Swedish Krona). During his evidence, he told the court he was looking for a friend and first approached the rapper and his entourage to ask ""if they knew where his mate was"". When asked by ASAP Rocky's lawyer if he knew the rapper was famous he said: ""Honestly not."" Injuries on the alleged victim's body - which prosecutors claim are consistent with use of a bottle Fans Arvin Flod and his friend Martyna Lechowska have turned up at the court in Stockholm Fans of the rapper have been gathering at court in Sweden in growing numbers over the week. Patrick, 16, says he wants to ""seek justice"" and thinks the rapper has ""lots of energy"" and ""good vibes"". He says the case could have a negative impact on Sweden in the future because he believes ""other rappers won't come and do gigs"". 20-year-old Arvin Flod says the case is the ""biggest thing in Sweden right now"", while his friend Martyna Lechowska, 20, doesn't think he should have ""locked in for such a long time"" already. If found guilty, the men on trial could face up to two years behind bars. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"This video can not be played Ashes: England's Rory Burns scores maiden Test century v Australia on day two at Edgbaston Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day two of five) Australia 284:Smith 144, Broad 5-86 England 267-4:Burns 125*, Root 57 England trail by 17 runs Scorecard Rory Burns' maiden Test century led a determined England batting effort on the second day of the first Ashes Test against Australia at Edgbaston. The left-handed opener, playing his eighth match, battled through an attritional day for 125 not out. With Joe Root making 57 in a second-wicket stand of 132 and Ben Stokes an unbeaten 38, England reached 267-4, trailing by 17. England had slices of luck. Burns was on 21 when he would have been lbw to Nathan Lyon had Australia opted to review, while Root survived a James Pattinson delivery hitting off stump but not dislodging the bails when he was on nine. Those incidents were characteristic of a day when Australia bowled well for little reward in front of another noisy crowd that celebrated every England run and basked in the warm evening sunshine. Only when they persuaded the umpires to change the ball did the tourists have a period of success, with Joe Denly and Jos Buttler falling in the space of four overs. But Stokes, given a hero's welcome after his performance in the World Cup final, joined Burns in an unbroken stand of 73 for the fifth wicket. It leaves England in a strong position, even if they are likely to need a healthy first-innings lead to negate the disadvantage of batting last on a pitch already offering sharp turn. 'I was ready to run through a brick wall' - Burns inspired by 2005 Ashes winners 'Burns finally cracks the curse of the England opener' Arthur in frame for England job Listen: TMS podcast - Burns batting something 'Alastair Cook would be proud of' This video can not be played Burns survives lbw appeal on 21 as Australia unwisely decide not to review Speaking before the series, England coach Trevor Bayliss said ""you do not have to be Einstein"" to deduce that an unreliable top order was their biggest obstacle to regaining the Ashes. In an unconvincing display against Ireland last week, when England were bowled out for 85 in the first innings, it was Burns who looked the most vulnerable. Here, though, the Surrey man was the mainstay of a collective England showing of old-fashioned batting values - patience, watchfulness and occupation of the crease. It meant that the action was much more sedate than the chaos of the opening day, but the home crowd were just as keen to sing for England and taunt the Australians. Like Thursday, umpiring errors were a feature, but more forgivable. It was a surprise when Burns was shown to be lbw to Lyon, the noise of ball hitting stump actually led to Root being given caught behind and a tiny inside edge was not detected when he was given leg before to Peter Siddle on 14. Both were overturned. On top of England's solid day with the bat, there was also the welcome sight of James Anderson running on the outfield, but there is still no news from the scan on his injured calf. This video can not be played Unbelievable! - Ball hits stumps but Root survives Following Australia's Steve Smith on day one, Burns became the second idiosyncratic centurion of the Test, with his leaning stance, glance to mid-wicket as the bowler runs in and bat that comes down from the direction of gully. After England resumed on 10-0, Jason Roy edged to first slip for 10, leaving Burns and Root to grind through the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon. Root scored only 11 from his first 60 balls, but gradually increased in fluency. Burns left well, scored mainly square of the wicket on both sides and had the fortune of a number of edges not going to hand. Just as England were gaining momentum, Root patted a drive back to Siddle that the bowler held one-handed, with Denly and Buttler following soon after. Burns continued the battle. He spent 37 minutes on 92 and 35 balls in the 90s before a single off Lyon - confirmed after he was shown to have beaten a direct hit to the non-striker's end - sparked an emotional celebration and chants of his name from the Hollies Stand. Together with Stokes, he repelled the second new ball to take England to the brink of parity. This video can not be played Watch Burns reach his maiden Test century Bar bowling a fraction too short in the morning and off-spinner Lyon occasionally drifting on to the pads of England's left-handers, Australia toiled honestly and without the rub of the green. How different might the day have been had the bails fallen when Pattinson got through Root to hit the off stump? On another occasion, one of Burns' edges could have found a slip fielder. They were at least boosted 58 overs into the day when they convinced the umpires that the ball had gone out of shape and were given a replacement that swung much more than the previous version. Pattinson immediately shaped one into Denly that pinned him leg before, while Cummins' away movement had Buttler edge to third slip. That, though, was the best it got for the visitors, who at one point gave an over to Matthew Wade, a wicketkeeper by trade. After an unsuccessful review against Burns, the day ended with Australia being subjected to a barrage of mock appeals from the Hollies. England v Australia - highlights & reaction This video can not be played 'A big breakthrough' - Roy out for 10 England's Rory Burns on BBC Test Match Special:""It is something I have dreamt of. I was on 99 for a while - to get over the line is awesome. I was calm throughout it. I was waiting for a ball to come into my area. ""It was one for the purists - hard work. I enjoy that. Getting in the battle and doing what you can is enough for me."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""Rory Burns has arrived here at Edgbaston. Mentally, he showed he is made of strong stuff. ""Alastair Cook would have been proud of that innings. There is no greater compliment for an England opening batsman. ""He was all over the shop against Ireland last week. His technique was not with him. He has gone away and worked with his coaches. He has got his hands tighter to his body and had a great game plan. To bat all day was fantastic. ""That was the best day of Test match batting I have seen from England in a long, long time."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England really should be looking to establish a sizable first-innings lead tomorrow - and they will need it."" Burns is the first England opener to bat through a day in a Test since Alastair Cook against Australia at Melbourne in 2017 Burns spent 54 minutes in the nineties He is the first opener to score a hundred in England other than Alastair Cook since Adam Lyth in 2015 England and Wales Cricket Board Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?

"The new hospital has faced a number of delays A health board is paying millions of pounds to a private consortium for a hospital it cannot use. The new children's hospital in Edinburgh was due to open in July, butlast-minute inspections found safety concernsover its ventilation systems. NHS Lothian has confirmed repayments for the hospital - the equivalent of about Â£1.4m a month - started when it took over the facility in February. It is not known when the hospital will be ready to open to patients. The new Sick Children's Hospital cost about Â£150m to build, but its full price tag over the next 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, will be Â£432m. Under the terms of the contract, repayments - which would average about Â£1.4m a month - began in February when NHS Lothian took possession of the site from private consortium IHSL. The deal with IHSL to design, build, finance and maintain the new hospital was under the Non-Profit Distributing (NPD) system, the Scottish government's version of controversial private financing models such as PFI. The existing hospital, in the Sciennes area of Edinburgh, remains open - but it has been sold to student housing firm Downing, and it is unclear when the developer wants to take possession of the site. Tom Waterson, chairman of Unison Scotland's health committee, said: ""To add to the serious health and safety concerns in this project, we now find out there is a serious financial penalty for this farce. ""Every penny is a prisoner in that health board just now and to find out we are paying millions of pounds for a hospital we can't use is nothing short of scandalous. ""We need a full independent public inquiry into what has gone wrong. It can't be left to the Scottish government because they are involved."" Last montha full safety review into the delayed Sick Children's Hospitalwas ordered by the Scottish government. It also announced private consultants KPMG had been hired to establish the factors which led to the delay. A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""The health secretary has been clear that her first priority is patient safety, and that all necessary actions are taken to allow the move to go ahead as quickly and safely as possible. ""In addition, the health secretary has confirmed that KPMG have been engaged to conduct an independent audit of the governance arrangements for the new hospital, and to provide an external and impartial assessment of the factors leading to the delay."" Other safety reviews will be made at other recently completed major NHS facilities across Scotland. This will include the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which was built by the same contractor and has also experienced problems with ventilation systems. The NHS-led review is due to be finished by September and unions fear it will be next year before the Edinburgh hospital is ready to be fully occupied. There are concerns over water, ventilation and drainage systems at the facility. The new hospital will provide care for children and young people Under the terms of the NPD contract, the design of the hospital had to be signed off by NHS Lothian before construction by IHSL got under way. It is thought the review will focus on whether the ventilation problem is down to the original design, or the implementation of the agreed design. An NHS Lothian spokeswoman said: ""The annual service payment started when the building was handed over to the board in February."" The health board has previously said that until checks are completed, and a timeline for the ventilation work is known, it is not possible to estimate when the 233-bed hospital could be fully occupied. However, a partial migration of services might be possible. A spokesman for the consortium that built the hospital said: ""Our works on the hospital were signed off as complete by the Independent Certifier on 22nd February 2019, when we handed over the building into the possession and operation of NHS Lothian. ""To the extent that any modifications to the building are now deemed necessary, we will provide such assistance to NHS Lothian as may be required.""

"The train came to a halt several hundred yards to the east of the station The Caledonian Sleeper train was stopped using an emergency brake after overshooting the platform at Edinburgh Waverley. The Northbound Lowlander service ended up several hundred yards to the east of the station after the incident on Thursday. Operator Serco confirmed the train's manager deployed the emergency brake. The company said its own investigation had revealed the incident was the result of an ""operational mistake"". An inspector from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch was sent to the scene to gather evidence. The train blocked a junction, halting trains to and from North Berwick, Dunbar, Tweedbank and London. The new Caledonian Sleeper cars have been operating on the route to Edinburgh TSSA union general secretary Manuel Cortes said: ""Clearly this is an incredibly serious situation which calls for nothing less than the grounding of the entire new Sleeper fleet until we have the full details of the what went wrong. ""No one should be playing fast and loose with faulty brakes on our railways and Serco need to wake up to that fact and act now."" Ryan Flaherty, Serco's managing director for Caledonian Sleeper, said: ""We are very proud of our train manager who followed the correct processes and deployed the emergency brake to bring the train to a stop during yesterday's incident at Edinburgh Waverley. ""Our own early investigation indicates there are no technical or safety concerns with the rolling stock and that this was an isolated operational mistake. ""Following the incident, our new trains ran as normal last night and will do so again this evening. ""We will continue to work with the relevant authorities to investigate the underlying cause and expect to provide an update next week."" A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) spokesman said: ""An RAIB inspector was deployed yesterday to gather evidence. We will use this information to decide any further course of action.""

"This video can not be played Willenhall Holiday Inn has been 'almost completely destroyed' in a fire A Holiday Inn has been ravaged by fire that tore through hotel rooms and sent up smoke that could be seen from miles around. The building has been almost completely destroyed, according to one emergency crew. More than 50 firefighters fought the ""severe"" blaze at the hotel in Walsall close to the M6 motorway. The fire is believed to have started in the sauna at the site on Wolverhampton Road West in Willenhall at 15:50 BST. Neil Griffiths, incident commander at the scene, said the blaze caused ""devastation"". He said: ""We want to restore everything back to normality, find out what the cause of the fire is... and we are going to be here for a considerable amount of time due to the size of the building. ""The smoke shouldn't affect any of the surrounding houses but it would be advisable, if you're in the vicinity, to keep your windows and doors shut for the rest of the evening."" The hotel says all staff and guests are accounted for Hotel staff evacuated the two-storey building and carried out a roll call, according to West Midlands Fire Service.

"Parts of the city of Salisbury were sealed off after the nerve agent attack in 2018 US President Donald Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK in March 2018. US banks are now banned from providing loans to Russia, and Washington will also be opposing any loan extension to Moscow by international institutions. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury, though they have now recovered. Russia denies any role in the attack. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the latest US move, Russia's Ria news agency reports. Mr Trump signed an executive order to impose the second set of sanctions on Thursday.,external The sanctions include opposing ""the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance... by international financial institutions"". The new measures would also ""prohibit any United States bank from making any loan or providing any credit... except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities or products"". President Putin (left) and President Trump last met during the G20 summit in Japan in June The sanctions were imposed under America's Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act adopted in 1991. The act mandates the imposition of new sanctions within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurance that it will no longer use chemical weapons. The first set of US sanctions against Russia was imposed last August. They covered exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that could have military applications. Restrictions were also placed on Russian access to US financial services. In recent months, the US Congress has been pressing President Trump to act again, saying that the 90-day deadline had long expired. The sanctions came a day after Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation. Both the White House and the Kremlin said the two leaders discussed massive wildfires raging in Russia. They did not say whether the sanctions issue was also raised. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were discovered unconscious on a bench in the UK city of Salisbury on 4 March. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the Novichok attack. The investigation also identified two suspects using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - both denied any involvement. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury Mr Skripal and his daughter recovered after intensive care in hospital, and their current whereabouts are being kept secret. Will Salisbury poison suspects face UK trial? What are nerve agents and what do they do? The attack prompted the UK and its Western allies to expel many Russian diplomats - and Russia retaliated with its own expulsions. Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate-general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital.

But in court on Friday, the prosecution said ASAP Rocky and his companions had ""every possibility"" to leave the scene and that they were not in a position where they needed to use ""self-defence"". During his summing up, prosecutor Daniel Suneson told the Stockholm District Court the rapper should be jailed for about six months. ASAP Rocky's defence lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, argued the incident was not a pre-meditated group assault and the rapper should be set free. ASAP Rocky (back right) smiled widely as he left the district court The Swedish judge, Per Lennerbrant, said the performer and his two co-accused could be released from custody and were free to leave the country ahead of his verdict. Such a ruling may point to an acquittal, or a sentence of less than the time already served, Reuters reported. Mr Jovicic said his client ""is a free person for now"" but has a ""nervous wait for two more weeks"". The case has made waves internationally, with an online petition for the rapper's release garnering more than 640,000 signatures. US President Donald Trump was among those to back a #JusticeForRocky campaign that attracted the support of celebrities such as Kanye West and Justin Bieber. The US president even sent his special envoy on hostage affairs - Robert O'Brien - to Sweden to attend the trial. On Friday, Mr Trump claimed ASAP Rocky was ""on his way home to the United States"" in a tweet posted shortly after the ruling to temporarily free the rapper. Mr O'Brien told reporters he had called the president to tell him the rapper ""would be back in America soon"", but did not elaborate on the timescale. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this week, ASAP Rocky said that he and his team had felt threatened by the people they clashed with and said he is not looking for money but wants justice and for his name to be cleared. Much of the trial has centred around analysing videos and whether bottles had been used as weapons during the alleged assault. The rapper did not deny he was holding a glass bottle in his hand - but says he picked it up briefly before putting it back down. The prosecution claimed a bottle was used in the fight, but the US star insisted he did not use it to hurt the alleged victim. On Friday, ASAP Rocky's bodyguard said the teenager had been ""harassing"" and ""following"" the group and ""swung"" at him prior to the brawl. After being released the rapper said it had been a ""difficult and humbling experience"" in a post on Insatgram. The court also heard from a psychologist, who told the court the alleged victim is not sleeping at night, has lost concentration, and is afraid. Fans of ASAP Rocky have been gathering at the court in Stockholm all week, shouting chants such as 'Free Rocky' Earlier this week, the prosecution went through a detailed 522-page preliminary report, which contained extensive photographs of injuries the alleged victim suffered. The man, who is not being named by media, has claimed damages of roughly Â£12,000 (139,700 Swedish Krona). During his evidence, he told the court he was looking for a friend and first approached the rapper and his entourage to ask ""if they knew where his mate was"". When asked by ASAP Rocky's lawyer if he knew the rapper was famous he said: ""Honestly not."" Injuries on the alleged victim's body - which prosecutors claim are consistent with use of a bottle Fans Arvin Flod and his friend Martyna Lechowska have turned up at the court in Stockholm Fans of the rapper have been gathering at court in Sweden in growing numbers over the week. Patrick, 16, says he wants to ""seek justice"" and thinks the rapper has ""lots of energy"" and ""good vibes"". He says the case could have a negative impact on Sweden in the future because he believes ""other rappers won't come and do gigs"". 20-year-old Arvin Flod says the case is the ""biggest thing in Sweden right now"", while his friend Martyna Lechowska, 20, doesn't think he should have ""locked in for such a long time"" already. If found guilty, the men on trial could face up to two years behind bars. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"This video can not be played Did the Liberal Democrats play ""dirty"" to win the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election? The Liberal Democrats have won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, leaving new PM Boris Johnson with a working majority in Parliament of one. Jane Dodds overturned an 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. Mr Davies stood again after being unseated by a petition following hisconviction for a false expenses claim. It was the first electoral test for Mr Johnson just eight days after becoming prime minister. What does the result tell us? By-election as it unfolded It was also the quickest by-election defeat for any new prime minister since World War Two. Now, with the thinnest majority, he will have to rely heavily on the support of his own MPs and hisconfidence-and-supply partners the DUPto get any legislation passed in key votes. This video can not be played Jane Dodds said the voters had chosen ""hope over fear"" It was a bad night for Labour, whose vote share dropped by 12.4% as it was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit Party. The result means the Lib Dems now have 13 MPs. Ms Dodds, who is the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""My very first act as your new MP when I get to Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he's hiding, and tell him to stop playing with the future of our community and rule out a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Davies congratulated Ms Dodds saying ""I wish her well for the future"" and paid tribute to his family saying they had ""a difficult time over the past few months"". The turnout was 59.6%, down from 74.6% at the general election, but it is the highest for a by-election since Winchester in 1997. Neither Plaid Cymru nor the Greens fielded candidates, to try to maximise the Remain vote. Tory party chairman James Cleverly toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme it was a ""very close result in a by-election in which the Lib Dems were expected to romp home comfortably"". In a message to Conservative MPs concerned about the government's Brexit policy he said the new prime minister had received a ""clear mandate from parliamentarians"" and an ""even more thumping victory in the leadership election"". ""I do think it's incumbent on all Conservatives to support the prime minister in what has been a long-standing Conservative policy,"" he said. But recently-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Boris Johnson's shrinking majority makes it clear that he has no mandate to crash us out of the EU."" She denied the party had ""played"" the system by striking a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I want to have a different voting system but we're working within the system that we have,"" she said. New Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Celebrating victory later on Friday morning with party activists, Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""winning again"" and she would ""fight to keep our country in the European Union"". Ms Dodds, 55, lives in the neighbouring mid Wales constituency of Montgomeryshire and is a child-protection social worker. The Lib Dems have held the rural seat for all but nine of the last 34 years and lost at the 2015 general election. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""spirit of co-operation"" between the pro-Remain parties had led to Ms Dodds's election, as he called for another EU referendum. ""But if the prime minister is intent on a general election, he should know that Plaid Cymru and the other pro-Remain parties are committed to cooperating so that we beat Brexit once and for all,"" he said. Wales Green Party leader Anthony Slaughter said its decision to withdraw from the by-election was ""absolutely vindicated"" by the result. ""The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson's majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the result ""disappointing"". He added: ""The Liberal Democrats won it after doing a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I think that a lot of voters were determined to get rid of the Conservative, and they voted accordingly. So we were squeezed, but it's a place we have not held for a very long time. The area has changed a bit."" Prof Laura McAllister, from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, said the result should not be read as a ""resounding victory"" for Remain. She pointed out that the three Brexit-supporting parties had 2-3,000 votes more than the Remain alliance. But she added: ""There are always nuanced undercurrents to this. The reality is Brexit isn't the only issue people were voting on. ""People were probably voting on rural and local issues. We can never categorically say this was about Brexit."" Jo Swinson: ""I will fight to keep our country in the European Union"" Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives were enjoying a ""Boris bounce"" and the result was encouraging for the party despite the loss. But he added: ""In an early general election, at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing."" He said the Lib Dems could pick up 40 or 50 seats, which would make winning a large overall majority ""rather more difficult for the Conservatives"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent As the ballots were counted, the candidates looked on - neither the Tories nor the Liberal Democrats dared to claim victory or concede defeat. One thing was certain, the result when it came would be close. But a win is a win and the Lib Dems will shout this from the rooftops as proof they can cut through with an anti-Brexit message. The Remain alliance proved to be a winning formula, as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party stood aside to give the Lib Dems a clear run against the Tories. If the Brexit Party hadn't been standing, the Conservatives might have clinched it. Labour will look hard at its disastrous result and wonder what might have been with a clearer message on Brexit. And for the Tories, the people of Brecon and Radnorshire have delivered an unwelcome verdict on their former MP and the new prime minister. Boris Johnson's hands were already tied in parliament and the ropes around his wrists have just been pulled a little tighter. Why does this by-election matter? Who were the candidates? A look back at the 1985 by-election At one stage Labour feared it might lose its deposit and blamed voters switching tactically to the Lib Dems. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""We always knew this was going to be a difficult night for us, but we're proud of our positive campaign in Brecon and Radnorshire."" ""One thing is clear - voters have rejected Boris Johnson and his divisive, out-of-touch UK Tory government."" Chris Davies said his family had been through a difficult time over the past few months Political analyst Prof Roger Awan-Scully, from Cardiff University, said: ""Labour need to look very closely at this result. Everything points to not just tactical voting for the Lib Dems but also dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn and [First Minister] Mark Drakeford."" The Brexit Party's Des Parkinson, a retired police chief superintendent, who finished third, said: ""If you look at the actual total of the vote, the Brexiteers won. ""It shows where the votes are but the prime minister has to deliver a clear Brexit... if he doesn't, then his government is in dire trouble."" The Monster Raving Loony Party pushed the UKIP candidate into sixth place. Voters have also given their thoughts on the result. Farmer Trevor Walters voted for Mr Davies and said the Tories might have won, had the Brexit Party not stood, but called the speculation over a Brexit no-deal fallout ""scaremongering"". He added: ""We're not going to be left in the lurch. I don't think for one second that'll happen. Something will be done to sweeten the blow of all that and get us engaged with a proper trade deal."" Independent book shop owner Emma Corfield-Walters, who backed the Lib Dems, said: ""None of us know what's going to happen in the future.

"Parts of the city of Salisbury were sealed off after the nerve agent attack in 2018 US President Donald Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK in March 2018. US banks are now banned from providing loans to Russia, and Washington will also be opposing any loan extension to Moscow by international institutions. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury, though they have now recovered. Russia denies any role in the attack. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the latest US move, Russia's Ria news agency reports. Mr Trump signed an executive order to impose the second set of sanctions on Thursday.,external The sanctions include opposing ""the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance... by international financial institutions"". The new measures would also ""prohibit any United States bank from making any loan or providing any credit... except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities or products"". President Putin (left) and President Trump last met during the G20 summit in Japan in June The sanctions were imposed under America's Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act adopted in 1991. The act mandates the imposition of new sanctions within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurance that it will no longer use chemical weapons. The first set of US sanctions against Russia was imposed last August. They covered exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that could have military applications. Restrictions were also placed on Russian access to US financial services. In recent months, the US Congress has been pressing President Trump to act again, saying that the 90-day deadline had long expired. The sanctions came a day after Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation. Both the White House and the Kremlin said the two leaders discussed massive wildfires raging in Russia. They did not say whether the sanctions issue was also raised. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were discovered unconscious on a bench in the UK city of Salisbury on 4 March. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the Novichok attack. The investigation also identified two suspects using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - both denied any involvement. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury Mr Skripal and his daughter recovered after intensive care in hospital, and their current whereabouts are being kept secret. Will Salisbury poison suspects face UK trial? What are nerve agents and what do they do? The attack prompted the UK and its Western allies to expel many Russian diplomats - and Russia retaliated with its own expulsions. Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate-general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. After tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had also been exposed to Novichok. What happened to the Skripals? What are Novichok nerve agents?

"This video can not be played An RAF Chinook is dropping 400 tonnes of aggregate to shore up the dam and divert water Emergency crews are racing to save a damaged reservoir, as ""terrified"" residents fear their Derbyshire town could be flooded. Police say the wall holding back the 300-million-gallon Toddbrook Reservoir could still fail despite about 24 hours of efforts to shore it up. Part of the dam wall collapsed on Thursday afternoon. The 1,500people evacuated from Whaley Bridgeamid ""mortal danger"" warnings will not be allowed home tonight. But the water level has dropped by half a metre thanks to ten fire service pumps moving 4.2 million litres of water every hour - with more pumps on the way. An RAF helicopter is also halfway through dropping 400 tonnes of aggregate on the collapsed section. The clay under the slipway has been undermined Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the dam could collapse. Julie Sharman, from the Canal and Rivers Trust, said it was ""a critical situation"" but added the weather had improved and the water levels had reduced by 20cm. ""We aren't putting a figure on any risk of collapse but everything that can be done is being done,"" she said. Engineers are attempting to get the reservoir's water level down, to reduce pressure on the wall and allow repairs to begin. The dam holds back 1.3 million tonnes of water About 1,500 people left their homes after police told them to pack up their medication and pets and gather at an evacuation point. Some stayed with relatives while others bedded down in pubs and hotels, with lots of businesses offering free rooms. Police said residents would not be allowed back on Friday so would spend a second night away from their homes. Bev Goodwin has put up friends and family after they left Whaley Bridge Bev Goodwin lives in Chapel-en-le-Frith and put up her mum and dad, Joy and Steve and two friends - Susie and Angela. Joy said: ""We have nothing. No clothes, no toothbrush, nothing. ""We have been thinking about what's in our house that we would miss - all our kids' pictures and of our grandchildren - it's upsetting."" Latest updates on the battle to save the dam In pictures: Dam collapse 'Stalwart spirit' shown as dam town evacuated Susie said: ""It's just surreal that it's happening in our town, it's just bizarre."" Mike Breslin described it as a ""crazy situation"". ""They should never have built a school and a social club at the bottom of a dam. It's madness,"" he said. Resident Mike Breslin said it was 'madness' to build a school at the base of the dam Eric Baker, who has lived in the town for 30 years said: ""It's shocking really, it's like living next to a ticking bomb. If that goes the devastation will be unimaginable. ""We saw the water coming over at a tremendous rate on Wednesday and the park was flooded but it wasn't until Thursday the people who look after it started to look worried. ""Then it started to collapse on Thursday and it made a tremendous noise as the concrete slabs began to collapse. ""The disruption is huge, the small shops and businesses are really being hit and of course we don't know when it will be over."" Public agencies and the army have been praised for their efforts Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: ""We just fled. I managed to take my nightdress and we've got the tortoise in the washing up bowl in the car. ""It's quite terrifying. If the dam goes, it will take out the whole town."" Teams have worked through the night Nigel Carson, who lives near the dam, said he had been told it would take two or three days to reduce the reservoir to a safe level if it does not rain. There are no weather warnings in place for Friday, and the Met Office has said it expects much drier conditions. Heavy rain causes 'major damage' at stately home BBC reporter Richard Stead described the operation to fix the dam as ""a two-pronged attack"". He said: ""The Chinook is bringing aggregate on the one hand to shore up the dam, but also to divert water further up the valley away from the reservoir. ""There are also 16 high-volume pumps being used to relieve the pressure on the dam. ""Only when that is done can work start on permanent repairs and finding out what went wrong."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asked the Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers to chair an emergency meeting. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This isn't the first time communities have faced the nightmare of a dam that could collapse. Back in 2007 a dam near Rotherham was the cause of a major alert, and the scenario is very similar to now. Torrential rain had filled the Ulley reservoir to overflowing. Cracks appeared in the dam itself. People downstream were told to leave. The M1 motorway was in the path of a potential burst so part of it was closed. As with the dam at Whaley Bridge, the one at Ulley was built in the 19th Century with the same combination of clay and mud. In the end, pumps relieved the pressure and nearly 3000 tonnes of rock strengthened the structure so the emergency passed. But over the following three years a huge repair operation costing Â£3.8m was needed. And a major review of the 2007 floods was highly critical of the way many of Britain's dams are monitored. Whatever happens at Whaley Bridge, questions will be asked about safety and whether ageing infrastructure can cope with the heavier downpours predicted as the climate warms. This video can not be played Toddbrook Reservoir: Footage shows fast-flowing water before collapse Part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. It was damaged after large swathes of the country were battered by heavy rain and floods earlier in the week. Police told residents in Whaley Bridge to gather at Chapel High School in neighbouring Chapel-en-le-Frith. They were told to take pets and medication with them as it was unclear how long it would take to repair the damaged wall. Pumps from fire services across the country have been pumping out 7,000 litres of water a minute. Army engineers are clearing trees and bushes to get ""five or six"" more water pumps in on south side of reservoir. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service said more than 150 firefighters from across the UK have been supporting the work at the dam and in the town.

"US rapper ASAP Rocky has temporarily been released from custody in Sweden. The 30-year-old, real name Rakim Mayers, will be freed until a judge returns a verdict in the assault trial on 14 August. He and two of his entourage have pleaded not guilty to assaulting a 19-year-old man in Stockholm in June. Over the past week, a court has heard evidence and testimonies about the brawl, which led to ASAP Rocky's detention in the country. Allow Instagram content?

The rapper says he, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers were acting in self-defence in fighting that broke out near the Max Burger chain on 30 June, after two men allegedly refused to stop following his entourage. But in court on Friday, the prosecution said ASAP Rocky and his companions had ""every possibility"" to leave the scene and that they were not in a position where they needed to use ""self-defence"". During his summing up, prosecutor Daniel Suneson told the Stockholm District Court the rapper should be jailed for about six months. ASAP Rocky's defence lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, argued the incident was not a pre-meditated group assault and the rapper should be set free. ASAP Rocky (back right) smiled widely as he left the district court The Swedish judge, Per Lennerbrant, said the performer and his two co-accused could be released from custody and were free to leave the country ahead of his verdict. Such a ruling may point to an acquittal, or a sentence of less than the time already served, Reuters reported. Mr Jovicic said his client ""is a free person for now"" but has a ""nervous wait for two more weeks"". The case has made waves internationally, with an online petition for the rapper's release garnering more than 640,000 signatures. US President Donald Trump was among those to back a #JusticeForRocky campaign that attracted the support of celebrities such as Kanye West and Justin Bieber. The US president even sent his special envoy on hostage affairs - Robert O'Brien - to Sweden to attend the trial. On Friday, Mr Trump claimed ASAP Rocky was ""on his way home to the United States"" in a tweet posted shortly after the ruling to temporarily free the rapper. Mr O'Brien told reporters he had called the president to tell him the rapper ""would be back in America soon"", but did not elaborate on the timescale. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this week, ASAP Rocky said that he and his team had felt threatened by the people they clashed with and said he is not looking for money but wants justice and for his name to be cleared. Much of the trial has centred around analysing videos and whether bottles had been used as weapons during the alleged assault. The rapper did not deny he was holding a glass bottle in his hand - but says he picked it up briefly before putting it back down. The prosecution claimed a bottle was used in the fight, but the US star insisted he did not use it to hurt the alleged victim. On Friday, ASAP Rocky's bodyguard said the teenager had been ""harassing"" and ""following"" the group and ""swung"" at him prior to the brawl. After being released the rapper said it had been a ""difficult and humbling experience"" in a post on Insatgram. The court also heard from a psychologist, who told the court the alleged victim is not sleeping at night, has lost concentration, and is afraid. Fans of ASAP Rocky have been gathering at the court in Stockholm all week, shouting chants such as 'Free Rocky' Earlier this week, the prosecution went through a detailed 522-page preliminary report, which contained extensive photographs of injuries the alleged victim suffered. The man, who is not being named by media, has claimed damages of roughly Â£12,000 (139,700 Swedish Krona). During his evidence, he told the court he was looking for a friend and first approached the rapper and his entourage to ask ""if they knew where his mate was"". When asked by ASAP Rocky's lawyer if he knew the rapper was famous he said: ""Honestly not."" Injuries on the alleged victim's body - which prosecutors claim are consistent with use of a bottle Fans Arvin Flod and his friend Martyna Lechowska have turned up at the court in Stockholm Fans of the rapper have been gathering at court in Sweden in growing numbers over the week. Patrick, 16, says he wants to ""seek justice"" and thinks the rapper has ""lots of energy"" and ""good vibes"". He says the case could have a negative impact on Sweden in the future because he believes ""other rappers won't come and do gigs"". 20-year-old Arvin Flod says the case is the ""biggest thing in Sweden right now"", while his friend Martyna Lechowska, 20, doesn't think he should have ""locked in for such a long time"" already. If found guilty, the men on trial could face up to two years behind bars. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"Alana Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College in Cambridge A Cambridge University student who plunged to her death from a light aircraft in Madagascar ""jumped"" from the plane, police have said. Alana Cutland, 19, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, died last week, but her body has still not been found. Police Colonel D'y La Paix Ralaivaonary told the BBC she ""fell into a crisis"" which involved ""paranoia"". He ruled out any connection to malaria drugs and said: ""It is confirmed that she opened the door and jumped."" The investigation into why Ms Cutland fell from the plane is continuing, but one theory was that she may have suffered a severe adverse reaction to anti-malaria drugs. The colonel said: ""We haven't heard about malaria drugs. ""We investigated butâ¦ she had problems. She fell into a crisis - paranoia."" The incident was ""not connected with drugs"", he added. Student Ms Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College and was on an internship on the African island at the time of the incident. Alana Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died Another police colonel, Jafisambatra Ravoavy, told the BBC she had opened the door of the plane soon after it took off from a remote airstrip in northern Madagascar, on 25 July. Col D'y La Paix Ralaivaonary said there had been a struggle on board and another female passenger had tried to stop Ms Cutland jumping, ""but wasn't able"". The passenger was now being supported by the British Embassy in the island's capital Antananarivo, he said.

"This video can not be played Ashes: England's Rory Burns scores maiden Test century v Australia on day two at Edgbaston Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day two of five) Australia 284:Smith 144, Broad 5-86 England 267-4:Burns 125*, Root 57 England trail by 17 runs Scorecard Rory Burns' maiden Test century led a determined England batting effort on the second day of the first Ashes Test against Australia at Edgbaston. The left-handed opener, playing his eighth match, battled through an attritional day for 125 not out. With Joe Root making 57 in a second-wicket stand of 132 and Ben Stokes an unbeaten 38, England reached 267-4, trailing by 17. England had slices of luck. Burns was on 21 when he would have been lbw to Nathan Lyon had Australia opted to review, while Root survived a James Pattinson delivery hitting off stump but not dislodging the bails when he was on nine. Those incidents were characteristic of a day when Australia bowled well for little reward in front of another noisy crowd that celebrated every England run and basked in the warm evening sunshine. Only when they persuaded the umpires to change the ball did the tourists have a period of success, with Joe Denly and Jos Buttler falling in the space of four overs. But Stokes, given a hero's welcome after his performance in the World Cup final, joined Burns in an unbroken stand of 73 for the fifth wicket. It leaves England in a strong position, even if they are likely to need a healthy first-innings lead to negate the disadvantage of batting last on a pitch already offering sharp turn. 'I was ready to run through a brick wall' - Burns inspired by 2005 Ashes winners 'Burns finally cracks the curse of the England opener' Arthur in frame for England job Listen: TMS podcast - Burns batting something 'Alastair Cook would be proud of' This video can not be played Burns survives lbw appeal on 21 as Australia unwisely decide not to review Speaking before the series, England coach Trevor Bayliss said ""you do not have to be Einstein"" to deduce that an unreliable top order was their biggest obstacle to regaining the Ashes. In an unconvincing display against Ireland last week, when England were bowled out for 85 in the first innings, it was Burns who looked the most vulnerable. Here, though, the Surrey man was the mainstay of a collective England showing of old-fashioned batting values - patience, watchfulness and occupation of the crease. It meant that the action was much more sedate than the chaos of the opening day, but the home crowd were just as keen to sing for England and taunt the Australians. Like Thursday, umpiring errors were a feature, but more forgivable. It was a surprise when Burns was shown to be lbw to Lyon, the noise of ball hitting stump actually led to Root being given caught behind and a tiny inside edge was not detected when he was given leg before to Peter Siddle on 14. Both were overturned. On top of England's solid day with the bat, there was also the welcome sight of James Anderson running on the outfield, but there is still no news from the scan on his injured calf. This video can not be played Unbelievable! - Ball hits stumps but Root survives Following Australia's Steve Smith on day one, Burns became the second idiosyncratic centurion of the Test, with his leaning stance, glance to mid-wicket as the bowler runs in and bat that comes down from the direction of gully. After England resumed on 10-0, Jason Roy edged to first slip for 10, leaving Burns and Root to grind through the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon. Root scored only 11 from his first 60 balls, but gradually increased in fluency. Burns left well, scored mainly square of the wicket on both sides and had the fortune of a number of edges not going to hand. Just as England were gaining momentum, Root patted a drive back to Siddle that the bowler held one-handed, with Denly and Buttler following soon after. Burns continued the battle. He spent 37 minutes on 92 and 35 balls in the 90s before a single off Lyon - confirmed after he was shown to have beaten a direct hit to the non-striker's end - sparked an emotional celebration and chants of his name from the Hollies Stand. Together with Stokes, he repelled the second new ball to take England to the brink of parity. This video can not be played Watch Burns reach his maiden Test century Bar bowling a fraction too short in the morning and off-spinner Lyon occasionally drifting on to the pads of England's left-handers, Australia toiled honestly and without the rub of the green. How different might the day have been had the bails fallen when Pattinson got through Root to hit the off stump? On another occasion, one of Burns' edges could have found a slip fielder. They were at least boosted 58 overs into the day when they convinced the umpires that the ball had gone out of shape and were given a replacement that swung much more than the previous version. Pattinson immediately shaped one into Denly that pinned him leg before, while Cummins' away movement had Buttler edge to third slip. That, though, was the best it got for the visitors, who at one point gave an over to Matthew Wade, a wicketkeeper by trade. After an unsuccessful review against Burns, the day ended with Australia being subjected to a barrage of mock appeals from the Hollies. England v Australia - highlights & reaction This video can not be played 'A big breakthrough' - Roy out for 10 England's Rory Burns on BBC Test Match Special:""It is something I have dreamt of. I was on 99 for a while - to get over the line is awesome. I was calm throughout it. I was waiting for a ball to come into my area. ""It was one for the purists - hard work. I enjoy that. Getting in the battle and doing what you can is enough for me."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""Rory Burns has arrived here at Edgbaston. Mentally, he showed he is made of strong stuff. ""Alastair Cook would have been proud of that innings. There is no greater compliment for an England opening batsman. ""He was all over the shop against Ireland last week. His technique was not with him. He has gone away and worked with his coaches. He has got his hands tighter to his body and had a great game plan. To bat all day was fantastic. ""That was the best day of Test match batting I have seen from England in a long, long time."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England really should be looking to establish a sizable first-innings lead tomorrow - and they will need it."" Burns is the first England opener to bat through a day in a Test since Alastair Cook against Australia at Melbourne in 2017 Burns spent 54 minutes in the nineties He is the first opener to score a hundred in England other than Alastair Cook since Adam Lyth in 2015 England and Wales Cricket Board Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?

"Parts of the city of Salisbury were sealed off after the nerve agent attack in 2018 US President Donald Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK in March 2018. US banks are now banned from providing loans to Russia, and Washington will also be opposing any loan extension to Moscow by international institutions. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury, though they have now recovered. Russia denies any role in the attack. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the latest US move, Russia's Ria news agency reports. Mr Trump signed an executive order to impose the second set of sanctions on Thursday.,external The sanctions include opposing ""the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance... by international financial institutions"". The new measures would also ""prohibit any United States bank from making any loan or providing any credit... except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities or products"". President Putin (left) and President Trump last met during the G20 summit in Japan in June The sanctions were imposed under America's Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act adopted in 1991. The act mandates the imposition of new sanctions within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurance that it will no longer use chemical weapons. The first set of US sanctions against Russia was imposed last August. They covered exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that could have military applications. Restrictions were also placed on Russian access to US financial services. In recent months, the US Congress has been pressing President Trump to act again, saying that the 90-day deadline had long expired. The sanctions came a day after Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation. Both the White House and the Kremlin said the two leaders discussed massive wildfires raging in Russia. They did not say whether the sanctions issue was also raised. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were discovered unconscious on a bench in the UK city of Salisbury on 4 March. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the Novichok attack. The investigation also identified two suspects using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - both denied any involvement. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury Mr Skripal and his daughter recovered after intensive care in hospital, and their current whereabouts are being kept secret. Will Salisbury poison suspects face UK trial? What are nerve agents and what do they do? The attack prompted the UK and its Western allies to expel many Russian diplomats - and Russia retaliated with its own expulsions. Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate-general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. After tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had also been exposed to Novichok. What happened to the Skripals? What are Novichok nerve agents?

"The Aberthaw Power Station in the Vale of Glamorgan has been operating since 1971 Wales' last coal-fired power station looks set to close in March due to ""market conditions"", putting about 170 jobs at risk. RWE said it was proposing closing the 1.56-megawatt Aberthaw B Power Station in Vale of Glamorgan on 31 March. It will now consult staff and their representatives but the closure would not affect the amount of energy provided to the market, RWE said. The Unite union said it was asking for an urgent meeting with management. The plant, which opened in 1971 at a cost of more than Â£50m, was due to remain in operation until 2021. Tower train marks end of Welsh coal era Court action over Aberthaw emissions Power station to downgrade operations It used 3.5 million tonnes of coal in 2013, but that amount had fallen significantly by the timeRWE decided to only generate electricity when needed, such as in the winter months, from April 2017. ""This is a difficult time for everyone at Aberthaw Power Station,"" said Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation. ""However, market conditions made this decision necessary."" The closure will put 170 jobs at risk Unite's regional officer Kelvin Mawer said: ""We will be asking for an urgent meeting with the management of RWE Generation for them to explain the earlier than expected closure of the plant. ""We want to know why the closure of the plant has been brought forward to next March from the anticipated date of 2021."" In 2016, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found the Aberthaw plant had beenemitting illegal levels of pollution. Friends of the Earth, which has long called for the plant's closure, welcomed the announcement and called for more investment in green energy. Haf Elgar, director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, said: ""The writing's on the wall for the coal industry - we cannot keep burning fossil fuels in a climate emergency and we must stop now.""

"Goals Soccer Centres , which runs outdoor football centres in the UK, has uncovered ""improper behaviour"" in the preparation of its financial accounts stretching back to 2010 ""at least"". The firm has blamed ""a number of individuals"" for the behaviour. Following the revelations, the company's shares are set to be kicked off the stock exchange. The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who owns a 19% stake in the firm. Goals said that, as the issues with the accounts stretch back nearly a decade, there was ""material uncertainty"" surrounding its historical financial statements. Dealing in the firm's shares wassuspended in Marchwhen Goals revealed that ""substantial"" VAT errors were likely to cost it Â£12m. At the time, it said the blunder ""may have an impact on future profitability"", and it delayed the publication of its financial results for last year as it worked to revise them. It had until the end of September to release those results but now it expects to miss that deadline. ""The directors do not now believe this timeframe for the audit is achievable,"" the firm told shareholders. As a result Goals no longer expects its shares to resume trading. The listing of its shares on the AIM market is ""expected to cease and cancellation will be effective from 30 September 2019"". Goals, which has 45 pitches in the UK, said conversations were continuing with HMRC over its tax bill but revealed there had been ""no material developments"" in those talks. Nevertheless, it said UK sales had increased over 11% so far this year. They were up almost 15% in the US where it runs sites in California.

"Alana Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College in Cambridge A Cambridge University student who plunged to her death from a light aircraft in Madagascar ""jumped"" from the plane, police have said. Alana Cutland, 19, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, died last week, but her body has still not been found. Police Colonel D'y La Paix Ralaivaonary told the BBC she ""fell into a crisis"" which involved ""paranoia"". He ruled out any connection to malaria drugs and said: ""It is confirmed that she opened the door and jumped."" The investigation into why Ms Cutland fell from the plane is continuing, but one theory was that she may have suffered a severe adverse reaction to anti-malaria drugs. The colonel said: ""We haven't heard about malaria drugs. ""We investigated butâ¦ she had problems. She fell into a crisis - paranoia."" The incident was ""not connected with drugs"", he added. Student Ms Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College and was on an internship on the African island at the time of the incident. Alana Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died Another police colonel, Jafisambatra Ravoavy, told the BBC she had opened the door of the plane soon after it took off from a remote airstrip in northern Madagascar, on 25 July. Col D'y La Paix Ralaivaonary said there had been a struggle on board and another female passenger had tried to stop Ms Cutland jumping, ""but wasn't able"".

"This video can not be played Shock of no deal would be instant, says Mark Carney A no-deal Brexit would result in an instant shock to the UK economy, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned. Items such as petrol and food would become more expensive if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, he said. He predicted the value of the pound would fall in response to what he described as a ""real economic shock"". ""The change in trading relationship means that real incomes will be lower,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. But he rejected claims that the Bank's decision to cut growth forecasts was gloomy, after former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accused him of reviving ""project fear"". Mr Carney said ""you're hard pressed"" to describe the Bank's forecasts in that way. Faisal Islam: Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog Why the pound is getting weaker On Thursday,the Bank said the economy was expected to grow by 1.3% this year, lower than its earlier projection of 1.5%, if the UK leaves the EU with a deal. It did not say what it expected to happen in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Carney told the BBC there was a ""significant possibility"" that a deal would not be struck. ""The economics of no deal are that the rules of the game for exporting to Europe or importing from Europe fundamentally change,"" he said. As a result, he said, ""very big"" and ""highly profitable"" industries in the UK would become ""uneconomic"". Carmakers are among the firms that could be hardest hit, Mr Carney says. ""Very difficult decisions will need to be taken,"" he said, explaining that those would have a ""knock-on"" effect on the economy. He pointed to carmakers, food manufacturers and chemical firms as some of those that would be hardest hit. ""These are the sectors that have not been investing,"" he said. ""One of the reasons why the economy has slowed is that business investment has been very, very weak."" But Mr Carney said the Bank's response to a no-deal Brexit would not be automatic. He explained the Bank would look at the effect on the economy of things such as car plant closures as well as a weakening pound before it decided how to respond. ""We will do everything we can in order to provide support to the economy,"" he said. But he warned that a no-deal Brexit would be inflationary. ""Instantly, you have supply disruptions but you actually have businesses that are no longer economic."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility warnedthat a no-deal Brexit would deal a Â£29.3bn blow to the UK economy. In comments on the front page of Friday's Daily Telegraph, Brexit-backing Mr Duncan Smith renewed his criticism of Mr Carney. Ahead of the referendum in 2016,Mr Carney warned that the UK could fall into a recessionif it voted to leave the EU - something that did not happen. At the time, Mr Duncan Smith said the Bank of England governor needed to be ""very careful"" about making such comments. On Friday, Mr Duncan Smith called Mr Carney ""one of the architects and promoters of 'project fear'"". But speaking on the Today programme, Mr Carney said it was ""not helpful"" to deny that leaving ""the most integrated economic relationship in the world"" would have an impact on the economy.

"US stock markets have fallen for a second day following a decision by Donald Trump to impose new tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese imports. The three main US indexes all closed the week down, following sharp falls in Europe and Asia. The US President's move came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The 10% tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: Caught in the crossfire The tariffs are likely to target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry warned the country would retaliate against the US for imposing duties. ""If the US implements the tariff measures, China will have to take necessary counter-measures to resolutely defend the core interests of the country and its people."" She declined to say what this might involve, but earlier this yearit China signalled that it may curb exports of rare earth minerals to the US. China is the largest producer of rare earths which are vital to a number of US industries such as electric car manufacturing and wind turbine production. US stock markets have dropped since Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter on Thursday, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai. He also attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In later remarks, the US president told reporters the 10% tariffs were a short-term measure and could be lifted in stages to more than 25%. This would be on top of the $250bn of Chinese goods that are already being taxed at 25% by the Trump administration. Research firm Oxford Economics said: ""We expect this step to make China less keen to achieve a deal and more determined to prepare itself for long-term economic tension with the US."" This video can not be played At the end of June, Mr Trump said the US wasn't about to add any new tariffs on Chinese goods The move surprised markets because Washington and Beijing had described this week's trade negotiations as constructive and scheduled another round of talks for September. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties comes amid growing concern that Mr Trump's strategy may be backfiring. On Thursday, his former chief economic adviser,Gary Cohn, told the BBCthat the tariff battle was having a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment. The resulting tensions have also influencedthe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Fed chair Jerome Powell said it was not the central bank's job to criticise US trade policy, but added that trade tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June. In the US, the Nasdaq index was the biggest faller on Friday, down 1.3%. The technology companies listed on the index are seen as particularly vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese goods because many source components from China or produce their goods there. The US indexes had already fallen sharply on Thursday when Mr Trump made the surprise announcement, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed 0.37% and 0.73% lower respectively on Friday. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index ended 2.3% lower, Germany's Dax index dropped 2.9% and the Cac 40 in France fell 3.3% by the close of trading. Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei index had fallen more than 2%. Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea. China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Over the past year, both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war which has rattled investors and cast a shadow over the global economy.

But speaking on the Today programme, Mr Carney said it was ""not helpful"" to deny that leaving ""the most integrated economic relationship in the world"" would have an impact on the economy.

"US stock markets have fallen for a second day following a decision by Donald Trump to impose new tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese imports. The three main US indexes all closed the week down, following sharp falls in Europe and Asia. The US President's move came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The 10% tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: Caught in the crossfire The tariffs are likely to target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry warned the country would retaliate against the US for imposing duties. ""If the US implements the tariff measures, China will have to take necessary counter-measures to resolutely defend the core interests of the country and its people."" She declined to say what this might involve, but earlier this yearit China signalled that it may curb exports of rare earth minerals to the US. China is the largest producer of rare earths which are vital to a number of US industries such as electric car manufacturing and wind turbine production. US stock markets have dropped since Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter on Thursday, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai. He also attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In later remarks, the US president told reporters the 10% tariffs were a short-term measure and could be lifted in stages to more than 25%. This would be on top of the $250bn of Chinese goods that are already being taxed at 25% by the Trump administration. Research firm Oxford Economics said: ""We expect this step to make China less keen to achieve a deal and more determined to prepare itself for long-term economic tension with the US."" This video can not be played At the end of June, Mr Trump said the US wasn't about to add any new tariffs on Chinese goods The move surprised markets because Washington and Beijing had described this week's trade negotiations as constructive and scheduled another round of talks for September. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties comes amid growing concern that Mr Trump's strategy may be backfiring. On Thursday, his former chief economic adviser,Gary Cohn, told the BBCthat the tariff battle was having a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment. The resulting tensions have also influencedthe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Fed chair Jerome Powell said it was not the central bank's job to criticise US trade policy, but added that trade tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June. In the US, the Nasdaq index was the biggest faller on Friday, down 1.3%. The technology companies listed on the index are seen as particularly vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese goods because many source components from China or produce their goods there. The US indexes had already fallen sharply on Thursday when Mr Trump made the surprise announcement, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed 0.37% and 0.73% lower respectively on Friday. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index ended 2.3% lower, Germany's Dax index dropped 2.9% and the Cac 40 in France fell 3.3% by the close of trading. Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei index had fallen more than 2%. Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea. China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Over the past year, both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war which has rattled investors and cast a shadow over the global economy.

"The move now puts women on an equal footing to men with regard to travel rights Women in Saudi Arabia can now travel abroad without a male guardian's permission, royal decrees say. The new rule announced on Friday allows women over the age of 21 to apply for a passport without authorisation, putting them on an equal footing to men. Women are also being given the right to register births, marriage or divorce. The kingdom has recently eased other long-standing social restrictions on women, though campaigners say more remains to be done for women's rights. Saudi Arabia has increasingly come under the spotlight over its treatment of its female citizens, an issue highlighted by several high-profile cases of Saudi women seeking asylum abroad. This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum The de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sought to relax prohibitions on women, includinglifting a driving ban last year, in a bid to open up the conservative kingdom. But he has also cracked down on women's rights activists, putting a number of them on trial in recent months. Saudi's male guardianship system gives husbands, fathers and other male relatives the authority to make critical decisions about women. Until now, this has meant women there were required to seek those relatives' permission to obtain or renew a passport and exit the country. 'Men raised their eyebrows when they saw me driving' Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system 'I needed consent to leave the house' But the royal decrees published in the kingdom's official weekly Um al-Qura gazette on Friday stipulate that Saudi passports should be issued to any citizen who applies for it, and that anyone over the age of 21 does not need permission to travel. The changes allow women for the first time to register their children's births, as well as marriages and divorces. They also cover employment regulations that expand work opportunities for women. Under the rule, all citizens have the right to work without facing any discrimination based on gender, disability or age. Many Saudi women have taken to Twitter to celebrate the move, with prominent influencer and talk show host Muna AbuSulayman tweeting: ""A generation growing up completely free and equal to their brothers.""

Some conservatives in the country have reacted negatively to the changes, with one woman telling Reuters news agency: ""Imagine if your girls grow up and leave you and don't return, would you be happy?"" Despite the latest reforms, other parts of the guardianship system remain in place. These include women requiring permission from a male relative to marry or live on their own, as well as leave prison if they have been detained. They still cannot pass on citizenship to their children, nor can they provide consent for their children to marry. Saudi women were allowed to drive more than a year ago, but restrictions on them remain In a bid to open up the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman unveiled a plan in 2016 to transform the economy by 2030, with the aim of increasing women's participation in the workforce to 30% from 22%. However, rights groups have decried his crackdown over the last year on some of the country's leading women's rights activists who had campaigned for the right to drive or win equal rights to men. These women, including prominent campaigner Loujain al-Hathloul, are currently facing trialand several of them say they have been tortured whilst in detention. #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Why I had to leave Saudi Arabia 'We were treated like slaves' There have been several high profile cases of women seeking asylum in countries such as Canada, citing claims of gender oppression. This video can not be played Two Saudis who sought asylum in the UK explain why they risked everything The issue hit the headlines in January when18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun fled Saudi Arabia in a bid to escape to Australia, but ended up in a stand-off at an airport hotel in the Thai capital Bangkok. After international appeals for help, Canada later granted her asylum. In March,two young Saudi sisters who had been hiding in Hong Kong were granted humanitarian visasin a third country. In a similar case a month later,another pair of sisters fled to Georgiaafter seeking international help on Twitter and were eventually relocated to another country. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs analyst This is the biggest move so far to dismantle the male guardianship system in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women's rights activists have fought hard to remove the multiple restrictions on their lives - they presented a petition to the authorities demanding change some three years ago. But the leading women involved in that campaign are now either detained or abroad.  Internationally, their efforts have received great attention, but in Saudi Arabia itself, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his advisers still seem intent on denying them any credit for the changes. That makes reform appear to come from the top down.  For many Saudis - both men and women - this makes the Crown Prince a hero. Outside the Kingdom, it helps refurbish his image tarnished as it is bythe killing of Jamal Khashoggi- at a time when the Saudis are choosing to play an increasingly visible role on the world stage. But both hardline conservatives and women's rights activists in Saudi Arabia are united in their suspicion of Mohammed bin Salman's motives - and their sense that this is all about his continuing accumulation of power, whether political, financial or cultural.

"Goals Soccer Centres , which runs outdoor football centres in the UK, has uncovered ""improper behaviour"" in the preparation of its financial accounts stretching back to 2010 ""at least"". The firm has blamed ""a number of individuals"" for the behaviour. Following the revelations, the company's shares are set to be kicked off the stock exchange. The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who owns a 19% stake in the firm. Goals said that, as the issues with the accounts stretch back nearly a decade, there was ""material uncertainty"" surrounding its historical financial statements. Dealing in the firm's shares wassuspended in Marchwhen Goals revealed that ""substantial"" VAT errors were likely to cost it Â£12m. At the time, it said the blunder ""may have an impact on future profitability"", and it delayed the publication of its financial results for last year as it worked to revise them. It had until the end of September to release those results but now it expects to miss that deadline. ""The directors do not now believe this timeframe for the audit is achievable,"" the firm told shareholders. As a result Goals no longer expects its shares to resume trading. The listing of its shares on the AIM market is ""expected to cease and cancellation will be effective from 30 September 2019"". Goals, which has 45 pitches in the UK, said conversations were continuing with HMRC over its tax bill but revealed there had been ""no material developments"" in those talks. Nevertheless, it said UK sales had increased over 11% so far this year. They were up almost 15% in the US where it runs sites in California. In January, the East Kilbride-based firm warned on profits after it said that selling food and drink, and offering children's birthday parties, had increased costs as it had to hire more staff.

"This video can not be played Shock of no deal would be instant, says Mark Carney A no-deal Brexit would result in an instant shock to the UK economy, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned. Items such as petrol and food would become more expensive if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, he said. He predicted the value of the pound would fall in response to what he described as a ""real economic shock"". ""The change in trading relationship means that real incomes will be lower,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. But he rejected claims that the Bank's decision to cut growth forecasts was gloomy, after former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accused him of reviving ""project fear"". Mr Carney said ""you're hard pressed"" to describe the Bank's forecasts in that way. Faisal Islam: Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog Why the pound is getting weaker On Thursday,the Bank said the economy was expected to grow by 1.3% this year, lower than its earlier projection of 1.5%, if the UK leaves the EU with a deal. It did not say what it expected to happen in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Carney told the BBC there was a ""significant possibility"" that a deal would not be struck. ""The economics of no deal are that the rules of the game for exporting to Europe or importing from Europe fundamentally change,"" he said. As a result, he said, ""very big"" and ""highly profitable"" industries in the UK would become ""uneconomic"". Carmakers are among the firms that could be hardest hit, Mr Carney says. ""Very difficult decisions will need to be taken,"" he said, explaining that those would have a ""knock-on"" effect on the economy. He pointed to carmakers, food manufacturers and chemical firms as some of those that would be hardest hit. ""These are the sectors that have not been investing,"" he said. ""One of the reasons why the economy has slowed is that business investment has been very, very weak."" But Mr Carney said the Bank's response to a no-deal Brexit would not be automatic. He explained the Bank would look at the effect on the economy of things such as car plant closures as well as a weakening pound before it decided how to respond. ""We will do everything we can in order to provide support to the economy,"" he said. But he warned that a no-deal Brexit would be inflationary. ""Instantly, you have supply disruptions but you actually have businesses that are no longer economic."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility warnedthat a no-deal Brexit would deal a Â£29.3bn blow to the UK economy. In comments on the front page of Friday's Daily Telegraph, Brexit-backing Mr Duncan Smith renewed his criticism of Mr Carney. Ahead of the referendum in 2016,Mr Carney warned that the UK could fall into a recessionif it voted to leave the EU - something that did not happen. At the time, Mr Duncan Smith said the Bank of England governor needed to be ""very careful"" about making such comments. On Friday, Mr Duncan Smith called Mr Carney ""one of the architects and promoters of 'project fear'"". But speaking on the Today programme, Mr Carney said it was ""not helpful"" to deny that leaving ""the most integrated economic relationship in the world"" would have an impact on the economy.

"Mr Blevins made the announcement via a videos showing mock press conference Amazonâs games streaming platform Twitch has lost one of its biggest stars - to a rival site owned by Microsoft. Tyler Blevins, known to fans as Ninja, had 14.7 million followers on Twitch and mostly played Fortnite. Mixer was launched in 2016, but has lagged behind the popularity of Twitch and YouTube Gaming. In a statement, Microsoft said it was âthrilledâ to bring Blevins on board. ""Mixer is a place that was formed around being positive and welcoming from day one, and we look forward to the energy Ninja and his community will bring.â Blevins, 28, told his fans via Twitter about the move. ""I have been holding on to this for quite some time,â he said. ""Iâm just super-excited to let everyone know. Iâll be streaming on Mixer full-time now and Iâm honestly at a loss for words. Iâm freaking out in the best ways. I feel like Iâm going to get back to the streaming roots.â Tech Tent - playing games with video Twitch: Our top stars make millions of dollars a year Streamers banned for filming while driving The financial terms of the deal have not been made public. As well as streaming exclusively on the platform, Blevins will also represent and promote Mixer at events. In a peak month, Blevins was making a reported $500,000 streaming on Twitch. The move is likely to divide his fan base, suggested Janko Roettgers from entertainment business magazine, Variety. ""Ninja has a dedicated fan base, and many will likely tune in, no matter the platform,â he told the BBC. ""At the same time, the departure is also a chance for other Twitch streamers to scoop up some of the more casual viewers of Ninja's streams.â At the time of writing, 80,000 people had subscribed to Blevins's new channel on Mixer. Roettgers said the signing, probably for a huge amount of money, was a clear signal of intent from Microsoft to catch up in the streaming sector. ""Microsoft is trying to find new gaming revenue streams that go beyond selling hardware,â he said. In a statement following news of Blevinâs departure, Amazon said: ""Weâve loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that heâs accomplished for himself and his family and the gaming community.

"Mr Blevins made the announcement via a videos showing mock press conference Amazonâs games streaming platform Twitch has lost one of its biggest stars - to a rival site owned by Microsoft. Tyler Blevins, known to fans as Ninja, had 14.7 million followers on Twitch and mostly played Fortnite. Mixer was launched in 2016, but has lagged behind the popularity of Twitch and YouTube Gaming. In a statement, Microsoft said it was âthrilledâ to bring Blevins on board. ""Mixer is a place that was formed around being positive and welcoming from day one, and we look forward to the energy Ninja and his community will bring.â Blevins, 28, told his fans via Twitter about the move. ""I have been holding on to this for quite some time,â he said. ""Iâm just super-excited to let everyone know. Iâll be streaming on Mixer full-time now and Iâm honestly at a loss for words. Iâm freaking out in the best ways. I feel like Iâm going to get back to the streaming roots.â Tech Tent - playing games with video Twitch: Our top stars make millions of dollars a year Streamers banned for filming while driving The financial terms of the deal have not been made public. As well as streaming exclusively on the platform, Blevins will also represent and promote Mixer at events. In a peak month, Blevins was making a reported $500,000 streaming on Twitch. The move is likely to divide his fan base, suggested Janko Roettgers from entertainment business magazine, Variety. ""Ninja has a dedicated fan base, and many will likely tune in, no matter the platform,â he told the BBC. ""At the same time, the departure is also a chance for other Twitch streamers to scoop up some of the more casual viewers of Ninja's streams.â At the time of writing, 80,000 people had subscribed to Blevins's new channel on Mixer. Roettgers said the signing, probably for a huge amount of money, was a clear signal of intent from Microsoft to catch up in the streaming sector. ""Microsoft is trying to find new gaming revenue streams that go beyond selling hardware,â he said. In a statement following news of Blevinâs departure, Amazon said: ""Weâve loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that heâs accomplished for himself and his family and the gaming community. ""We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours."" _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

The event will see 200 actors recreate Peaky Blinders scenes live in the historic streets, warehouses and factories of Digbeth. There will also be fashion shows and a specially commissioned dance performance by renowned company Rambert. The line-up for the five music stages includes Mike Skinner aka The Streets and Anna Calvi, who scored the fifth series of Peaky Blinders, which starts on BBC One later in the year. Calvi worked on the score for the fifth series of the programme She said in a statement she was ""thrilled to be performing"", adding that the score was ""a major project for me this year and I'm excited to be bringing a special one-off version of my show to the festival"". Music has played a part in the show's success, withNick Cave's track Red Right Hand,externalplayed over the opening credits. ""There is some music that is Peaky and some music that isn't,"" said Knight. ""It's a bit of an intangible [thing], but just know when you hear it and so we put together bands that feel right. ""I've never been able to define why it is that sometimes you hear a beautiful Irish folk song sung in a really beautiful melodic way and it's still right. I think what connects all of those things is the words. The lyrics tease you into this slightly mystical, slightly dark, threatening place, which is where the Peakys live.""

We do know the new series will see Tommy struggling to balance the demands of a criminal empire with his new role as an MP, and features - as a new character - Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Fascist Party. The 1920s-set drama is shown in 83 countries around the world, and its popularity has led to unauthorised spin-offs like last year's unofficial festival anda theme bar in Manchester. But Knight said he had been ""absolutely heartened and thrilled by the response of Peaky fans"" who have made artwork and other tributes to the show on their own. ""We weren't doing anything, they were doing it themselves,"" he said. ""They've done incredible artwork and tattoos and graffiti on walls and it's been wonderful because it just means people have really responded to the show."" Shelby has puffed his way through more than 3,000 cigarettes What will be unchanged for Tommy Shelby in series five is his nicotine habit, Knight said. Murphy is estimated to have smoked more than 3,000 (herbal) cigarettes in the line of duty. Following a report that suggested that Netflix showed ""much more tobacco"" than on US TV or cable, the streaming service - which is not bound by traditional broadcasting rules -has pledged to cut backon how often smoking is shown in its original shows. The first four series of Peaky Blinders are available on Netflix, as well as on the BBC iPlayer in the UK. According to Knight, it's all about historical accuracy. ""The key is in the fact that we're trying to be as true to that world as possible, you know, and that's what people did,"" he said. ""People did smoke a lot in those days.

"This video can not be played Shock of no deal would be instant, says Mark Carney A no-deal Brexit would result in an instant shock to the UK economy, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned. Items such as petrol and food would become more expensive if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, he said. He predicted the value of the pound would fall in response to what he described as a ""real economic shock"". ""The change in trading relationship means that real incomes will be lower,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. But he rejected claims that the Bank's decision to cut growth forecasts was gloomy, after former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accused him of reviving ""project fear"". Mr Carney said ""you're hard pressed"" to describe the Bank's forecasts in that way. Faisal Islam: Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog Why the pound is getting weaker On Thursday,the Bank said the economy was expected to grow by 1.3% this year, lower than its earlier projection of 1.5%, if the UK leaves the EU with a deal. It did not say what it expected to happen in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Carney told the BBC there was a ""significant possibility"" that a deal would not be struck. ""The economics of no deal are that the rules of the game for exporting to Europe or importing from Europe fundamentally change,"" he said. As a result, he said, ""very big"" and ""highly profitable"" industries in the UK would become ""uneconomic"". Carmakers are among the firms that could be hardest hit, Mr Carney says. ""Very difficult decisions will need to be taken,"" he said, explaining that those would have a ""knock-on"" effect on the economy. He pointed to carmakers, food manufacturers and chemical firms as some of those that would be hardest hit. ""These are the sectors that have not been investing,"" he said. ""One of the reasons why the economy has slowed is that business investment has been very, very weak."" But Mr Carney said the Bank's response to a no-deal Brexit would not be automatic. He explained the Bank would look at the effect on the economy of things such as car plant closures as well as a weakening pound before it decided how to respond. ""We will do everything we can in order to provide support to the economy,"" he said. But he warned that a no-deal Brexit would be inflationary. ""Instantly, you have supply disruptions but you actually have businesses that are no longer economic."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility warnedthat a no-deal Brexit would deal a Â£29.3bn blow to the UK economy. In comments on the front page of Friday's Daily Telegraph, Brexit-backing Mr Duncan Smith renewed his criticism of Mr Carney. Ahead of the referendum in 2016,Mr Carney warned that the UK could fall into a recessionif it voted to leave the EU - something that did not happen. At the time, Mr Duncan Smith said the Bank of England governor needed to be ""very careful"" about making such comments. On Friday, Mr Duncan Smith called Mr Carney ""one of the architects and promoters of 'project fear'"". But speaking on the Today programme, Mr Carney said it was ""not helpful"" to deny that leaving ""the most integrated economic relationship in the world"" would have an impact on the economy.

"This video can not be played An RAF Chinook is dropping 400 tonnes of aggregate to shore up the dam and divert water Emergency crews are racing to save a damaged reservoir, as ""terrified"" residents fear their Derbyshire town could be flooded. Police say the wall holding back the 300-million-gallon Toddbrook Reservoir could still fail despite about 24 hours of efforts to shore it up. Part of the dam wall collapsed on Thursday afternoon. The 1,500people evacuated from Whaley Bridgeamid ""mortal danger"" warnings will not be allowed home tonight. But the water level has dropped by half a metre thanks to ten fire service pumps moving 4.2 million litres of water every hour - with more pumps on the way. An RAF helicopter is also halfway through dropping 400 tonnes of aggregate on the collapsed section. The clay under the slipway has been undermined Police, the Environment Agency, and the Canal and River Trust have all said there is a ""real risk"" the dam could collapse. Julie Sharman, from the Canal and Rivers Trust, said it was ""a critical situation"" but added the weather had improved and the water levels had reduced by 20cm. ""We aren't putting a figure on any risk of collapse but everything that can be done is being done,"" she said. Engineers are attempting to get the reservoir's water level down, to reduce pressure on the wall and allow repairs to begin. The dam holds back 1.3 million tonnes of water About 1,500 people left their homes after police told them to pack up their medication and pets and gather at an evacuation point. Some stayed with relatives while others bedded down in pubs and hotels, with lots of businesses offering free rooms. Police said residents would not be allowed back on Friday so would spend a second night away from their homes. Bev Goodwin has put up friends and family after they left Whaley Bridge Bev Goodwin lives in Chapel-en-le-Frith and put up her mum and dad, Joy and Steve and two friends - Susie and Angela. Joy said: ""We have nothing. No clothes, no toothbrush, nothing. ""We have been thinking about what's in our house that we would miss - all our kids' pictures and of our grandchildren - it's upsetting."" Latest updates on the battle to save the dam In pictures: Dam collapse 'Stalwart spirit' shown as dam town evacuated Susie said: ""It's just surreal that it's happening in our town, it's just bizarre."" Mike Breslin described it as a ""crazy situation"". ""They should never have built a school and a social club at the bottom of a dam. It's madness,"" he said. Resident Mike Breslin said it was 'madness' to build a school at the base of the dam Eric Baker, who has lived in the town for 30 years said: ""It's shocking really, it's like living next to a ticking bomb. If that goes the devastation will be unimaginable. ""We saw the water coming over at a tremendous rate on Wednesday and the park was flooded but it wasn't until Thursday the people who look after it started to look worried. ""Then it started to collapse on Thursday and it made a tremendous noise as the concrete slabs began to collapse. ""The disruption is huge, the small shops and businesses are really being hit and of course we don't know when it will be over."" Public agencies and the army have been praised for their efforts Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: ""We just fled. I managed to take my nightdress and we've got the tortoise in the washing up bowl in the car. ""It's quite terrifying. If the dam goes, it will take out the whole town."" Teams have worked through the night Nigel Carson, who lives near the dam, said he had been told it would take two or three days to reduce the reservoir to a safe level if it does not rain. There are no weather warnings in place for Friday, and the Met Office has said it expects much drier conditions. Heavy rain causes 'major damage' at stately home BBC reporter Richard Stead described the operation to fix the dam as ""a two-pronged attack"". He said: ""The Chinook is bringing aggregate on the one hand to shore up the dam, but also to divert water further up the valley away from the reservoir. ""There are also 16 high-volume pumps being used to relieve the pressure on the dam. ""Only when that is done can work start on permanent repairs and finding out what went wrong.""

This isn't the first time communities have faced the nightmare of a dam that could collapse. Back in 2007 a dam near Rotherham was the cause of a major alert, and the scenario is very similar to now. Torrential rain had filled the Ulley reservoir to overflowing. Cracks appeared in the dam itself. People downstream were told to leave. The M1 motorway was in the path of a potential burst so part of it was closed. As with the dam at Whaley Bridge, the one at Ulley was built in the 19th Century with the same combination of clay and mud. In the end, pumps relieved the pressure and nearly 3000 tonnes of rock strengthened the structure so the emergency passed. But over the following three years a huge repair operation costing Â£3.8m was needed. And a major review of the 2007 floods was highly critical of the way many of Britain's dams are monitored. Whatever happens at Whaley Bridge, questions will be asked about safety and whether ageing infrastructure can cope with the heavier downpours predicted as the climate warms. This video can not be played Toddbrook Reservoir: Footage shows fast-flowing water before collapse Part of the reservoir's spillway broke away on Thursday. It was damaged after large swathes of the country were battered by heavy rain and floods earlier in the week. Police told residents in Whaley Bridge to gather at Chapel High School in neighbouring Chapel-en-le-Frith. They were told to take pets and medication with them as it was unclear how long it would take to repair the damaged wall. Pumps from fire services across the country have been pumping out 7,000 litres of water a minute. Army engineers are clearing trees and bushes to get ""five or six"" more water pumps in on south side of reservoir. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service said more than 150 firefighters from across the UK have been supporting the work at the dam and in the town.

"More than Â£5m in unpaid tax was recovered from black market breeders and traders this year Reports of illegal puppy farming have risen almost five-fold in England in the last decade, figures suggest. The RSPCA said it received 4,357 calls in 2018 alerting it to potential cases in England, up from 890 in 2008. Rises were also recorded in Wales and Scotland. One animal welfare officer acknowledged the increased demand was partly driven by celebrity dogs on social media. A government spokesperson said stricter laws would come into effect in 2020. Illegal breeders can make millions of pounds rearing pups in dirty conditions, without food or water, the RSPCA said. Cases have involvedsick or dying puppies being soldto unsuspecting members of the public for hundreds of pounds each. The RSPCA also warned that dealers were renting out homes and inviting prospective dog owners to meet the puppies there, making it look as though the animals were being reared in clean, safe environments. Tax-dodging puppy farmers targeted by HMRC Two guilty of 'largest puppy farm' charges While the number of reports has risen steadily in England in the last decade, the number of dogs rescued from the puppy trade has stayed fairly flat in that time. In Wales the number of calls increased four-fold from 112 in 2008 to 452 in 2018. The Scottish SPCA does not hold figures for the past 10 years but said the number of puppy farming-related calls to its confidential helpline had increased by 31% from 2017 to 2018. Westie pups Ben and Max died just five days after they were bought online in Warwickshire 2015 The RSPCA's dog welfare expert Lisa Hens said it was ""distressing"" to see reports on the increase, but added that the rise could be attributed to people becoming ""more savvy"" about illegal trading. Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said black market dealers profited from offering puppies to take home immediately - compared with a months-long process of buying a puppy from a reputable breeder. When asked if hashtags such as#DogsOfInstagram,externalmight also be problematic for the campaign against illegal trading, Ch Supt Flynn said: ""Trends certainly contribute to demand. People see their favourite celebrity with a dog and they immediately want one."" Visit the puppy in the place it has been bred and reared Visit more than once Check the mum is interacting with the pups Search the dealer's contact number online to see if it is being used on numerous puppy adverts Be wary of breeders pressuring you into buying Fill out thePuppy Contract,external Contact the RSPCA, police or local council if you are concerned about something Sources: RSPCA and Puppy Contract The news comes as aparliamentary inquiry,externalinto puppy smuggling is launched. Defra figures suggest more than 300,000 dogs were brought into the UK in 2018 - and Dogs Trust believes many of these animals were pregnant when they were imported. The charity wants a change in legislation to protect dogs as well as potential owners. Puppy farm ban set to be confirmed Watch: What are conditions like inside a puppy farm? Paula Boyden, from Dogs Trust, said its investigations showed a lack of enforcement, meaning there was ""no real deterrent"" for smugglers. She said dealers capitalised on the ""huge demand"" for breeds such as French bulldogs and dachshunds. Max had to have treatment costing Â£5,600 when he fell sick just hours after a family in West Sussex bought him from a dealer Defra said tougher licensing conditions and aban on the third party sale of puppiesand kittens from April 2020 would help to stamp out the ""appalling trade"". Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, welcomed the ban but said more could be done to tackle ""this terrible trade"".

"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. The duty is likely target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the US move. ""Adding tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions, it's not the correct way,"" Mr Wang said on the sidelines of a meeting of South East Asian ministers in Bangkok. Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai. US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: Caught in the crossfire He also attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.

In later remarks, the US president told reporters the 10% tariff was a short-term measure and that tariffs could be lifted further in stages to more than 25%. ""Somebody should have done this with China a long time ago,"" he added. This video can not be played At the end of June, Mr Trump said the US wasn't about to add any new tariffs on Chinese goods The move jolted financial markets as Washington and Beijing had described this week's trade negotiations as constructive, and scheduled another round of talks for September. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones share index closed down 1.1%, and Asia markets were sharply lower on Friday. Oil prices tumbled. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties come amid mounting concern over how effective Mr Trump's strategy is proving to be. On Thursday, Mr Trump's former chief economic adviser,Gary Cohn, said in a BBC interviewthat the tariff battle was having a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment. This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war The resulting tensions have also influencedthe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Fed chair Jerome Powell said it was not the central bank's job to criticise US trade policy, but added that trade tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June. Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea. China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Over the past year, both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war which has rattled investors and cast a shadow over the global economy.

"This video can not be played Did the Liberal Democrats play ""dirty"" to win the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election? The Liberal Democrats have won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, leaving new PM Boris Johnson with a working majority in Parliament of one. Jane Dodds overturned an 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. Mr Davies stood again after being unseated by a petition following hisconviction for a false expenses claim. It was the first electoral test for Mr Johnson just eight days after becoming prime minister. What does the result tell us? By-election as it unfolded It was also the quickest by-election defeat for any new prime minister since World War Two. Now, with the thinnest majority, he will have to rely heavily on the support of his own MPs and hisconfidence-and-supply partners the DUPto get any legislation passed in key votes. This video can not be played Jane Dodds said the voters had chosen ""hope over fear"" It was a bad night for Labour, whose vote share dropped by 12.4% as it was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit Party. The result means the Lib Dems now have 13 MPs. Ms Dodds, who is the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""My very first act as your new MP when I get to Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he's hiding, and tell him to stop playing with the future of our community and rule out a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Davies congratulated Ms Dodds saying ""I wish her well for the future"" and paid tribute to his family saying they had ""a difficult time over the past few months"". The turnout was 59.6%, down from 74.6% at the general election, but it is the highest for a by-election since Winchester in 1997. Neither Plaid Cymru nor the Greens fielded candidates, to try to maximise the Remain vote. Tory party chairman James Cleverly toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme it was a ""very close result in a by-election in which the Lib Dems were expected to romp home comfortably"". In a message to Conservative MPs concerned about the government's Brexit policy he said the new prime minister had received a ""clear mandate from parliamentarians"" and an ""even more thumping victory in the leadership election"". ""I do think it's incumbent on all Conservatives to support the prime minister in what has been a long-standing Conservative policy,"" he said. But recently-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Boris Johnson's shrinking majority makes it clear that he has no mandate to crash us out of the EU."" She denied the party had ""played"" the system by striking a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I want to have a different voting system but we're working within the system that we have,"" she said. New Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Celebrating victory later on Friday morning with party activists, Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""winning again"" and she would ""fight to keep our country in the European Union"". Ms Dodds, 55, lives in the neighbouring mid Wales constituency of Montgomeryshire and is a child-protection social worker. The Lib Dems have held the rural seat for all but nine of the last 34 years and lost at the 2015 general election. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""spirit of co-operation"" between the pro-Remain parties had led to Ms Dodds's election, as he called for another EU referendum. ""But if the prime minister is intent on a general election, he should know that Plaid Cymru and the other pro-Remain parties are committed to cooperating so that we beat Brexit once and for all,"" he said. Wales Green Party leader Anthony Slaughter said its decision to withdraw from the by-election was ""absolutely vindicated"" by the result. ""The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson's majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the result ""disappointing"". He added: ""The Liberal Democrats won it after doing a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I think that a lot of voters were determined to get rid of the Conservative, and they voted accordingly. So we were squeezed, but it's a place we have not held for a very long time. The area has changed a bit."" Prof Laura McAllister, from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, said the result should not be read as a ""resounding victory"" for Remain. She pointed out that the three Brexit-supporting parties had 2-3,000 votes more than the Remain alliance. But she added: ""There are always nuanced undercurrents to this. The reality is Brexit isn't the only issue people were voting on. ""People were probably voting on rural and local issues. We can never categorically say this was about Brexit."" Jo Swinson: ""I will fight to keep our country in the European Union"" Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives were enjoying a ""Boris bounce"" and the result was encouraging for the party despite the loss. But he added: ""In an early general election, at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing."" He said the Lib Dems could pick up 40 or 50 seats, which would make winning a large overall majority ""rather more difficult for the Conservatives"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent As the ballots were counted, the candidates looked on - neither the Tories nor the Liberal Democrats dared to claim victory or concede defeat. One thing was certain, the result when it came would be close. But a win is a win and the Lib Dems will shout this from the rooftops as proof they can cut through with an anti-Brexit message. The Remain alliance proved to be a winning formula, as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party stood aside to give the Lib Dems a clear run against the Tories. If the Brexit Party hadn't been standing, the Conservatives might have clinched it. Labour will look hard at its disastrous result and wonder what might have been with a clearer message on Brexit. And for the Tories, the people of Brecon and Radnorshire have delivered an unwelcome verdict on their former MP and the new prime minister. Boris Johnson's hands were already tied in parliament and the ropes around his wrists have just been pulled a little tighter. Why does this by-election matter? Who were the candidates? A look back at the 1985 by-election At one stage Labour feared it might lose its deposit and blamed voters switching tactically to the Lib Dems. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""We always knew this was going to be a difficult night for us, but we're proud of our positive campaign in Brecon and Radnorshire."" ""One thing is clear - voters have rejected Boris Johnson and his divisive, out-of-touch UK Tory government."" Chris Davies said his family had been through a difficult time over the past few months Political analyst Prof Roger Awan-Scully, from Cardiff University, said: ""Labour need to look very closely at this result. Everything points to not just tactical voting for the Lib Dems but also dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn and [First Minister] Mark Drakeford."" The Brexit Party's Des Parkinson, a retired police chief superintendent, who finished third, said: ""If you look at the actual total of the vote, the Brexiteers won. ""It shows where the votes are but the prime minister has to deliver a clear Brexit... if he doesn't, then his government is in dire trouble."" The Monster Raving Loony Party pushed the UKIP candidate into sixth place. Voters have also given their thoughts on the result. Farmer Trevor Walters voted for Mr Davies and said the Tories might have won, had the Brexit Party not stood, but called the speculation over a Brexit no-deal fallout ""scaremongering"". He added: ""We're not going to be left in the lurch. I don't think for one second that'll happen. Something will be done to sweeten the blow of all that and get us engaged with a proper trade deal.""

"Voters go to the polls in Brecon and Radnorshire on Thursday in the second Welsh by-election this year - and the first electoral test for new PM Boris Johnson. The poll was triggered when a recall petition unseated the incumbent Conservative MP Chris Davies after he was convicted of a false expenses claim. There are six candidates in the race, competing for the attention of around 53,000 voters in the predominantly rural constituency - geographically the largest in Wales. Des Parkinson says Parliament ""just can't make its mind up"" on Brexit Des Parkinson, 71, is a retired Dyfed-Powys Police chief superintendent who has worked for the party's Welsh MEP Nathan Gill in the past. The by-election is the first Westminster test in Wales for the new Brexit Party, which came top in the EU elections in Wales and across Great Britain in May. Founded by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, the organisation has attracted many former UKIP activists. Mr Parkinson told BBC Wales that the Brexit Party wants to ""change politics for good"", claiming that since the referendum there has been indecision, discussion and votes. ""Parliament just can't make its mind up,"" he says. The Brexit Party candidate is opposed to the withdrawal agreement made by former prime minister Theresa May, calling it ""disastrous"" and the ""worst deal in British history where we would give Â£39bn to the EU and get nothing in return, other than more uncertainty"". He said the UK government should prepare for no-deal with the EU - ""otherwise you don't get a decent deal"" - suggesting that leaving with the EU without a deal would cause ""some disruption"" but ""over a period of time things would balance out and deals would be done"". Mr Parkinson wants council tax rises in Powys reversed and is also opposed to the expansion of wind farms. Chris Davies was the third MP to face a recall petition Chris Davies, 51, was an auctioneer before he became an MP in 2015. He also ran a veterinary group in the constituency. In the by-election, Mr Davies is fighting for his political life - after winning re-election in 2017, he was unseated by a recall petition triggered by his conviction for a false expenses claim. He had pleaded guilty to the charge after trying to split the cost of Â£700 worth of pictures between two office budgets by creating fake invoices, when he could have claimed the amount by other means. Mr Davies has apologised, saying: ""If you look at the technicality here there was no financial gain. ""Clearly the authorities have been through my accounts and everything I've done with a fine-tooth comb over the last four years, and that was the only mistake they could find,"" he added. Losing the election would mean the Conservatives - who have been struggling and often failing to command majorities in key votes - would be in an even weaker position in the Commons. Mr Davies is emphasising his local credentials in his bid to hold the seat after being re-selected by local Tories to be their candidate.  ""I understand the farming community, I've worked in it all my life,"" he said. He said he was not ""frightened"" of a no-deal Brexit, although he'd rather see an agreement on the UK's leaving of the European Union.  He voted for Theresa May's withdrawal agreement every time it had been put to MPs. Mr Davies also claimed he was the only candidate who would be able to work ""closely"" with new PM Boris Johnson. Tom Davies says there is an appetite for a ""socialist option"" on the ballot paper Tom Davies, 29, lives in Brecon where he was born and is currently working for a legal team in a private company based in Cwmbran. His party has come third in the last two Westminster elections in Brecon and Radnorshire, behind the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Davies has already had a taste of electoral politics as a member of Brecon Town Council. ""We need to ensure we are protecting the communities around Brecon and Radnorshire from the Tory austerity policies, and protect them from Tory Brexit policies,"" he said. ""[They] look like they are going to be seriously damaging for Wales as a whole and indeed Brecon and Radnorshire, in terms of agricultural sectors and businesses around the area."" The Labour candidate claimed hard-working families were being pushed to the brink, saying: ""We are seeing more people relying on food banks."" Mr Davies has said he supports a ""final-say confirmatory referendum"" on Brexit and would campaign to remain in the EU, in line with the policy of First Minister Mark Drakeford. Rejecting any question that Labour could, like Plaid Cymru, have stood aside to give the Liberal Democrats a clear run, Mr Davies said there was ""clearly an appetite for Labour in Brecon and Radnorshire and a socialist option on the ballot"". Jane Dodds says she is ""absolutely opposed to a damaging no-deal Brexit"" Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds is a child-protection social worker. She lives in Welshpool, in the neighbouring constituency of Montgomeryshire, with her husband Patrick. The by-election is important for the Lib Dems - in a seat which was formerly a Lib Dem stronghold and in a nation where there are no Lib Dem MPs. Winning would be an early scalp for the Liberal Democrats' new leader Jo Swinson too. Ms Dodds said her campaign was focusing on local issues, ""making sure we have basic services, such as banks and good broadband"". ""It's about supporting our farmers and our agriculture - that we have good services and we have the opportunity for our children and young people to remain in mid Wales through affordable housing and through good well paid jobs,"" she said. Remaining in the EU was a central plank of the Lib Dem campaign in the EU elections, but Ms Dodds said the by-election ""isn't about changing Brexit"", claiming residents were ""fed-up"" with the issue. ""I am absolutely opposed to a damaging no-deal Brexit,"" she said, warning it will significantly hit farmers. However, pressed further, Ms Dodds said: ""We are a pro-European party and we want any deal to be put to the people in a people's vote."" Liz Phillips claims UKIP was the party which secured the referendum on Europe Liz Phillips is a personal assistant to former UKIP leader Gerard Batten. She currently lives in Kent, but said she had lived for a long time in the Radnorshire town of Rhayader. She said she had five points of attack - ""making Brexit happen"", ""scrapping the Welsh Assembly"", opposing windfarms, ""binning the BBC licence fee"" and ensuring Brecon and Radnorshire ""is firmly put on the tourist map"". Ms Phillips accused UKIP's main rival, the Brexit Party, of being ""only a party in name"", claiming that unlike UKIP, it does not offer people full membership. ""UKIP was the party that brought about the referendum and is the one that stayed firm all the way through,"" she said. ""No flopping between different parties, no going back to the Conservatives. UKIP is still there,"" Ms Phillips added. She said she would like to see a Brexit ""where we are completely out of the clutches of the European Union"". ""If this means no deal, so be it,"" she said. ""This country can survive quite happily and did for many, many hundreds of years without any interference from the EU."" Lady Lily The Pink says she offers a way for voters to say they want ""none of the above"" Lady Lily The Pink is the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate for the by-election. She said a vote for her was ""the only way to say 'I want none of the above'"". ""Like a large proportion of the electorate I'm angry,"" she said in a statement, ""angry at the failings, the loopholes and the all-too-often self-serving system of governance we currently have"". ""I'm not a real politician.  I'm not even a real Lady, I am however a real Loony - and I'm using comedy, satire and fancy dress in an attempt to get us all heard. ""I'm standing - sitting, slouching, occasionally leaning - in this by-election campaign to give voice to those who have the right to vote yet who feel there is no point in voting.""

"This video can not be played Did the Liberal Democrats play ""dirty"" to win the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election? The Liberal Democrats have won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, leaving new PM Boris Johnson with a working majority in Parliament of one. Jane Dodds overturned an 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. Mr Davies stood again after being unseated by a petition following hisconviction for a false expenses claim. It was the first electoral test for Mr Johnson just eight days after becoming prime minister. What does the result tell us? By-election as it unfolded It was also the quickest by-election defeat for any new prime minister since World War Two. Now, with the thinnest majority, he will have to rely heavily on the support of his own MPs and hisconfidence-and-supply partners the DUPto get any legislation passed in key votes. This video can not be played Jane Dodds said the voters had chosen ""hope over fear"" It was a bad night for Labour, whose vote share dropped by 12.4% as it was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit Party. The result means the Lib Dems now have 13 MPs. Ms Dodds, who is the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""My very first act as your new MP when I get to Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he's hiding, and tell him to stop playing with the future of our community and rule out a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Davies congratulated Ms Dodds saying ""I wish her well for the future"" and paid tribute to his family saying they had ""a difficult time over the past few months"". The turnout was 59.6%, down from 74.6% at the general election, but it is the highest for a by-election since Winchester in 1997. Neither Plaid Cymru nor the Greens fielded candidates, to try to maximise the Remain vote. Tory party chairman James Cleverly toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme it was a ""very close result in a by-election in which the Lib Dems were expected to romp home comfortably"". In a message to Conservative MPs concerned about the government's Brexit policy he said the new prime minister had received a ""clear mandate from parliamentarians"" and an ""even more thumping victory in the leadership election"". ""I do think it's incumbent on all Conservatives to support the prime minister in what has been a long-standing Conservative policy,"" he said. But recently-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Boris Johnson's shrinking majority makes it clear that he has no mandate to crash us out of the EU."" She denied the party had ""played"" the system by striking a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I want to have a different voting system but we're working within the system that we have,"" she said. New Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Celebrating victory later on Friday morning with party activists, Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""winning again"" and she would ""fight to keep our country in the European Union"". Ms Dodds, 55, lives in the neighbouring mid Wales constituency of Montgomeryshire and is a child-protection social worker. The Lib Dems have held the rural seat for all but nine of the last 34 years and lost at the 2015 general election. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""spirit of co-operation"" between the pro-Remain parties had led to Ms Dodds's election, as he called for another EU referendum. ""But if the prime minister is intent on a general election, he should know that Plaid Cymru and the other pro-Remain parties are committed to cooperating so that we beat Brexit once and for all,"" he said. Wales Green Party leader Anthony Slaughter said its decision to withdraw from the by-election was ""absolutely vindicated"" by the result. ""The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson's majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the result ""disappointing"". He added: ""The Liberal Democrats won it after doing a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I think that a lot of voters were determined to get rid of the Conservative, and they voted accordingly. So we were squeezed, but it's a place we have not held for a very long time. The area has changed a bit."" Prof Laura McAllister, from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, said the result should not be read as a ""resounding victory"" for Remain. She pointed out that the three Brexit-supporting parties had 2-3,000 votes more than the Remain alliance. But she added: ""There are always nuanced undercurrents to this. The reality is Brexit isn't the only issue people were voting on. ""People were probably voting on rural and local issues. We can never categorically say this was about Brexit."" Jo Swinson: ""I will fight to keep our country in the European Union"" Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives were enjoying a ""Boris bounce"" and the result was encouraging for the party despite the loss. But he added: ""In an early general election, at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing."" He said the Lib Dems could pick up 40 or 50 seats, which would make winning a large overall majority ""rather more difficult for the Conservatives"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent As the ballots were counted, the candidates looked on - neither the Tories nor the Liberal Democrats dared to claim victory or concede defeat. One thing was certain, the result when it came would be close. But a win is a win and the Lib Dems will shout this from the rooftops as proof they can cut through with an anti-Brexit message. The Remain alliance proved to be a winning formula, as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party stood aside to give the Lib Dems a clear run against the Tories. If the Brexit Party hadn't been standing, the Conservatives might have clinched it. Labour will look hard at its disastrous result and wonder what might have been with a clearer message on Brexit. And for the Tories, the people of Brecon and Radnorshire have delivered an unwelcome verdict on their former MP and the new prime minister. Boris Johnson's hands were already tied in parliament and the ropes around his wrists have just been pulled a little tighter. Why does this by-election matter? Who were the candidates? A look back at the 1985 by-election At one stage Labour feared it might lose its deposit and blamed voters switching tactically to the Lib Dems. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""We always knew this was going to be a difficult night for us, but we're proud of our positive campaign in Brecon and Radnorshire."" ""One thing is clear - voters have rejected Boris Johnson and his divisive, out-of-touch UK Tory government."" Chris Davies said his family had been through a difficult time over the past few months Political analyst Prof Roger Awan-Scully, from Cardiff University, said: ""Labour need to look very closely at this result. Everything points to not just tactical voting for the Lib Dems but also dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn and [First Minister] Mark Drakeford."" The Brexit Party's Des Parkinson, a retired police chief superintendent, who finished third, said: ""If you look at the actual total of the vote, the Brexiteers won. ""It shows where the votes are but the prime minister has to deliver a clear Brexit... if he doesn't, then his government is in dire trouble."" The Monster Raving Loony Party pushed the UKIP candidate into sixth place. Voters have also given their thoughts on the result. Farmer Trevor Walters voted for Mr Davies and said the Tories might have won, had the Brexit Party not stood, but called the speculation over a Brexit no-deal fallout ""scaremongering"". He added: ""We're not going to be left in the lurch. I don't think for one second that'll happen. Something will be done to sweeten the blow of all that and get us engaged with a proper trade deal."" Independent book shop owner Emma Corfield-Walters, who backed the Lib Dems, said: ""None of us know what's going to happen in the future. ""I think we're all entirely confused on the Brexit issue and I think this result shows us.""

"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. The duty is likely target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the US move. ""Adding tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions, it's not the correct way,"" Mr Wang said on the sidelines of a meeting of South East Asian ministers in Bangkok. Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai.

In later remarks, the US president told reporters the 10% tariff was a short-term measure and that tariffs could be lifted further in stages to more than 25%. ""Somebody should have done this with China a long time ago,"" he added. This video can not be played At the end of June, Mr Trump said the US wasn't about to add any new tariffs on Chinese goods The move jolted financial markets as Washington and Beijing had described this week's trade negotiations as constructive, and scheduled another round of talks for September. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones share index closed down 1.1%, and Asia markets were sharply lower on Friday. Oil prices tumbled. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties come amid mounting concern over how effective Mr Trump's strategy is proving to be. On Thursday, Mr Trump's former chief economic adviser,Gary Cohn, said in a BBC interviewthat the tariff battle was having a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment. This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war The resulting tensions have also influencedthe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Fed chair Jerome Powell said it was not the central bank's job to criticise US trade policy, but added that trade tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June. Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea. China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Over the past year, both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war which has rattled investors and cast a shadow over the global economy.
