"The prime minister has vowed to focus on ""levelling up the country"" and ""spreading opportunity"", after securing the post-Brexit trade deal this week. Boris Johnson told theSunday Telegraph,externalthe deal would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to ""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests to reach the agreement. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Meanwhile, Tesco chairman John Allan told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend he expected the impact on food prices to be ""very modest indeed"". The agreement wasreached on Christmas Eveafter months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December. Scrutiny of the treaty began in earnest on Saturday morning when the 1,246-page document was officiallypublished,external, with Conservative Eurosceptics among those promising to pore over the details. In his first interview since the deal was agreed, Mr Johnson said ""big changes"" were coming, declaring ""it is up to us now to seize the opportunity of Brexit"". He said a ""great government effort"" had gone into the plans, with animal welfare, data and chemicals being areas where the UK could diverge from EU standards. ""This government has a very clear agenda to use this moment to unite and level up and to spread opportunity across the government,"" Mr Johnson added. But he told the Telegraph that the deal ""perhaps does not go as far as we would like"" on financial services. From the end of the transition period on 31 December, financial firms including banks and insurers will not be granted automatic access to EU markets. They will have to be deemed by Brussels to be governed by rules as robust as within the bloc. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 SNP MPs to vote against Brexit trade deal Chancellor Rishi Sunak has sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". ""There is a stable, co-operative framework, mentioned in the deal which I think will give people that reassurance that we will remain in close dialogue with our European partners when it comes to things like equivalence decisions, for example,"" he said. The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses. He said the ""comprehensive nature"" of the free trade agreement ensured ""tariff-free, quota-free, access for British businesses to the European market"", and protected British jobs. The chancellor says he wants to make the City of London ""the most attractive place to list new companies"" But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the agreement did not protect financial services, which employ a million people in the UK. ""This is a thin deal,"" she told the BBC. ""It's not the deal that the government promised and there are large areas of our economy, for example  financial services - that employs one in 14 people in our country - where there aren't clear elements within this deal. ""Much more work will need to be done very speedily by the Conservative government in order to ensure that we keep jobs in the UK as a result of this deal and don't lose even more."" But she said her party would support the deal in next week's vote in order to provide legal certainty for businesses. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also criticised the agreement, saying it was ""threadbare"" and ""bad for jobs, business, security, and our environment"". The agreement will bring ""long delays and higher costs"" because trade with the EU ""will now be wrapped in red tape"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackfordsaid the deal was a ""disaster for Scotland""because it will ""rip us out of the world's largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape"". The SNP's MPs will vote against the deal, he said. In his article, the prime minister said the deal could withstand the ""most ruthless scrutiny"" from the European Research Group of Conservative Brexiteers. The group has assembled a self-styled ""star chamber"" of lawyers led by veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash to examine the full text ahead of a Commons vote. Senior Conservative backbencher Sir Bill said ""sovereignty is the key issue"" as his team analysed the small print of the deal. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? Tesco chairman John Allan told BBC Radio 4's World this Weekend that overall the post-Brexit agreement with the EU was a ""good outcome, certainly far better than having no deal"". ""There'll be a little bit more administration associated with importing as well as exporting,"" he said. ""But, in absolute terms, I think that will hardly be felt in terms of the prices that consumers are paying."" But the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisation (NFFO) accused Mr Johnson of having ""bottled it"" on fishing quotas to secure only ""a fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law"". The National Federation of Fishermen's' Organisation accused Mr Johnson of having ""bottled it"" on fishing quotas Barrie Deas, chief executive of the NFFO, said Mr Johnson had ""sacrificed"" fishing to other priorities, after the subject proved to be an enduring sticking point during negotiations. ""Lacking legal, moral or political negotiating leverage on fish, the EU made the whole trade deal contingent on a UK surrender on fisheries,"" Mr Deas said. What does the deal mean for fishing? Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve Senior UK negotiators have admitted to compromising ""somewhat"" over fish, although they say the EU also made concessions. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accused the government of having ""sold out Scottish fishing all over again"", adding: ""Promises they knew couldn't be delivered, duly broken."" The share of fish in British waters that the UK can catch will rise from about half now to two-thirds by the end of the five-and-a-half-year transition. After this, the UK would be free to reduce EU access to its coastal waters further but could face retaliatory action. Government sources have said any measures taken by the EU would have to be proportionate and would be limited to the fishing industry. Meanwhile, the EU's 27 member states indicated they will within days give their formal backing to the deal, which covers about Â£660bn of trade to allow goods to be sold without tariffs or quotas in the EU market.

"South Africa is seeing a steady increase in cases driven by the new coronavirus variant South Africa has become the first country on the continent to register more than one million Covid-19 cases. It comes just days after authorities confirmed that a new, faster-spreading, coronavirus variant had been detected. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. President Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to announce tougher restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further. The latest milestone was announced on Sunday by South Africa's Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize. The country has now confirmed 1,004,413 Covid-19 infections and 26,735 deaths since the outbreak began in March. Last week, South Africa recorded a daily average of 11,700 new infections - a rise of 39% on the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday, the daily number of new cases was above 14,000. A new coronavirus variant - known as 501.V2 - is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country. Coronavirus variants: The science explained UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon Earlier this week,the UK banned travel from South Africabecause of the new variant.Another new Covid variant has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells, but appear unrelated to each other. Hospitals and clinics in South Africa are under strain as the numbers of new cases rise After South Africa, the worst hit country on the African continent is Morocco, which has seen 432,079 cases and 7,240 deaths. They are followed by Egypt with 131,315 cases and 7,352 deaths and Tunisia with 130,230 infections and 4,426 deaths. In other Covid developments around the world: The ambulance service in the UK capital, London, received as many emergency calls on Saturday as it did at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, the BBC has learned. The new variant is said to be the cause of the increased demand Japanimposeda ban on most non-resident foreign nationals entering the country,externalfollowing confirmation of its first cases of the new variant that emerged in the UK. The ban will remain in place until at least the end of January.

"Any changes to food prices after Brexit are likely to be ""very modest indeed"" under the deal struck between the UK and the EU, the chairman of Tesco has said. John Allan told the BBC that it would ""hardly be felt in terms of the prices that consumers are paying"". He said the deal was a ""good outcome"" and far better than no deal. But he said the main benefit was that it removes a distraction from business and government. When reports last month suggested that there might not be a post-Brexit trade deal, Mr Allan had warned that food prices could rise between 3% and 5%. But he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the deal agreed this week meant any noticeable changes in food costs for consumers were unlikely. Brexit 'could see people choose cheddar over brie' Could Brexit make your food shop more expensive? Britons told not to stockpile food ahead of January ""The tariffs were the things that were going to generate the price increases,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the deal ensures ""tariff-free"" trade between the UK and EU. Mr Allan said: ""There'll be a little bit more administration associated with importing and exporting. But in absolute terms, I think that will hardly be felt in terms of the prices the consumers are paying."" He said UK companies would be able to cope with the additional work involved in the customs regime, with the possible exception of some small businesses. But 70% of small businesses only trading with the EU, and not further afield, many of them may be dealing with customs paperwork for the first time, Mr Allan warned. If the deal had not been struck, the Tesco chairman had previously suggestedBrexit might change what Britons eat, as the prices of imported food such as brie cheese could have risen by up to 40%. But Mr Allan suggested that Brexit would now only have a ""marginal effect"" on what shoppers put in their trolleys. The deal should also make it easier for businesses to cope with some of thenew customs issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Allan said he was confident the deal ""will not obstruct our ability to keep our NI supermarkets supplied"". ""All the detail is not clear, but we were well set up, even if there was no deal, to continue to supply our NI supermarkets,"" he said. ""I think that will be even easier now."" Any change to ""intra-Ireland"" trade, including agricultural businesses that operate north and south of the border, would be ""marginal"", he said. John Allan was appointed Tesco chairman in March 2015 Mr Allan said he did not see any major advantages to the supermarket industry of any new freedoms as a result leaving the EU, however. ""Certainly Tesco - and I assume our competitors - we're very keen to maintain food standards,"" he said. ""We won't be seeking food from other countries that have different and potentially lower food standards than us, so I don't think it's going to make any material difference."" He suggested the main benefit to the UK government and business would be the removal of Brexit as ""a major distraction"" as the country tries to recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. ""It should enable us to address the challenges and opportunities our economy has got in a much more full-blooded way,"" Mr Allan said.

"This video can not be played Watch the aftermath of the explosion in Nashville Police investigating a camper van blast that injured three people in Nashville on Christmas Day have named a suspect after DNA was collected at the scene. Officials in the US state of Tennessee said the DNA matched that of Anthony Quinn Warner, 63. Investigators believe that the blast was likely a suicide bombing. On Sunday, the FBI said there was no indication of additional suspects involved and that it was too early to suggest a motive. The blast outside a telecoms office disrupted communications systems in Tennessee and four other states. Officers responded to reports of gunshots just before 06:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on 25 December in an area of the city known for its restaurants and nightlife. Shortly afterwards, they found a camper van broadcasting a warning message to leave the area. Police saidthe van had also broadcast the 1964 hit song Downtown,externalby British singer Petula Clark, the Tennessean newspaper reported. The van exploded a few minutes later, the force of the blast knocking an officer off their feet, police said. The powerful explosion damaged buildings and felled trees The vehicle blew up outside a building belonging to the telecoms giant AT&T, which also occupies an office tower nearby. Buildings suffered structural damage, windows were blown out, and trees were felled. Videos posted on social media showed water from damaged pipes running down walls as alarms howled in the background. Police emergency systems were knocked out across Tennessee. Telephone, internet and fibre optic TV services were also disrupted in Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia, according to AT&T. Police later released this image of the van arriving at the scene early on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Steve Schmoldt, who lived next door to Warner for more than two decades, described him as ""friendly"" and ""low key"", adding: ""I guess some people would say he's a little odd."" ""You never saw anyone come and go,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""As far as we knew, he was kind of a computer geek that worked at home."" Mr Schmoldt said Warner gave no indication of having held strong political beliefs. ""He never had any yard signs or flags in his window or anything like that,"" he said.

"Flooding in India this year was linked to a very heavy Monsoon The world continued to pay a very high price for extreme weather in 2020, according to a report from the charity Christian Aid. Against a backdrop of climate change, itsstudy,externallists 10 events that saw thousands of lives lost and major insurance costs. Six of the events took place in Asia, with floods in China and India causing damages of more than $40bn. In the US, record hurricanes and wildfires caused some $60bn in losses. 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmest Have countries kept their climate change promises? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk While the world has been struggling to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic, millions of people have also had to cope with the impacts of extreme weather events. Christian Aid's list of ten storms, floods and fires all cost at least $1.5bn - with nine of the 10 costing at least $5bn. Anunusually rainy monsoon seasonwas associated with some of the most damaging storms in Asia, where some of the biggest losses were. Over a period of months, heavy flooding in India saw more than 2,000 deaths with millions of people displaced from their homes. The value of the insured losses is estimated at $10bn. Chinasuffered even greater financial damage from flooding, running to around $32bn between June and October this year. The loss of life from these events was much smaller than in India. While these were slow-moving disasters, some events did enormous damage in a short period of time. Cyclone Amphanstruck the Bay of Bengal in Mayand caused losses estimated at $13bn in just a few days. ""We saw record temperatures in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, straddling between 30C-33C,"" said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. ""These high temperatures had the characteristics of marine heat waves that might have led to the rapid intensification of the pre-monsoon cyclones Amphan and Nisarga,"" he said in a comment on the Christian Aid study. ""Amphan was one of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon season."" Africa was also on the receiving end of extreme events, withmassive locust swarmsruining crops and vegetation to the tune of $8.5bn. Locust swarms ruined crops in parts of Africa, causing huge financial losses The UN haslinked these swarms,externalto climate change, with unusually heavy rains in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa in recent years contributing to the locust outbreaks. Europe also saw significant impacts when Storm Ciaraswept throughIreland, the UK and several other countries in February. It resulted in 14 lives being lost and damages of $2.7bn. Christian Aid stress that these figures for financial costs are likely an underestimate as they are based only on insured losses. Richer countries have more valuable properties, and on the whole suffer greater financial penalties from extreme events. Firefighters in the UK had to rescue a stranded driver whose car got stuck in floodwater during Storm Ciara But financial losses don't convey the full impact of these storms and fires. While South Sudan'sfloodsweren't among the costliest in dollar terms, they have had a huge impact, killing 138 people and wiping out this year's crops. Researchers say that the influence of climate change on extreme events is strong and likely to continue growing. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains what the coronavirus pandemic has done for climate ""Just like 2019 before it, 2020 has been full of disastrous extremes,"" said Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, from the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia. ""We have seen all this with a 1C of global average temperature rise, highlighting the sensitive relationship between average conditions and extremes."" Fires raged in many parts of the western US across 2020 ""Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not averaged changes."" ""Unfortunately, we can expect more years to look like 2020 - and worse - as global temperatures creep higher."" While 2021 is likely to bring a similar story of losses from extreme events, there is some sense of optimism that political leaders may be on the brink of taking steps that might help the world avoid the worst excesses of rising temperatures. ""It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this climate change tide,"" said report author, Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. ""With President-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.""

"Clinicians are warning health services could be overwhelmed by any surge in coronavirus cases after restrictions were temporarily eased at Christmas. The Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties also said the new faster spreading strain of the virus could create a ""perfect storm"". They warned it could take months for vaccinations to alleviate pressure on the ""severely stretched"" system. However Scotland's clinical director denied the system could be overwhelmed. Prof Jason Leitch said measures were already in place to increase capacity where it was needed. But the Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties, which includes anaesthetists, GPs and surgeons, said the short term situation for the NHS remained ""bleak"", despite hope from the vaccine. Mainland Scotland moves into level four lockdown NHS staff in Scotland 'facing perfect storm' When will I be vaccinated against Covid? The warning comes a day after the Scottish government put mainland Scotland into level four restrictions in response to thenew more transmissible strain of coronavirus. Latest Scottish government figures,externalshowed on Sunday that 740 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported across the country. In Dumfries and Galloway health officials said they feared the new strain could be driving a ""rapid increase"" in infections in the area after64 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Wigtownshire. While reports have indicated theOxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be approved within days, the academy said restrictions would still be needed for some time. In a statement they said: ""We know there is hope on the horizon with the rollout of a national immunisation programme, with further vaccines likely to be approved shortly. ""However, it will take months for this to make a significant difference, and the short-term situation facing our NHS and public health services remains bleak."" They said the NHS and social care services across Scotland were now on an emergency footing and while work had been done to reduce infection rates, the new strain of the virus would add pressure in the days and weeks ahead. ""We are gravely concerned that this could lead to the NHS being overwhelmed,"" the organisation said. They called on the public to recognise the severity of the situation and take the necessary steps to support health and social care services. ""Our general practices are exceptionally busy and our hospitals are already near capacity. We risk facing a perfect storm of challenges if we don't take collective action now to prevent further spread of Covid-19."" But Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, denied the system faced being overwhelmed. He told the BBC: ""We're not at risk of overwhelming the health care system. ""But it's not quite as simple as a 'yes no' answer, because we can double, treble, quadruple our care for Covid - the number of beds, the number of intensive care beds - we can absolutely do that. We're ready for it, we have plans for it. ""But you can't do that at no cost to other elements of the health service. ""We don't have a spare thousand doctors and nurses just standing by waiting to do something, so if we have to do more intensive care for Covid, which I really hope we don't, then we will have to take away from somewhere else."" Prof Leitch said efforts had been made to maintain as much of the health service as possible, with hopes that elective surgeries would continue right through the winter. But he added: ""The reality is, depending on what happens over the next couple of weeks, we may have to cut back some of that in order to make room for Covid care."" The Scottish government said it was working closely with health boards to ensure the NHS was prepared for additional pressures. A spokeswoman said: ""Our winter planning process includes assessing our readiness across all aspects of health and care, including Test and Protect, vaccinations, PPE supplies and the maintenance of essential services, including urgent and emergency. ""As part of the specific response to Covid-19, boards will maintain the ability to double their ICU capacity within one week, treble in two weeks and, if required, extend this to over 700 in total across Scotland. In addition, to support this, over 60 ICU and supportive care medicines, as well as supplies of Covid-19 treatments, have been centrally procured."" What are the new lockdown rules?

"At least seven people have been killed by a knife-wielding attacker in north-eastern China, media reports say. Another seven people were reported wounded in the mass stabbing, which took place in Kaiyuan, a small city in Liaoning province. Police have arrested a suspect, the state-run Xinhua news agency reports, although a motive remains unclear. Witnesses described seeing a man stabbing people seemingly at random. Violent crime is relatively rare in China, but the country has seen unrelated knife attacks in recent years. They have usually been carried out by people living with mental illness, or seeking revenge against officials or individuals known to them. The suspect in Kaiyuan began attacking people at random just after 08:00 local time, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper reports. Police said an officer was injured while confronting the suspect. No other details on casualties have been provided. An eyewitness told the SCMP that the attack started outside a school and most victims appeared to be middle-aged or elderly women. ""It's lucky that school is off today. Otherwise there could have been more victims,"" said the eyewitness, a woman with the surname Liu.

"This video can not be played Analysis: How West Brom stopped champions Liverpool Semi Ajayi scored a dramatic late equaliser against leaders Liverpool to earn struggling West Brom their first point since Sam Allardyce took charge. Jurgen Klopp's side looked to be going five points clear at the top of the table when Sadio Mane chested down Joel Matip's long ball forward and fired past Sam Johnstone. Liverpool dominated for long periods without adding to their lead but the Baggies improved after the break and equalised in the 83rd minute. Ajayi leapt high above the home defence to send a header in off the post to spark jubilant celebrations from the away team at Anfield. West Brom keeper Johnstone made a superb save to deny Roberto Firmino a winner near the end. Reaction from Anfield and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action Klopp denies Salah is unhappy claims How big is the task facing West Brom boss Allardyce? There was a deep sense of frustration at full-time from Liverpool's players after they dropped league points at Anfield for the first time this season. Klopp, who was booked during the second-half by referee Kevin Friend for protesting a decision, walked to the Kop to acknowledge the 2,000 fans allowed into the ground as the home team headed for the dressing room knowing they had let two points slip. It has been a monumental 2020 with the Reds ending a 30-year wait for a league title, but this was not the result they wanted in their final home game of 2020.West Brom earn point at Liverpool Klopp's side dominated the first half, enjoying 84% possession, but were unable to add to a sumptuous finish by Senegal forward Mane. This video can not be played West Brom deserved the point - Jurgen Klopp Their dominance was highlighted by captain Jordan Henderson, who completed 39 more passes (85) than West Brom as a team (46) before half-time. But the visitors were livelier after the break and, after Liverpool lost defender Joel Matip to injury, the hosts allowed West Brom a way back. Alisson did well to keep out Karlan Grant after the forward had got the better of Rhys Williams before Ajayi's equaliser. Johnstone's save to keep out Firmino at the end only added to Liverpool's frustration, their lead at the top now three points. It looked like it was going to be a long afternoon for West Brom when Mane struck early but the Baggies dug deep to return to the Black Country with a crucial point. This result will give Allardyce, the last opposition manager to win a Premier League game at Anfield, with Crystal Palace in April 2017, huge encouragement as he looks to keep his new team in the Premier League. A week after being beaten 3-0 at home by Aston Villa in his first game in charge, West Brom refused to go under against the leaders and showed the spirit and character needed in a relegation battle. Having drawn 1-1 at Manchester City in Slaven Bilic's final game in charge, the Baggies have now taken points off last season's top two clubs. Allardyce, whose side are still five points from safety, will need help when the transfer market opens next month. But this result against a Liverpool side which had won the previous eight home league games will lift morale ahead of Tuesday's home game with Leeds. This video can not be played 'That wasn't just luck' - Allardyce praises 'superb' West Brom Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""It does feel like a defeat, but we have a point more than before so it is completely fine. ""It's our fault but they deserved the point. In the first half it looked like 90:10 possession - it's a massive challenge to stay on track and do it again but we should have done it."" West Brom boss Sam Allardyce:""We've got a point against Liverpool, which no-one outside of us in the dressing room thought we'd get. ""When the first goal went in I think a lot of people thought how many was it going to be today, particularly after they knocked seven past Palace (last weekend). ""The players were so good today in their discipline, defending as a team, and finding a way in the second half to attack Liverpool when they got the opportunity."" Liverpool have failed to win six of their 15 Premier League games this season, as many as they did in the entire 2019-20 season. Having picked up just one point from their opening six away league games this season, West Brom have since earned two from their last two on the road away to Manchester City and Liverpool. This was the first time Liverpool failed to win a Premier League home game against a side starting the day in the relegation zone - despite taking the lead - since a 2-2 draw with Slaven Bilic's West Ham in December 2016. Among defenders since the start of the 2018-19 season, only Virgil van Dijk and Aaron Pierre (both nine) have scored more headed league goals in England's top four tiers than West Brom's Semi Ajayi (eight). Sadio Mane scored his 69th Premier League goal for Liverpool, moving him level with Luis SuÃ¡rez and behind only Robbie Fowler (128), Steven Gerrard (120), Michael Owen (118) and Mohamed Salah (86) for most goals in the competition for the Reds.

"The Republic of Ireland intends to start Covid-19 vaccinations on Tuesday, a day earlier than planned, the head of the country's health service has said. Paul Reid said teams were working on the registration and consent process. A small number of people at St James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and Cork and Galway university hospitals will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday. The countryreceived its first batch of the vaccineon Saturday. The delivery was part of an EU-wide rollout of the vaccine, with all 27 member states receiving a supply and some countries deciding to administer the jabs immediately. In the Republic of Ireland the first vaccinations were expected to be provided on Wednesday. EU starts mass vaccination in 'moment of unity' This video can not be played The Pfizer vaccine must be stored in ultra-low temperatures But Health Service Executive (HSE) chief executive Mr Reid told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ on Sunday that the ""intention is to start early next week"". He added that there was a ""complex consent process"" in relation to elderly and vulnerable people. Mr Reid said the HSE's initial six-week plan would be to vaccinate all residents and staff of nursing homes and other priority groups from 4 January before moving on to the wider population. ""Our concentration is to do it safely and over a three-week period across nursing homes and then to do it a second time,"" he said. ""Public and private nursing homes will be completed by the end of February."" Mr Reid said about 180 workers were being trained to administer the vaccines in nursing homes, while there would be 1,500 providing it in hospitals. The first Covid-19 vaccinations in the Republic of Ireland will be given this week GPs and pharmacists will be tasked with administering the vaccines at a later date.

"This video can not be played Watch the aftermath of the explosion in Nashville Police investigating a camper van blast that injured three people in Nashville on Christmas Day have named a suspect after DNA was collected at the scene. Officials in the US state of Tennessee said the DNA matched that of Anthony Quinn Warner, 63. Investigators believe that the blast was likely a suicide bombing. On Sunday, the FBI said there was no indication of additional suspects involved and that it was too early to suggest a motive. The blast outside a telecoms office disrupted communications systems in Tennessee and four other states. Officers responded to reports of gunshots just before 06:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on 25 December in an area of the city known for its restaurants and nightlife. Shortly afterwards, they found a camper van broadcasting a warning message to leave the area. Police saidthe van had also broadcast the 1964 hit song Downtown,externalby British singer Petula Clark, the Tennessean newspaper reported. The van exploded a few minutes later, the force of the blast knocking an officer off their feet, police said. The powerful explosion damaged buildings and felled trees The vehicle blew up outside a building belonging to the telecoms giant AT&T, which also occupies an office tower nearby. Buildings suffered structural damage, windows were blown out, and trees were felled. Videos posted on social media showed water from damaged pipes running down walls as alarms howled in the background. Police emergency systems were knocked out across Tennessee. Telephone, internet and fibre optic TV services were also disrupted in Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia, according to AT&T. Police later released this image of the van arriving at the scene early on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mark Drakeford said the four UK nations were ""closer"" under Theresa May than Boris Johnson Wales has had less influence on UK affairs under Boris Johnson's leadership, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Mr Drakeford said the relationship was ""closer"" between the UK government and devolved nations when Theresa May was in No 10. Mr Johnson replaced Mrs May as prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership in July 2019. The UK government has been asked to comment. Speaking in aninterviewwith Beti George for BBC Radio Cymru, recorded before Christmas, Mr Drakeford reflected on a challenging year for Wales amid the coronavirus pandemic and the UK's exit from the European Union. UK 'good deal' is a 'thin deal' for Wales, says FM 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' ""I don't think our voice in Wales has a lot of influence on Mr Johnson,"" he said. ""When Mrs May was prime minister - of course her situation was very different and she didn't have a majority in the House of Commons - and I'm sure that's one of the reasons why she was prepared to listen to others. ""But during the period when she was prime minister, we came together, almost every week, with UK ministers - us, Scotland's first minister and so on. The relationship was closer. ""After Mr Johnson became prime minister, that changed. He has a majority and can do as he likes in the House of Commons, without listening to anyone else."" Wales has deviated from the UK government over its response to the coronavirus pandemic several times over the course of the year, while last OctoberMr Drakeford said there had been no meetings about Brexitfor more than a month. Mark Drakeford said Wales would ""have to rethink"" its relationship with England if Scotland went independent Mr Drakeford said that ""in the long term"" the lack of communication between Mr Johnson and the four nations would not be ""a successful way forward"". ""I think the UK's prime minister has a responsibility to listen and to collaborate and to see what can be agreed by the four governments of the United Kingdom."" ""I don't want to see Scotland disappearing from the United Kingdom. If Scotland decides to take its own path - it's different in Northern Ireland - we'll have to rethink about our relationship with England - and will need to consider the arrangements and the options.""

"Patient demand in London is ""now arguably greater"" than in the first wave of the pandemic, according to the service London Ambulance Service (LAS) received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, the BBC has learned. Nearly 8,000 calls were received, a 40% increase on a typical ""busy"" day. Patient demand was ""now arguably greater"" than during the first wave, an internal message to all staff said. LAS said it was ""working urgently"" to reduce delays. It urged people only to dial 999 with genuine life-threatening emergencies and to use 111 if possible. The rapid spread of the new variant of Covid-19 was said to be the cause of the increased demand, according to the message. The UK reported another30,501 positive tests on Sunday, and 316 deaths of people who had tested positive within the past 28 days. Meanwhile South Central Ambulance Service - which serves Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire - said it was ""extremely busy"" and asked peopleonly to dial 999 in a ""life-threatening or serious emergency"",external. One London paramedic told the BBC that some patients were being treated in ambulance bays upon arrival at hospital, due to a lack of beds inside. ""It's been a horrendous time,"" the paramedic said. ""Ambulance staff are finding the whole situation very stressful."" Figures seen by the BBC show that at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to hospital staff. Levels of patient demand were equal ""and now arguably greater"" than those seen during the first wave of the pandemic, according to the all-staff message sent by LAS chief executive Garrett Emmerson. On 26 December, LAS received 7,918 calls, while on 16 March - one of its busiest ever days - it received marginally more. ""The demand is occurring because of the rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus, initially in north-east London, but now spreading into north central London and predicted to spread further across the rest of the capital in the coming days and weeks"", the memo read. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases The NHS 111 service was twice as busy as usual in London, the message added. London Ambulance Service said it was working to find ways of alleviating pressures. It said private ambulance services, student paramedics, volunteers and the London Fire Brigade had been recruited to supplement its crews in order to provide as many ambulances as possible with two staff members. LAS was also receiving assistance from South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), East of England Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance. Non-patient facing colleagues with clinical skills have also been moved to work frontline shifts. A separate message sent to ambulance crews on 26 December requested them, when it was safe to do so, to transport all patients to hospital on blue flashing lights in order to ""reduce travel times"". Usually only the most seriously unwell patients are taken to hospital in this way. In a statement, LAS said: ""Like NHS organisations across the country, demand for our services has risen sharply over the past weeks. ""Our colleagues in emergency departments are also under pressure receiving our patients as quickly as they can. We are working urgently with NHS partners to reduce any delays. ""The public can support us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies. For urgent medical advice go to: 111.nhs.uk."" Thecapital has the highest coronavirus infection rate of any UK region,with 794.6 cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days. On Sunday, it reported another 9,719 infections.

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"The prime minister has vowed to focus on ""levelling up the country"" and ""spreading opportunity"", after securing the post-Brexit trade deal this week. Boris Johnson told theSunday Telegraph,externalthe deal would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to ""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests to reach the agreement. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Meanwhile, Tesco chairman John Allan told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend he expected the impact on food prices to be ""very modest indeed"". The agreement wasreached on Christmas Eveafter months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December. Scrutiny of the treaty began in earnest on Saturday morning when the 1,246-page document was officiallypublished,external, with Conservative Eurosceptics among those promising to pore over the details. In his first interview since the deal was agreed, Mr Johnson said ""big changes"" were coming, declaring ""it is up to us now to seize the opportunity of Brexit"". He said a ""great government effort"" had gone into the plans, with animal welfare, data and chemicals being areas where the UK could diverge from EU standards. ""This government has a very clear agenda to use this moment to unite and level up and to spread opportunity across the government,"" Mr Johnson added. But he told the Telegraph that the deal ""perhaps does not go as far as we would like"" on financial services. From the end of the transition period on 31 December, financial firms including banks and insurers will not be granted automatic access to EU markets. They will have to be deemed by Brussels to be governed by rules as robust as within the bloc. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 SNP MPs to vote against Brexit trade deal Chancellor Rishi Sunak has sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". ""There is a stable, co-operative framework, mentioned in the deal which I think will give people that reassurance that we will remain in close dialogue with our European partners when it comes to things like equivalence decisions, for example,"" he said. The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses. He said the ""comprehensive nature"" of the free trade agreement ensured ""tariff-free, quota-free, access for British businesses to the European market"", and protected British jobs. The chancellor says he wants to make the City of London ""the most attractive place to list new companies"" But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the agreement did not protect financial services, which employ a million people in the UK. ""This is a thin deal,"" she told the BBC. ""It's not the deal that the government promised and there are large areas of our economy, for example  financial services - that employs one in 14 people in our country - where there aren't clear elements within this deal. ""Much more work will need to be done very speedily by the Conservative government in order to ensure that we keep jobs in the UK as a result of this deal and don't lose even more."" But she said her party would support the deal in next week's vote in order to provide legal certainty for businesses. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also criticised the agreement, saying it was ""threadbare"" and ""bad for jobs, business, security, and our environment"". The agreement will bring ""long delays and higher costs"" because trade with the EU ""will now be wrapped in red tape"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackfordsaid the deal was a ""disaster for Scotland""because it will ""rip us out of the world's largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape"". The SNP's MPs will vote against the deal, he said. In his article, the prime minister said the deal could withstand the ""most ruthless scrutiny"" from the European Research Group of Conservative Brexiteers. The group has assembled a self-styled ""star chamber"" of lawyers led by veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash to examine the full text ahead of a Commons vote. Senior Conservative backbencher Sir Bill said ""sovereignty is the key issue"" as his team analysed the small print of the deal. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? Tesco chairman John Allan told BBC Radio 4's World this Weekend that overall the post-Brexit agreement with the EU was a ""good outcome, certainly far better than having no deal"". ""There'll be a little bit more administration associated with importing as well as exporting,"" he said. ""But, in absolute terms, I think that will hardly be felt in terms of the prices that consumers are paying."" But the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisation (NFFO) accused Mr Johnson of having ""bottled it"" on fishing quotas to secure only ""a fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law"". The National Federation of Fishermen's' Organisation accused Mr Johnson of having ""bottled it"" on fishing quotas Barrie Deas, chief executive of the NFFO, said Mr Johnson had ""sacrificed"" fishing to other priorities, after the subject proved to be an enduring sticking point during negotiations. ""Lacking legal, moral or political negotiating leverage on fish, the EU made the whole trade deal contingent on a UK surrender on fisheries,"" Mr Deas said. What does the deal mean for fishing? Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve Senior UK negotiators have admitted to compromising ""somewhat"" over fish, although they say the EU also made concessions. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accused the government of having ""sold out Scottish fishing all over again"", adding: ""Promises they knew couldn't be delivered, duly broken."" The share of fish in British waters that the UK can catch will rise from about half now to two-thirds by the end of the five-and-a-half-year transition. After this, the UK would be free to reduce EU access to its coastal waters further but could face retaliatory action. Government sources have said any measures taken by the EU would have to be proportionate and would be limited to the fishing industry. Meanwhile, the EU's 27 member states indicated they will within days give their formal backing to the deal, which covers about Â£660bn of trade to allow goods to be sold without tariffs or quotas in the EU market.

"A further 30,501 positive tests for coronavirus were reported on Sunday, as hospitals in parts of the UK warn they are at risk of being overwhelmed. Another 316 people died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 70,752. The true numbers are likely to be higher as some parts of the UK are not reporting data over Christmas. Northern Ireland has not reported cases or deaths and Scotland has not reported deaths. It comes asdoctors in Scotland warned that the health system was ""severely stretched""and a Welsh hospital madean urgent appeal for help with Covid-19 patientson Saturday night. Wales recorded 70 deaths on Sundayof people who had contracted coronavirus. Meanwhile, London Ambulance Service said it had beendealing with more than 400 calls an hour,externalon Sunday afternoon and urged people to only call 999 in an emergency. Withalmost 8,000 calls on Boxing Day, demand for ambulances in London almost matched 16 March, one of the service's busiest ever days. Crews arriving at one London hospital had a typical wait of six hours before they could hand over patients to overstretched hospital staff. One paramedic told the BBC that some patients had been treated in ambulance bays because of a shortage of beds. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"". Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospitals in London and the south of England were under ""real pressure"" due to demand from Covid-19 and other conditions, as well as staff absence. ""The public should be under no illusions that this is one of the most challenging times for the NHS,"" she said.

"The health board said the situation has improved in the last 24 hours An urgent appeal for specialist help caring for coronavirus patients has been made by the health board running Wales' largest hospital. Cardiff and Vale health board, which runs University Hospital of Wales, put out a plea for assistance in its critical care department on Boxing Day. On Sunday, it said staffing has been challenging but the position had improved. Figures show it had no spare intensive care beds on 20 December. A day later, First Minister Mark Drakeford said NHS staff were""stretched to their limit""with Wales' hospitals dealing with more than 2,300 Covid patients.

Proning involves turning patients on to their front to increase the oxygen supply to the lungs.

"At the beginning of 2020, photographer Tash Jones was looking forward to wedding bookings In May, the UK was in lockdown and George Floyd was killed by US police officers, prompting a global outpouring of grief and anger - and an increased sense of urgency around the Black Lives Matter movement. For one black Welsh woman, 2020 changed her life. At the beginning of the year, photographer Tash Jones had a full diary of weddings to capture, and her own marriage to plan. Then the Covid-19 pandemic struck, preventing large weddings - and in May George Floyd was killed after being pinned to the ground by a police officer in Minneapolis. The combination of events led to the mother-of-two from Denbighshire becoming an ""accidental activist"". Born to a white, Welsh-speaking mother and a black Jamaican father, Ms Jones was subjected to sustained racist bullying throughout her childhood, once resulting in her hair being set on fire when she was a teenager, and excrement being left on her doorstep. George Floyd's death and the social media reaction of many of her white friends and acquaintances pushed her into being more vocal about her own experiences and worries for her young children. A mural in Oregon commemorates the death of George Floyd, which shocked the world in May As her wedding jobs were cancelled, she found herself being asked to speak at virtual industry conferences, including one held by Looks Like Film, a large international photography platform. ""I was kind of thrust into speaking really. It wasn't really in my to-do list,"" she said. She was also motivated by ""how I felt about my children, not being represented, and having the same struggles that I had growing up in north Wales"". ""That left me feeling really queasy because I know how hard it was and I don't want that for them. You always want better for your children."" Protesters took the knee outside Cardiff's City Hall as part of the Black Lives Matters movement ""I think because of lockdown, and everybody having their jobs or their hobbies and their social circles taken away, [Black Lives Matter 2020] obviously got more attention because people were forced to watch it and couldn't look away. ""I was getting a lot of messages from clients, from old friends, from acquaintances and people I don't even know, asking me what they can do to be better, or what they can do to be anti-racist. ""And that was a massive pressure for me, and it was detrimental to my mental health because I found myself having to almost handhold everybody I know through a situation that was more harmful to me. ""It was hard to read comments from people that I thought were my friends, showing their true colours. That was so sad because I thought I was a good judge of character. Honestly so many people surprised me."" She started a Facebook group ""Let's Talk with Tash"", where she discussed other issues too, including mental health and plus-size, and also participated in a panel with Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP on mental health among wedding industry professionals during the pandemic. Tash Jones' work won her a place on the Professional Photo magazine's top 50 UK photographers list A high point of the year was to be named as one of Professional Photo magazine's top 50 UK photographers. Partly to set an example to her children, she sent the story to a local paper. Based on the experience of others,including black female MPs, she anticipated there could be a mix-up of her photos. She sent separate emails containing her own photo, and portraits of other black people. But instead of picturing her, they mistakenly put her name against an image of one of her black clients, something she said seemed to happen much more to people of colour. For someone who had fought to be recognised, and endured lifelong racism, the mistake triggered painful memories. ""I was crying my eyes out. It was just a shock... It reaffirmed all those childhood thoughts that I had that I'll never be good enough, that I'll never be [recognised or] important. I can't tell you how massively that impacted me."" She said the mistake also upset other black people - the American client whose photograph was mistakenly labelled, the UK black female photographers network, and her young son, who said ""we don't all look the same"". She said positive representation was so important because, during her childhood, cultural depictions of black people were overwhelmingly negative. ""In films, I would see [black] people who were on drugs or not very good in school and saved by somebody white, or on crack or leaving their kids, or the dads abandon them... I actually thought I didn't have a chance of doing anything."" She said the reporter who made the mistake was ""mortified"", and the paper issued a correction and apologised for any distress caused. But the incident underlined her view that much more needs to be done by organisations to improve diversity and deliver sustainable change. 'My identity crisis over lack of black history lessons' 'Young black people need role models to see' 'More people need to be verbal about inequality' ""Couples in love"" like these photos is the focus of much of her photography work This applies as much to the wedding industry as any sector, she said. As Black Lives Matters protests spread in the summer, big wedding blogs switched from featuring predominantly white people to black brides and grooms. ""All of those images that they all posted simultaneously for weeks and weeks and months and months - that content was available to them prior to George Floyd being murdered. ""Why weren't you posting it then? Why is it taking a worldwide tragic event in uproar for you to be posting diversity? ""That doesn't sit right with me... So people felt the need to perform, when really they should have been addressing why it wasn't like that in the first place.""

"The health board said the situation has improved in the last 24 hours An urgent appeal for specialist help caring for coronavirus patients has been made by the health board running Wales' largest hospital. Cardiff and Vale health board, which runs University Hospital of Wales, put out a plea for assistance in its critical care department on Boxing Day. On Sunday, it said staffing has been challenging but the position had improved. Figures show it had no spare intensive care beds on 20 December. A day later, First Minister Mark Drakeford said NHS staff were""stretched to their limit""with Wales' hospitals dealing with more than 2,300 Covid patients.

"Mark Drakeford said the four UK nations were ""closer"" under Theresa May than Boris Johnson Wales has had less influence on UK affairs under Boris Johnson's leadership, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Mr Drakeford said the relationship was ""closer"" between the UK government and devolved nations when Theresa May was in No 10. Mr Johnson replaced Mrs May as prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership in July 2019. The UK government has been asked to comment. Speaking in aninterviewwith Beti George for BBC Radio Cymru, recorded before Christmas, Mr Drakeford reflected on a challenging year for Wales amid the coronavirus pandemic and the UK's exit from the European Union. UK 'good deal' is a 'thin deal' for Wales, says FM 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' ""I don't think our voice in Wales has a lot of influence on Mr Johnson,"" he said. ""When Mrs May was prime minister - of course her situation was very different and she didn't have a majority in the House of Commons - and I'm sure that's one of the reasons why she was prepared to listen to others. ""But during the period when she was prime minister, we came together, almost every week, with UK ministers - us, Scotland's first minister and so on. The relationship was closer. ""After Mr Johnson became prime minister, that changed. He has a majority and can do as he likes in the House of Commons, without listening to anyone else."" Wales has deviated from the UK government over its response to the coronavirus pandemic several times over the course of the year, while last OctoberMr Drakeford said there had been no meetings about Brexitfor more than a month. Mark Drakeford said Wales would ""have to rethink"" its relationship with England if Scotland went independent Mr Drakeford said that ""in the long term"" the lack of communication between Mr Johnson and the four nations would not be ""a successful way forward"". ""I think the UK's prime minister has a responsibility to listen and to collaborate and to see what can be agreed by the four governments of the United Kingdom."" ""I don't want to see Scotland disappearing from the United Kingdom. If Scotland decides to take its own path - it's different in Northern Ireland - we'll have to rethink about our relationship with England - and will need to consider the arrangements and the options.""

"Since the Boy Scouts started recruiting girls, a number of all-girl Boy Scout Troops have formed in the US A recruitment drive by the Boy Scouts of America is proving ""highly damaging"" to the Girl Scouts, lawyers acting for the latter organisation say. The ""infringement"" meant many parents mistakenly signed their daughters up for Boy Scouts, thinking it was Girl Scouts, lawyers said. In response, the Boy Scouts accused the Girl Scouts of starting a ""ground war"". The Boy Scouts dropped the word ""boy"" from its recruitment programme, and opened up to female members, in 2018. It said at the time that it wasrenaming the Boy Scouts programme Scouts BSAas it prepared to allow girls to join. But the Girl Scouts said the change would erode their brand, calling the move ""uniquely damaging"" to them, filing an initial lawsuit in November 2018 against trademark infringement. Boy Scouts move to accept girls prompts backlash Boy Scouts apologise for Trump's speech This video can not be played What makes this Girl Scout group special? Last month, lawyers acting on behalf of the Boy Scouts asked a judge to throw out the lawsuit, which suggested it could not use ""scouts"" or ""scouting"" in its recruitment material for girls. In the latest filing at the Manhattan federal court on Christmas Eve, the Girl Scouts described the new recruitment programme as ""highly damaging"" to its organisation, having caused an ""explosion of confusion"" among parents. ""As a result of Boy Scouts' infringement... [there have been] rampant instances of confusion and mistaken instances of association between Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,"" the papers stated, adding that the organisation could provide proof of such instances. In a statement released on Saturday, the Boy Scouts said this was ""not only inaccurate - with no legally admissible instance of this offered to date in the case - but it is also dismissive of the decisions of more than 120,000 girls and young women who have joined Cub Scouts or Scouts BSA"". In October 2017, the Boy Scouts' board of directors voted unanimouslyto open the century-old club to all children. The move triggered a fierce backlash online, with the Girl Scouts accusing the group of initiating a ""covert campaign"" to recruit girls into an organisation that had a ""well-documented"" declining membership. The Boy Scouts reportedly has close to 2.3 million members in the US, down by about a third since 2000, compared with about 1.7 million members for the Girl Scouts - excluding adult volunteers.

"Kay White said her secret for a long career was ""liking people and helping one another"" A 93-year-old postmistress - believed to be the country's oldest - is retiring after 80 years of service. Kay White started working at the Post Office in her home village of Claverley, Shropshire, at just 14. In 1960 she became the branch's postmistress, a position she has held ever since. She runs the post office with her 75-year-old niece Ann Madeley and locals say her services will be greatly missed when the branch closes this month. Ms White was appointed postmistress in 1960 and has held the role ever since ""I never thought I would live 'til now,"" Ms White said. ""I thought I shall die and the place will all be sold and I shouldn't have to deal with all this."" The Post Office was closed temporarily earlier this year during the coronavirus lockdown restrictions due to Ms White and her niece's health, giving the villagers a taste of the community without its postmistress. ""Some people come daily just to say hello and speak to Kay,"" Rev Garry Ward said, adding that people ""really felt the loss"". ""The Post Office is the heart of the village and Kay is a big part of that."" Ms White started her career doing the accounts, something she still remembers despite the developments in technology. Ms White started working at the village Post Office as a teenager At the age of 14, she said the then postmistress, Mrs Drew, asked her mother if the teenager would come and help in the office. ""In those days, if your mother says you're going to do something, you do it, and that's how I came to be here,"" Ms White said. In 2010, Ms White was awarded an MBE for her services to the community. Linda Sage, who runs Claverley's hairdressers, said her impact has been ""absolutely immense"". ""She is an absolute character and the person who will miss the Post Office the most is Kay herself,"" she said. ""It's just been her life.""

"More evidence of Margaret Thatcher's disdain for Europe in the final days of her premiership has been revealed in newly released government archives. Notes from 1990 show the former prime minister described plans for a single European currency as a ""rush of blood to the head"". She also called for the European Commission to be turned into a professional civil service. It comes days before the UK startsa new trade relationshipwith the EU. Baroness Thatcher, the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, hit out at the ""politburo"" in Brussels and vowed not to be dictated to, during talks with her Irish counterpart, Charles Haughey. The then-Tory premier likened giving away powers of taxation to gifting sovereignty to Europe, Dublin archives from 1990 show. It was over the issue of Europe, and the divisions it caused in the Conservative Party, that led to her being ousted from Downing Street. Obituary: Margaret Thatcher Thatcher and her tussles with Europe An Irish Government note recorded that Mrs Thatcher said: ""In talking of a single currency, Delors must have had a rush of blood to the head. ""We are not going to have a single currency."" The newly released papers come from a note of talks between Irish Taoiseach Charles Haughey and Margaret Thatcher from 1990 Jacques Delors - who Baroness Thatcher also referred to as a ""mere appointee"" in the notes - was the president of the European Commission and played a key role in the design of the euro and creation of the single market. Baroness Thatcher wanted to turn the commission into a professional civil service, without the power of initiative, whose job would be to service the Council of Ministers - which represents national governments in Europe. ""The days of appointed commissioners must be numbered,"" she said. ""We must give power to the Council of Ministers. ""I am not handing over authority to a non-elected bureaucracy."" Thatcher sent medicines by Barbara Cartland When Margaret Thatcher met Gazza How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols The celebrities 'banned' from Thatcherâs party Thatcher was urged to soften image Baroness Thatcher also said she was getting ""completely fed up of the European community trying to tie us up with bureaucratic regulations"". At the time, Soviet Union control over eastern Europe was collapsing, leading Baroness Thatcher to say: ""We are trying to get eastern Europe to accept democratic standards and here we are recreating our own politburo."" She said while the commission had been necessary ""to start off"" it was a ""totally non-democratic power structure now"". Baroness Thatcher also objected to the idea of a European police force, the papers show.

"Any changes to food prices after Brexit are likely to be ""very modest indeed"" under the deal struck between the UK and the EU, the chairman of Tesco has said. John Allan told the BBC that it would ""hardly be felt in terms of the prices that consumers are paying"". He said the deal was a ""good outcome"" and far better than no deal. But he said the main benefit was that it removes a distraction from business and government. When reports last month suggested that there might not be a post-Brexit trade deal, Mr Allan had warned that food prices could rise between 3% and 5%. But he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the deal agreed this week meant any noticeable changes in food costs for consumers were unlikely. Brexit 'could see people choose cheddar over brie' Could Brexit make your food shop more expensive? Britons told not to stockpile food ahead of January ""The tariffs were the things that were going to generate the price increases,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the deal ensures ""tariff-free"" trade between the UK and EU. Mr Allan said: ""There'll be a little bit more administration associated with importing and exporting. But in absolute terms, I think that will hardly be felt in terms of the prices the consumers are paying."" He said UK companies would be able to cope with the additional work involved in the customs regime, with the possible exception of some small businesses. But 70% of small businesses only trading with the EU, and not further afield, many of them may be dealing with customs paperwork for the first time, Mr Allan warned. If the deal had not been struck, the Tesco chairman had previously suggestedBrexit might change what Britons eat, as the prices of imported food such as brie cheese could have risen by up to 40%. But Mr Allan suggested that Brexit would now only have a ""marginal effect"" on what shoppers put in their trolleys. The deal should also make it easier for businesses to cope with some of thenew customs issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Allan said he was confident the deal ""will not obstruct our ability to keep our NI supermarkets supplied"". ""All the detail is not clear, but we were well set up, even if there was no deal, to continue to supply our NI supermarkets,"" he said. ""I think that will be even easier now."" Any change to ""intra-Ireland"" trade, including agricultural businesses that operate north and south of the border, would be ""marginal"", he said. John Allan was appointed Tesco chairman in March 2015 Mr Allan said he did not see any major advantages to the supermarket industry of any new freedoms as a result leaving the EU, however. ""Certainly Tesco - and I assume our competitors - we're very keen to maintain food standards,"" he said. ""We won't be seeking food from other countries that have different and potentially lower food standards than us, so I don't think it's going to make any material difference."" He suggested the main benefit to the UK government and business would be the removal of Brexit as ""a major distraction"" as the country tries to recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. ""It should enable us to address the challenges and opportunities our economy has got in a much more full-blooded way,"" Mr Allan said.

"The IRA wanted to exclude Sinn FÃ©in from proposed ceasefire talks with the British government, according to newly-released Irish state papers from 1990. The Irish government document said the IRA's so-called army council told two prison chaplains that it was prepared to talk to the UK government. But its least favourite approach was to involve Sinn FÃ©in. It said some Provisional IRA chiefs were averse to the ""socialist views being espoused"" by the party's leaders. The message from a senior Irish official to colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has been made public after being kept in the Republic of Ireland's National Archives - under file reference number 2020/17/34. 260900 DEC 20 - for 30 years. Rev Will Murphy and Fr John Murphy, who were chaplains at the Maze Prison, had been engaged in a two-year process to encourage loyalist and republican prisoners to move away from violence. On 4 May, 1990, Brendan McMahon, head of the Anglo-Irish Division, updated Dermot Gallagher, the assistant secretary at the DFA, on the potential breakthrough with the IRA. ""I had a conversation with Fr Murphy on 2 May who indicated that they had just concluded a series of intensive discussions with the IRA army council,"" he said. ""Arising from those discussions, the two chaplains had a meeting on 1 May with the four church leaders. ""At that meeting, the chaplains reported that the army council had clearly indicated to them their willingness to seek an alternative to the campaign of violence and, with this objective in mind, are prepared to enter exploratory discussions with the British government."" Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke sanctioned backchannel talks between the UK government and the IRA a few months later Mr McMahon added: ""The army council's preference is naturally for such talks to be held in public, though they accept that any talks would probably have to be conducted in absolute secrecy. ""The IRA's third, and least favoured, option would be for talks involving Sinn FÃ©in. ""Fr Murphy commented that one thing which has struck him in the course of this initiative is the noticeable difference between the IRA and Sinn FÃ©in - with army council members referring to Sinn FÃ©in as merely ""the party which is the closest to our view"". Charles Haughey and Margaret Thatcher were two powerful personalities who didn't always see eye to eye The 1990 Irish state papers also reveal that the accession of John Major as UK prime minister was regarded by the Irish government as an ""important opportunity"". Mr Major was seen as less likely to back the cause of unionism as strongly as his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, an internal Irish government communique reported. A note, dated 12 December 1990, written by Dermot Gallagher to then-taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Charles Haughey said: ""The indications are that, as of now, Major has no fixed views or indeed little knowledge about Northern Ireland. ""At the same time, by instinct and temperament, the new prime minister is likely to find the unionist posture essentially anachronistic. ""Unionist rhetoric - which at least at times struck a chord with Margaret Thatcher - will sit uneasily with his pragmatism. ""To the extent that the nationalist case can be couched in terms of logic and common sense, there may be a real possibility of enlisting Major's sympathy and support."" John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in November 1990 On 30 July 1990, Former Eastbourne MP Ian Gow, who was Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, died when the IRA detonated a bomb under his car. The same note also speculates that the UK took the view that the Provisional IRA can ""continue their campaign of violence indefinitely at the present, or even at an increased, level"". ""This has horrendous implications for their security forces and also for the protection of public persons in Britain. ""The Leader of the House, John MacGregor, privately emphasised to the minister on Monday how shaken the Conservative Party had been - and still is - by Ian Gow's murder."" The note said that the chief constable in Northern Ireland had ""emphasised the scale of the security problem"" by saying that 5,000 British troops ""could be swallowed up in any one area of the border"". ""The British, I suspect, also realise that the Provisionals have the capacity, in the absence of draconian security measures, to bring down any new political structures in the north which exclude them,"" it added.

The message from a senior Irish official to colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has been made public after being kept in the Republic of Ireland's National Archives - under file reference number 2020/17/34. 260900 DEC 20 - for 30 years. Rev Will Murphy and Fr John Murphy, who were chaplains at the Maze Prison, had been engaged in a two-year process to encourage loyalist and republican prisoners to move away from violence. On 4 May, 1990, Brendan McMahon, head of the Anglo-Irish Division, updated Dermot Gallagher, the assistant secretary at the DFA, on the potential breakthrough with the IRA. ""I had a conversation with Fr Murphy on 2 May who indicated that they had just concluded a series of intensive discussions with the IRA army council,"" he said. ""Arising from those discussions, the two chaplains had a meeting on 1 May with the four church leaders. ""At that meeting, the chaplains reported that the army council had clearly indicated to them their willingness to seek an alternative to the campaign of violence and, with this objective in mind, are prepared to enter exploratory discussions with the British government."" Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke sanctioned backchannel talks between the UK government and the IRA a few months later Mr McMahon added: ""The army council's preference is naturally for such talks to be held in public, though they accept that any talks would probably have to be conducted in absolute secrecy. ""The IRA's third, and least favoured, option would be for talks involving Sinn FÃ©in. ""Fr Murphy commented that one thing which has struck him in the course of this initiative is the noticeable difference between the IRA and Sinn FÃ©in - with army council members referring to Sinn FÃ©in as merely ""the party which is the closest to our view"". Charles Haughey and Margaret Thatcher were two powerful personalities who didn't always see eye to eye The 1990 Irish state papers also reveal that the accession of John Major as UK prime minister was regarded by the Irish government as an ""important opportunity"". Mr Major was seen as less likely to back the cause of unionism as strongly as his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, an internal Irish government communique reported. A note, dated 12 December 1990, written by Dermot Gallagher to then-taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Charles Haughey said: ""The indications are that, as of now, Major has no fixed views or indeed little knowledge about Northern Ireland. ""At the same time, by instinct and temperament, the new prime minister is likely to find the unionist posture essentially anachronistic. ""Unionist rhetoric - which at least at times struck a chord with Margaret Thatcher - will sit uneasily with his pragmatism. ""To the extent that the nationalist case can be couched in terms of logic and common sense, there may be a real possibility of enlisting Major's sympathy and support."" John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in November 1990 On 30 July 1990, Former Eastbourne MP Ian Gow, who was Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, died when the IRA detonated a bomb under his car. The same note also speculates that the UK took the view that the Provisional IRA can ""continue their campaign of violence indefinitely at the present, or even at an increased, level"". ""This has horrendous implications for their security forces and also for the protection of public persons in Britain. ""The Leader of the House, John MacGregor, privately emphasised to the minister on Monday how shaken the Conservative Party had been - and still is - by Ian Gow's murder."" The note said that the chief constable in Northern Ireland had ""emphasised the scale of the security problem"" by saying that 5,000 British troops ""could be swallowed up in any one area of the border"". ""The British, I suspect, also realise that the Provisionals have the capacity, in the absence of draconian security measures, to bring down any new political structures in the north which exclude them,"" it added.

"Clinicians are warning health services could be overwhelmed by any surge in coronavirus cases after restrictions were temporarily eased at Christmas. The Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties also said the new faster spreading strain of the virus could create a ""perfect storm"". They warned it could take months for vaccinations to alleviate pressure on the ""severely stretched"" system. However Scotland's clinical director denied the system could be overwhelmed. Prof Jason Leitch said measures were already in place to increase capacity where it was needed. But the Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties, which includes anaesthetists, GPs and surgeons, said the short term situation for the NHS remained ""bleak"", despite hope from the vaccine. Mainland Scotland moves into level four lockdown NHS staff in Scotland 'facing perfect storm' When will I be vaccinated against Covid? The warning comes a day after the Scottish government put mainland Scotland into level four restrictions in response to thenew more transmissible strain of coronavirus. Latest Scottish government figures,externalshowed on Sunday that 740 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported across the country. In Dumfries and Galloway health officials said they feared the new strain could be driving a ""rapid increase"" in infections in the area after64 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Wigtownshire. While reports have indicated theOxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be approved within days, the academy said restrictions would still be needed for some time. In a statement they said: ""We know there is hope on the horizon with the rollout of a national immunisation programme, with further vaccines likely to be approved shortly. ""However, it will take months for this to make a significant difference, and the short-term situation facing our NHS and public health services remains bleak."" They said the NHS and social care services across Scotland were now on an emergency footing and while work had been done to reduce infection rates, the new strain of the virus would add pressure in the days and weeks ahead. ""We are gravely concerned that this could lead to the NHS being overwhelmed,"" the organisation said. They called on the public to recognise the severity of the situation and take the necessary steps to support health and social care services. ""Our general practices are exceptionally busy and our hospitals are already near capacity. We risk facing a perfect storm of challenges if we don't take collective action now to prevent further spread of Covid-19."" But Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, denied the system faced being overwhelmed. He told the BBC: ""We're not at risk of overwhelming the health care system. ""But it's not quite as simple as a 'yes no' answer, because we can double, treble, quadruple our care for Covid - the number of beds, the number of intensive care beds - we can absolutely do that. We're ready for it, we have plans for it. ""But you can't do that at no cost to other elements of the health service. ""We don't have a spare thousand doctors and nurses just standing by waiting to do something, so if we have to do more intensive care for Covid, which I really hope we don't, then we will have to take away from somewhere else."" Prof Leitch said efforts had been made to maintain as much of the health service as possible, with hopes that elective surgeries would continue right through the winter. But he added: ""The reality is, depending on what happens over the next couple of weeks, we may have to cut back some of that in order to make room for Covid care."" The Scottish government said it was working closely with health boards to ensure the NHS was prepared for additional pressures. A spokeswoman said: ""Our winter planning process includes assessing our readiness across all aspects of health and care, including Test and Protect, vaccinations, PPE supplies and the maintenance of essential services, including urgent and emergency. ""As part of the specific response to Covid-19, boards will maintain the ability to double their ICU capacity within one week, treble in two weeks and, if required, extend this to over 700 in total across Scotland. In addition, to support this, over 60 ICU and supportive care medicines, as well as supplies of Covid-19 treatments, have been centrally procured."" What are the new lockdown rules?

"This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week Millions of Americans have temporarily lost their unemployment benefits after President Donald Trump failed to sign the Covid relief bill into law. US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to delay signing but the Saturday deadline has now passed. Unemployment benefits and a ban on evictions will be affected. The package worth $900bn (Â£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of difficult negotiations and compromises. Mr Trump says he wants to give people bigger one-off payments. Late on Sunday he tweeted that there was ""good news"" on the bill, but did not give any details. Allow Twitter content?

The bill includes the payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump says he wants Americans to receive $2,000 but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change. In a tweet late on Saturday evening local time, Mr Trump again defended his position on the issue, blaming China for the coronavirus outbreak. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The coronavirus economic relief is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending. A partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday unless legislators pass a stopgap bill before then - but this would not include coronavirus aid and Mr Trump would still have to sign it. About 14 million Americans would be affectedby a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" He praised the example of members of Congress in compromising and reaching a bipartisan agreement, adding: ""President Trump should join them, and make sure millions of Americans can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads in this holiday season."" On Twitter earlier, the president had reiterated his objection to the bill, saying: ""I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill."" The coronavirus aid relief bill - with the larger budget bill rolled in - overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate on Monday but, a day later, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" full of ""wasteful"" items. A woman and her daughter receiving food aid in Florida this month He baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. Mr Trump's decision to bat the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he has largely stayed out of negotiations for a coronavirus aid bill that had stalled since last July. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many have questioned why the president waited until now to object. The fate of the spending package remains in the balance while Mr Trump refuses to sign it. He spent Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida with his family, where he held ""many meetings and calls"", according to his schedule. The White House said it had no update on the prospect of Mr Trump signing the bill by Monday, an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Because it includes money to fund the federal government through to September 2021, a government shutdown looms on Tuesday unless a stopgap bill is passed and signed by the president. But that would not cover the coronavirus aid package, leaving millions of families in peril. The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats, plans to vote on Monday on a standalone bill that would provide the $2,000 cheques to Americans. On the same day, the House is also expected to vote on an unrelated, $740bn defence spending bill, which Mr Trump vetoed on Wednesday instead of signing into law. Lawmakers plan to override the president's veto and enact the legislation anyway, but to do so they need two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate.

"Mark Drakeford said the four UK nations were ""closer"" under Theresa May than Boris Johnson Wales has had less influence on UK affairs under Boris Johnson's leadership, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Mr Drakeford said the relationship was ""closer"" between the UK government and devolved nations when Theresa May was in No 10. Mr Johnson replaced Mrs May as prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership in July 2019. The UK government has been asked to comment. Speaking in aninterviewwith Beti George for BBC Radio Cymru, recorded before Christmas, Mr Drakeford reflected on a challenging year for Wales amid the coronavirus pandemic and the UK's exit from the European Union. UK 'good deal' is a 'thin deal' for Wales, says FM 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' ""I don't think our voice in Wales has a lot of influence on Mr Johnson,"" he said. ""When Mrs May was prime minister - of course her situation was very different and she didn't have a majority in the House of Commons - and I'm sure that's one of the reasons why she was prepared to listen to others. ""But during the period when she was prime minister, we came together, almost every week, with UK ministers - us, Scotland's first minister and so on. The relationship was closer. ""After Mr Johnson became prime minister, that changed. He has a majority and can do as he likes in the House of Commons, without listening to anyone else."" Wales has deviated from the UK government over its response to the coronavirus pandemic several times over the course of the year, while last OctoberMr Drakeford said there had been no meetings about Brexitfor more than a month. Mark Drakeford said Wales would ""have to rethink"" its relationship with England if Scotland went independent Mr Drakeford said that ""in the long term"" the lack of communication between Mr Johnson and the four nations would not be ""a successful way forward"". ""I think the UK's prime minister has a responsibility to listen and to collaborate and to see what can be agreed by the four governments of the United Kingdom."" ""I don't want to see Scotland disappearing from the United Kingdom. If Scotland decides to take its own path - it's different in Northern Ireland - we'll have to rethink about our relationship with England - and will need to consider the arrangements and the options.""

"Rescuers have so far managed to save 14 climbers At least 10 climbers in Iran have died in mountains north of Tehran in an avalanche and blizzards, officials say. The Alborz mountain range that towers over the capital city is popular with climbers and skiers but the past few days have seen treacherous weather. The Red Crescent has deployed 20 teams who have rescued 14 climbers - but at least seven others are missing. The search operation had to be halted at nightfall, and is now expected to resume on Sunday morning.

"Kelly Louise Bellis claims the odours made her daughter's breathing problems worse People living in an area blighted by a ""horrendous"" smell from landfill said matters became unbearable during lockdown. Campaigners took their battle against Wrexham's Hafod Quarry site to the High Court in 2011 but lost. They say the smell from the Johnstown site has ruined their quality of life, and a resident says a fire at the site in May made the smell even worse. Landfill owners Enovert said more work is scheduled for spring 2021. The company apologised to residents, and said work had also been undertaken this year to reduce any further risks from fire and to cut down on unpleasant smells. Kelly Louise Bellis, who lives close to the landfill, said the smell used to make her physically sick, and she believed it had affected her nine-year-old daughter's asthma. She was happy improvements had begun before the pandemic hit, with the smell then becoming less noticeable. Landfill smells have affected the health and quality of life of residents, they say ""The smell was horrendous, but seems to have improved a lot,"" she said in March, just before the country went into lockdown. ""My daughter's asthma has greatly worsened since moving here. ""She did have issues beforehand but they got considerably worse when we moved here, she couldn't sleep because she was constantly coughing. Where does rubbish go after the bin? The Secret Life of Landfill - A Rubbish History Landfill a 'better option' than burning waste ""They added medication after medication until she got to where she is now, and only then did she stop coughing all night. ""I am constantly thinking we have a gas leak because the smell can sometimes be very similar. ""It absolutely stinks the house out, it actually makes you feel physically sick."" Improvements at the site were due to continue until the end of May But Ms Bellis' hopes were dashed when the pandemic hit - with a fire in May making the smell even worse. ""It was horrendous, we were stuck in the house. ""It was bad enough being on lockdown but we had the use of our garden until the fire. But after that we had to stay inside on the hottest time of the year, it was awful."" Placing more soil on a temporarily capped part of the site (completed in January) Installing five new gas abstraction wells (completed in February) Replacing a well to improve liquid removal (completed in February) Installing a ring main to quickly deliver water (completed following the fire) More capping work (some completed, and more to come in 2021) Mark Silvester, chief executive of Enovert, said the company investigated the fire with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and put measures in place so it would be prepared for any more emergencies. He said the landfill gas extraction system was not affected by the fire in June and has continued to operate efficiently. A spokeswoman for NRW added that the number of complaints about the site had reduced since work in June, and it will continue to ensure the site operates in accordance with the environmental permit. Hafod Quarry landfill has affected residents for 18 years, they say But not all residents were encouraged by the prospect of improvements in the first place, with Mark Glaspole saying the ""awful"" smell dies down after complaints but resurfaces. He said: ""I've lived here 18 years and just can't see it getting better, they've had long enough to sort it.""

"Citizens Advice had the highest daily number of visitors to its website was topped four times in one week New figures from Citizens Advice show three quarters of people seeking help with benefits or employment in 2020 had never contacted the charity before. Many people made contact for the first time in their lives after losing jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, the charity said. Its advisors gave one-to-one advice to 1.1m people in 2020, which it said averages to 12 people a minute. It also amassed a record-breaking 47.7m website page views, a 23% rise on 2019. ""We're seeing people who have always been employed, say for 20 years at the same company, and need help navigating the benefits system for the first time after being made redundant,"" said Jamie McGlynn, a contact centre manager. The statistics, shared exclusively with the BBC, showed of 481,834 people seeking advice on benefits, 351,620 (73%) had never asked the charity for help before. Similarly, 146,774 (83%) of 175,852 people needing help with employment issues sought advice for the first time. ""It's really very sad,"" said Mr McGlynn. ""All we can do is keep going and do our best for them. ""We'd usually expect it to quieten down at Christmas, but we're on track to see double the number of people as last December."" The most recent unemployment rate - for August to October - was 4.9%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),which means 1.69 million people were unemployed. Earlier in the year Citizens Advice saw a spike in website visits after government broadcasts As the first lockdowns began across Europe in March, advice pages on claiming refunds for cancelled holidays were most popular, before searches on sick pay surged. When the government advised the population to stay at home, pages offering guidance relating to redundancy and universal credit became the most visited. In June, it reported seeing peoplebecoming ""increasingly concerned"" about redundancy. When restrictions were tightened due to a second wave of infections in November, trends spiked in people searching for answers on self-isolation and rules around meeting other people. Citizens Advice monitored the changes in daily rankings of its most viewed website advice pages during the first lockdown Laiza, a nurse from Middlesbrough, was working for a private hospital on a mental health ward in early 2020, but lost her job when it was forced to close in March and patients were moved home. The 54 year old, who had been working on a zero-hours contact, said by May she had ""no money for food"", with her ""gas and electricity down to almost zero on the meter"". After seeking advice from the charity, Laiza managed to secure an advance payment on her universal credit before finding a job as a permanent nurse. ""The advisers really looked after me, they were always checking on me to see if I was OK,"" she added. Top five most-searched terms on the Citizens Advice website in 2020: Redundancy Universal credit, Divorce Furlough Personal Independence Payment (PIP) Source: Citizens Advice Alistair Cromwell, acting CEO of Citizens Advice, said the data allowed the charity to ""map the trajectory of the pandemic and its effect on people's lives"".

This video can not be played What a pandemic Christmas looked like around the world Franceconfirmed its first case of the new variant - a French citizen in the central town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December, the health ministry said. The man, who had been living in the UK, was asymptomatic and currently self-isolating at home, the ministry said. France closed its border with the UK after the new variant was confirmed in Britain but ended its ban for EU citizens on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. Thousands of lorry drivers spent Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent waiting to cross the English Channel. Cases inDenmark,Germany,Italy, theNetherlandsandAustraliawere reported earlier. The new variant first detected in southern England in September is blamed for sharp rises in levels of positive tests in recent weeks in London, south-east England and the east of England About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says.

Three things are coming together that mean the new variant is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these build a case for a virus that can spread more easily, says the BBC's health and science correspondent, James Gallagher.

"Rescuers have so far managed to save 14 climbers At least 10 climbers in Iran have died in mountains north of Tehran in an avalanche and blizzards, officials say. The Alborz mountain range that towers over the capital city is popular with climbers and skiers but the past few days have seen treacherous weather. The Red Crescent has deployed 20 teams who have rescued 14 climbers - but at least seven others are missing. The search operation had to be halted at nightfall, and is now expected to resume on Sunday morning. Among those who died are a political activist, an academic, a doctor and a mountaineering instructor. At one point on Friday, about 100 people were stranded high up at a ski resort when the cable car broke down. Five things you may not know about Iran Iran country profile There had been earlier warnings of bad weather and possible avalanches.

"George Blake told the BBC he had betrayed more than 500 Western agents to the Soviet Union George Blake, the former MI6 officer and one of the Cold War's most infamous double agents, has died aged 98, Russian media has reported. Over nine years, the Soviet spy handed over information that led to the betrayal of at least 40 MI6 agents in Eastern Europe. He was jailed in London in 1960, but escaped in 1966 and fled to Russia. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said Blake ""had a genuine love for our country"". His death, reported by Russia's state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, was confirmed by Sergei Ivanov, the head of the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Russian president Vladimir Putin described him as an ""outstanding professional of special courage and life endurance"". ""Throughout the years of his hard and strenuous efforts he made a truly invaluable contribution to ensuring the strategic parity and the preservation of peace on the planet,"" he said in a message of condolence. ""Our hearts will always cherish the warm memory of this legendary man."" Obituary: George Blake Blake was born George Behar on 11 November 1922 in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. His father was a Spanish Jew who had fought with the British army during World War One and acquired British citizenship. Blake himself worked for the Dutch resistance during World War Two, before fleeing to British-controlled Gibraltar. He was later, due to his background, asked to join the intelligence service. Blake in 1953 In an interview with the BBC in 1990, Blake said he estimated that he betrayed more than 500 Western agents but he denied suggestions that 42 of them had lost their lives as a result of his actions. His downfall came when a Polish secret service officer, Michael Goleniewski, defected to the West, bringing his mistress and details of a Soviet mole in British intelligence. Blake was recalled to London and arrested. At a subsequent trial he pleaded guilty to five counts of passing information to the Soviet Union. George Blake did enormous damage to British intelligence operations during the Cold War, betraying agents and secret operations and showing that the KGB could run agents within the heart of the British state. His escape from prison added to the embarrassment. The reasons behind Blake's actions sometimes seemed mysterious, particularly his initial recruitment. When I contacted him a decade ago, he told me: ""It is no longer of particular importance to me whether my motivations are generally understood or not."" Part of the problem for him was that he had chosen communism but lived to see its collapse and the end of the Soviet Union, living out his days in Russia, where he was still seen as a hero by the successors to the KGB. In 1995, Blake's escape from HMP Wormwood Scrubs became the focus of the play Cell Mates, starring Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall. And in 2015, the BBC documentary Masterspy of Moscow followed what it called ""the strange life"" of an ""enigmatic traitor"".

"The baked structure overlooks the city of San Francisco A mysterious monolith made out of gingerbread appeared in Corona Heights Park in the US city of San Francisco on Christmas Day. It is unclear who is behind the object, which combines two of 2020's trends - home baking and mysterious structures. Its arrival delighted many in Corona Heights - and yes, the neighbourhood's name predates the pandemic. ""I was pretty shocked when I first saw the gingerbread monolith,"" product manager Josh Ackerman told the BBC. Other monoliths have popped up around the world in recent weeks. What's happened to the mysterious metal monolith? Internet sleuths got there, but the monolith's origins are still a mystery The first, a mysterious metal pillar, was discovered in the desert in the US state of Utah last month - before it disappeared a week later. The sides of the monolith appear to be made out of gingerbread Like its Utah predecessor, the gingerbread monolith is three-sided, with rectangles of gingerbread apparently held together by icing. Its internal structure is unclear. Mr Ackerman,who tweeted photos of his encounter,external, said he had seen a social media post about the structure before he went on a run on Christmas morning, but had not believed the news. ""So when I ran up to Corona Heights and saw it was really there, it was pretty surprising,"" he told the BBC. ""In a way I felt like the gingerbread monolith totally captured the quirkiness of this city and I thought that it perfectly represented many of the reasons why I love San Francisco."" His response was echoed by other residents in the city, with one Twitter user describing the monolith's appearance as ""the perfect act of SF [San Francisco] defiance"". Allow Twitter content?

"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"The chief Brexit negotiators for the UK and EU, Lord Frost and Michel Barnier The UK's new trade deal with the EU marks ""the beginning of a moment of national renewal"", Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator has said. The agreement was announced on Christmas Eve, after months of fraught talks on issues such as fishing rights and business rules. Lord Frost described it as ""one of the biggest and broadest"" ever. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK to exit existing trading rules on 31 December. The European Parliament also needs to ratify it, while EU ambassadorsreceived a Christmas Day briefing on the trade dealfrom EU negotiator Michel Barnier. A 1,246-page document, whichhas been published on the UK government's website,external, sets out the post-Brexit relationship with the EU and includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Lord Frost said: ""There's no more role for the European Court of Justice, there's no direct effects of EU law, there's no alignment of any kind, and we're out of the single market and out of the customs union just as the manifesto said we would. ""All choices are in our hands as a country and it's now up to us to decide how we use them and how we go forward in the future."" Senior members of the UK negotiating team added the deal allowed for a ""managed divergence"" fromEU rules and standards. A free trade agreement usually rules out tariffs being applied to imported goods. Under the terms of this deal if either party acts in a way the other views as anti-competitive, they can go to an independent arbitrator. If that doesn't resolve the complaint, either party can impose tariffs. The French Minister for Europe ClÃ©ment Beaune said: ""There is no country in the world that will be subject to as many export rules to us as the UK."" But the UK negotiators described the rules as ""standard"" for third party trade deals. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said the deal did not provide adequate protections for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and was ""not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal"", he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as ""fair"" and ""balanced"", saying it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". Lord Frost certainly isn't underselling the agreement with Brussels, describing it as representing the ""beginning of a moment of national renewal"". Members of the Conservatives' European Research Group , or ERG - which includes many prominent Brexiteers - have sounded positive about the deal, as outlined by the PM. But some believe that the devil is in the detail. ERG lawyers - including the veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash - are set to dissect the contents of the agreement between now and Parliament's recall on Wednesday. But the former Brexit Secretary David Davis has said one day of scrutiny in Parliament isn't enough - and has accused the EU of having a habit of inserting ""little quirks"" into its treaties. Meanwhile,writing in the Times,external, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK and EU would be able to enjoy a ""special relationship"" as a result of the new deal. He said the deal would give UK businesses ""certainty and the ability to plan for growth and investment"". ""We can develop a new pattern of friendly co-operation with the EU, a special relationship if you will, between sovereign equals,"" he added. But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the government of ""selling out"" Scottish fishing with the deal. Shetweeted,external: ""The Tories have sold out Scottish fishing all over again. ""Promises they knew couldn't be delivered, duly broken."" This video can not be played Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey: ""This look a very bad deal"" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey told BBC Breakfast that the post-Brexit trade deal meant more of the red tape ""we all feared"", ""far more bureaucracy"" and was a ""defeat for those who wanted frictionless trade"". He said the deal was ""bad for business"", ""less safe"" for families and it was therefore ""insupportable"". Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, who voted for Brexit, told the same programme that ""many prime ministers"" had returned from negotiations with Brussels with deals that appear to ""do the right thing and then closer scrutiny demonstrates that they are not as good as first billed"". ""I hope that we have finally seen the pattern broken and I hope that this is a deal that I can support, but it is important that we scrutinise that detail carefully and take some expert advice on it,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Department for Education has announced further details of the Turing scheme which willreplace the Erasmus student exchange from September 2021. It will provide funding for around 35,000 students in universities, colleges and schools in the UK to go on placements and exchanges overseas, stretching beyond Europe with Â£100m set aside for 2021/22, the DfE said.

"Harsher Covid restrictions now apply to millions more people, as rule changes come into force across the UK. Around six million people in east and south-east England have gone into tier four, England's highest Covid level - which includes a ""stay at home"" order. Lockdowns have also started in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and measures have been reimposed in Wales after being eased for Christmas. It comes after official UK coronavirus deathspassed 70,000 on Christmas Day. The toughest measures - which mean the closure of all non-essential shops, as well as hairdressers, swimming pools and gyms - now apply to around 24 million people in England, more than 40% of the population. Meanwhile, work has continued in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries formed after France closed the border to the UK due to the discovery of a fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. The border has reopened but drivers must provide a negative Covid test before making the crossing, with the Department for Transport warning there were""still long queues"" on Saturday evening,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 15,000 tests had now been carried out on lorry drivers, with 36 positive results. Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC she believed all of England was likely to soon be in tier four. ""I think that's where it's heading and it's better to be honest with people so they can plan the next few weeks to understand what might be coming,"" she said, adding: ""To really keep a handle on these numbers, you need to move early."" What are the lockdown and tier four rules from Boxing Day? Find out the rules where you live How many cases are there in your area? The whole of Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, as well Essex, Waverley in Surrey, and all of Hampshire with the exception of the New Forest, are now in tier four. Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire, as well as Cheshire and Warrington, have all moved up to tier three. Meanwhile, Cornwall and Herefordshire have moved from tier one to tier two. Tier four restrictions mean shops in many town and city centres have been closed for the first time in decades on Boxing Day, when there are usually sales. Even some retailers deemed ""essential"" - such as Asda - have opted not to open. In Scotland - which operates under a different tier system - level four lockdown measures have come into force across the mainland for three weeks. Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities are in level three. And in Northern Ireland, a six-week lockdown has begun. The first week, until 2 January, has stricter restrictions, including essential shops closing at 20:00 GMT and no sport.

"China is the only major global economy that will have expanded in 2020 China will overtake the US to become the world's largest economy by 2028, five years earlier than previously forecast, a report says. The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said China's ""skilful"" management of Covid-19 would boost its relative growth compared to the US and Europe in coming years. Meanwhile India is tipped to become the third largest economy by 2030. The CEBR releases its economic league table,externalevery year on 26 December. Although China was the first country hit by Covid-19, it controlled the disease through swift and extremely strict action, meaning it did not need to repeat economically paralysing lockdowns as European countries have done. As a result, unlike other major economies, it has avoided an economic recession in 2020 and is in fact estimated to see growth of 2% this year. 'China is a hard rock. It won't be beaten by virus' Millions of Americans face jobless benefits lapse The US economy, by contrast, has been hit hard by the world's worst coronavirus epidemic in terms of sheer numbers. More than 330,000 people have died in the US and there have been some 18.5 million confirmed cases. The economic damage has been cushioned by monetary policy and a huge fiscal stimulus, but political disagreements over a new stimulus package could leave around 14 million Americans without unemployment benefit payments in the new year. ""For some time, an overarching theme of global economics has been the economic and soft power struggle between the United States and China,"" says the CEBR report. ""The Covid-19 pandemic and corresponding economic fallout have certainly tipped this rivalry in China's favour."" This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The report says that after ""a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021"", the US economy will grow by about 1.9% annually from 2022-24 and then slow to 1.6% in the years after that. By contrast the Chinese economy is tipped to grow by 5.7% annually until 2025, and 4.5% annually from 2026-2030. China's share of the world economy has risen from just 3.6% in 2000 to 17.8% now and the country will become a ""high-income economy"" by 2023, the report says. The Chinese economy is not only benefitting from having controlled Covid-19 early, but also aggressive policymaking targeting industries like advanced manufacturing, said CEBR deputy chairman Douglas McWilliams. ""They seem to be trying to have centralised control at one level, but quite a free market economy in other areas,"" he told the BBC. ""And it's the free market bit that's helping them move forward particularly in areas like tech."" But the average Chinese person will remain far poorer in financial terms than the average American even after China becomes the world's biggest economy, given that China's population is four times bigger. The post-Brexit UK economy will grow by 4% annually from 2021-25 and 1.8% annually from 2026-30 (after shrinking in 2020) India had overtaken the UK as the fifth-biggest economy in 2019 but has slipped behind it again due to the pandemic's impact. It won't take over again until 2024, the CEBR says India's economy will go on to overtake Germany in 2027 and Japan in 2030 Millions of Americans face jobless benefits lapse At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Citizens Advice had the highest daily number of visitors to its website was topped four times in one week New figures from Citizens Advice show three quarters of people seeking help with benefits or employment in 2020 had never contacted the charity before. Many people made contact for the first time in their lives after losing jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, the charity said. Its advisors gave one-to-one advice to 1.1m people in 2020, which it said averages to 12 people a minute. It also amassed a record-breaking 47.7m website page views, a 23% rise on 2019. ""We're seeing people who have always been employed, say for 20 years at the same company, and need help navigating the benefits system for the first time after being made redundant,"" said Jamie McGlynn, a contact centre manager. The statistics, shared exclusively with the BBC, showed of 481,834 people seeking advice on benefits, 351,620 (73%) had never asked the charity for help before. Similarly, 146,774 (83%) of 175,852 people needing help with employment issues sought advice for the first time. ""It's really very sad,"" said Mr McGlynn. ""All we can do is keep going and do our best for them. ""We'd usually expect it to quieten down at Christmas, but we're on track to see double the number of people as last December."" The most recent unemployment rate - for August to October - was 4.9%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),which means 1.69 million people were unemployed. Earlier in the year Citizens Advice saw a spike in website visits after government broadcasts As the first lockdowns began across Europe in March, advice pages on claiming refunds for cancelled holidays were most popular, before searches on sick pay surged. When the government advised the population to stay at home, pages offering guidance relating to redundancy and universal credit became the most visited. In June, it reported seeing peoplebecoming ""increasingly concerned"" about redundancy. When restrictions were tightened due to a second wave of infections in November, trends spiked in people searching for answers on self-isolation and rules around meeting other people. Citizens Advice monitored the changes in daily rankings of its most viewed website advice pages during the first lockdown Laiza, a nurse from Middlesbrough, was working for a private hospital on a mental health ward in early 2020, but lost her job when it was forced to close in March and patients were moved home. The 54 year old, who had been working on a zero-hours contact, said by May she had ""no money for food"", with her ""gas and electricity down to almost zero on the meter"". After seeking advice from the charity, Laiza managed to secure an advance payment on her universal credit before finding a job as a permanent nurse. ""The advisers really looked after me, they were always checking on me to see if I was OK,"" she added. Top five most-searched terms on the Citizens Advice website in 2020: Redundancy Universal credit, Divorce Furlough Personal Independence Payment (PIP) Source: Citizens Advice Alistair Cromwell, acting CEO of Citizens Advice, said the data allowed the charity to ""map the trajectory of the pandemic and its effect on people's lives"". ""But the one constant has been the demand for advice,"" he said. ""Over the past 10 months our frontline advisers have helped more than a million people, each with their own story and struggle.""

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"This video can not be played Watch the aftermath of the explosion in Nashville Businesses and TV personalities have offered more than $300,000 (Â£224,000) to catch those responsible for a camper van blast in the US city of Nashville. The explosion rocked the city early on Christmas Day, injuring three people and knocking out communications systems across the state of Tennessee. Police believe the powerful blast was caused deliberately. Law enforcement agents have searched the home of a possible person of interest in nearby Antioch. No motive has yet been established for the explosion, and no-one has yet said they were behind it. Possible human remains have been found near the blast site. Law enforcement officers searched the property of a possible person of interest in Antioch FBI Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski said officials had received about 500 tips and that they were looking at a ""number of individuals"" in possible connection to the explosion. Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation. Earlier, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said he toured the site, saying on Twitter it was a ""miracle"" that no-one had been killed. He said he had asked President Donald Trump for a federal emergency declaration for his state to aid relief efforts. The FBI is leading the investigation into the explosion Businessman Marcus Lemonis is the latest to donate to a reward pot, pledging $250,000.

"The baked structure overlooks the city of San Francisco A mysterious monolith made out of gingerbread appeared in Corona Heights Park in the US city of San Francisco on Christmas Day. It is unclear who is behind the object, which combines two of 2020's trends - home baking and mysterious structures. Its arrival delighted many in Corona Heights - and yes, the neighbourhood's name predates the pandemic. ""I was pretty shocked when I first saw the gingerbread monolith,"" product manager Josh Ackerman told the BBC. Other monoliths have popped up around the world in recent weeks. What's happened to the mysterious metal monolith? Internet sleuths got there, but the monolith's origins are still a mystery The first, a mysterious metal pillar, was discovered in the desert in the US state of Utah last month - before it disappeared a week later. The sides of the monolith appear to be made out of gingerbread Like its Utah predecessor, the gingerbread monolith is three-sided, with rectangles of gingerbread apparently held together by icing. Its internal structure is unclear. Mr Ackerman,who tweeted photos of his encounter,external, said he had seen a social media post about the structure before he went on a run on Christmas morning, but had not believed the news. ""So when I ran up to Corona Heights and saw it was really there, it was pretty surprising,"" he told the BBC. ""In a way I felt like the gingerbread monolith totally captured the quirkiness of this city and I thought that it perfectly represented many of the reasons why I love San Francisco."" His response was echoed by other residents in the city, with one Twitter user describing the monolith's appearance as ""the perfect act of SF [San Francisco] defiance"". Allow Twitter content?
