"Students with exams this summer should study for seven hours a day over the Easter holidays, an education expert has said. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council,published the advice,externalon the council's website. He said: ""That may seem a lot, but the students who get the best grades will be working this hard."" But teachers and other experts said it was ""unrealistic"" and could put too much pressure on students. Mr Lenon, who retired as headmaster of Harrow School in 2011, offered five tips which included starting at 9am and working for no more than two hours at a time before taking a break. He said: ""The best GCSE and A-level results don't go to the cleverest students - they go to those who revised in the Easter holidays."" His revision schedule would mean 100 hours of work over 14 days in the Easter holiday, with repeat sessions in the summer term and before the exam. Stephen Cumper, a teacher from Belfast, said the advice was ""complete nonsense"". ""Children need to have a work-life balance,"" he said. Colleen Shelley, a teacher in a private girls school in Hertfordshire, said: ""That's absolutely not acceptable. It's not realistic. ""We as adults don't function like that in a work environment. Work should be intermittent - revise in moderation and take breaks."" Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a psychology professor at University College London who researches the adolescent brain, said teenagers were already under a lot of stress. She said on Twitter:,external""This generation of young people are under massive pressure, academically, socially... I'm not sure recommendations like this help much."" One parent, Serian Walker, who is also a police officer, said in her profession she had dealt with suicides by children who could not cope with the pressure. Ms Walker, from Cardiff, said she struggled to get her 15-year-old daughter to take a break from revision. ""I know she isn't sleeping well and I know she's miserable. Of course I'd like her to excel, but not at the cost of her mental health,"" she said. But Clare Wagner, head teacher of the West London Free School, endorsed Mr Lenon's tips as ""excellent revision advice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One recent A-level student also backed Mr Lenon's advice. Natasha, now in her final year at Queen Mary University of London, said that she relied on at least seven hours of study a day in the Easter holidays during her GCSEs and A-levels. ""Looking back, there is no way I would have been able to properly cover all the content you need to revise in fewer than seven hours a day. I can't see how you can get top grades and study fewer hours,"" she said. ""It is not about finding a work-life balance, it is about making a sacrifice.""

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel Palestinian officials say at least 16 people have been killed by Israeli forces and hundreds more wounded during protests at the Gaza-Israeli border. Thousands had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The Israeli military said soldiers had opened fire after rioting. UN Security Council members meeting in New York have called for an investigation into the violence. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. They are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to homes that are now in Israel. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged the UN Security Council to help provide ""protection for our Palestinian people"". ""I... place full responsibility on the Israeli authorities for the loss of the martyrs who were killed today,"" he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area surrounding Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. Israeli soldiers maintained a close watch on the border protests The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting that included petrol bombs and stones being thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. Israel said it had targeted sites of the Hamas militant group. Israel deployed tanks and snipers. Witnesses said a drone had been used in at least one location to drop tear gas. By Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza The death toll from Friday's rally is the largest since the last Israeli war on Gaza in the summer of 2014. Since then Gaza has seen a long period of calm but difficult economic conditions and the Israeli blockade may be the final chapter in the four-year truce between Hamas and Israel. Despite the call for peaceful demonstrations, the confrontations involving angry Palestinian youths were not surprising. Young men have been demonstrating near the border with Israel on numerous occasions, but this time Israel's response was exaggerated. Tomorrow, the Palestinians will bury their dead and head back to the border with Israel to throw stones at the soldiers. The important question that remains is to what extent will peaceful demonstrations succeed in stopping an impending war, or will the protests lead to military escalation? Hamas, the militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, does not recognise Israel's right to exist but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Addressing protesters on Friday, Hamas senior political leader Ismail Haniyeh said ""we will not concede a single inch of the land of Palestine"". He said: ""There is no alternative to Palestine and no solution except to return."" Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people had been wounded by live ammunition. It said one of those killed was a 16-year-old boy. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reiterated that his organisation would not recognise the Israeli state The Israeli military oversees a no-go zone along the Gaza border, citing security concerns, and has doubled its troop presence for the protest. It fears the protest could be an attempt at a mass breach of the border. Palestinians march to mark Land Day east of Gaza City Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israeli foreign ministry said the protest was a ""deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with Israel"" and responsibility for any clashes lay ""solely with Hamas and other participating Palestinian organisations"". UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council the situation in Gaza ""might deteriorate in the coming days"" and called for civilians, particularly children, to not be targeted, Reuters news agency reports. ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law,"" he said. ""Lethal force should only be used as a last resort with any resulting fatalities properly investigated by the authorities."" Palestinians have erected five main camp areas along the Israel border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. An injured protester is evacuated from Jabaliya The Great March of Return protests started on Friday as 30 March marks Land Day, which commemorates the killing of six protesters by Israeli security forces during demonstrations over land confiscation in 1976. The protest is scheduled to end on 15 May, which Palestinians call Nakba (catastrophe) and which marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians have long demanded their right to return but Israel says they should settle in a future Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

"Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour must ""do better"" as a row continues over how the party deals with hostility to Jews. In a Passover message, he said it was easy to denounce anti-Semitism abroad but sometimes harder to see it closer to home. It came as Jewish Labour peer Lord Winston said Mr Corbyn had ""encouraged and endorsed"" anti-Semites. Dozens of Labour politicians are urging him to suspend a senior Momentum figure amid further anti-Semitism claims. In an open letter,the 39 MPs and peers call for Mr Corbyn to suspend Christine Shawcroftfrom the party's governing body after it emerged she hadsent an emailshowing support for a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. After the letter was first published, four more MPs and Lord Mendelsohn added their signatures. In the letter, they say it is ""utterly wrong"" and ""highly offensive to the Jewish community"" that she remained a member of the National Executive Committee. Posting on Facebook, Ms Shawcroft said that she would not be seeking re-election to the NEC and that her term would end this summer. Jeremy Corbyn's message on anti-Semitism came as Jews prepared for Passover, a major festival celebrating their freedom from slavery in Egypt in about 1300 BCE. The term derives from Moses's instruction to the Jews that they should mark their doorposts so that the last of God's plagues against the Egyptians, the death of the firstborn, would pass over them harmlessly. On the first night of Passover, Jewish families traditionally gather for a dinner called a ""seder"", where the story of the exodus from Egypt is retold. Christine Shawcroft resigned as head of the disputes committee but MPs say she should be sacked from Labour's governing body Ms Shawcroft, who is a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, stepped down as head of Labour's disputes panel on Wednesday. Speaking to the BBC, a Labour Party spokeswoman said the letter was not being ignored but that suspending Christine Shawcroft would not be a personal decision for Jeremy Corbyn as there were formal processes for such matters. How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded 'Deeply sorry' Christine Shawcroft quits as Labour disputes chief Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue The council candidate, Alan Bull, is accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he had reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. Ms Shawcroft said she had not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" online post and said she was ""deeply sorry"". In a Facebook post, which was later deleted, she said the row was ""being stirred up to attack Jeremy"". In a second post, she said anti-Semitism was evil and had no place in the party. The lead signatory of the letter, the MP Siobhain McDonagh, told the BBC the group felt ""very strongly"" about the issue and that she and her colleagues had been ""shocked to the core"". In the letter, seen by the BBC on Thursday night, the Labour figures urged Mr Corbyn to take an ""initial step"" in honouring his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism. Meanwhile Lord Winston has told the BBC he is ""deeply ashamed"" of his own party. He said anti-Semitism had become endemic in the party adding, ""our leader who I've no doubt at all is a good person, stands by whilst Labour descends a disastrous path."" Jewish Labour peer Lord Winston says Mr Corbyn 'has a lot to answer for' Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""never be complacent"" about anti-semitism. ""We remember all our Jewish brothers and sisters, who have battled against discrimination and faced the most horrific acts of violence and mass murder,"" he said. He highlighted rising levels of anti-Semitism elsewhere; in Poland, where laws prohibit acknowledgment of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, and in France, where a 85-year-oldHolocaust survivor was murdered. ""We all need to do better. I am committed to ensuring the Labour Party is a welcoming and secure place for Jewish people. In the fight against anti-Semitism, I am your ally and I always will be."" Luciana Berger MP, who has signed the letter, joined a demonstration in London against anti-Semitism in Labour earlier in the week The BBC understands Mr Corbyn intends to announce a speeding-up of the party's disciplinary procedures. He has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, particularly in the past week following fresh accusations of anti-Jewish prejudice afterit emerged he sent an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. The remarksled to a protest outside Parliament,organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council and attended by several Labour MPs, calling on Mr Corbyn to ""root out"" anti-Semitism in the party.

"Parliament voted to cut 46,000 euros off Prince Laurent's annual endowment Prince Laurent of Belgium has had his monthly allowance docked for a year, after a vote by the country's federal parliament. The sanction was imposed after the prince attended a Chinese embassy reception last year without government permission, in full naval uniform. Lawmakers voted for a 15% cut to his â¬307,000 (Â£270,000; $378,000) annual allowance. The move was suggested by Belgium's Prime Minister, Charles Michel. Mr Michel had previously warned the prince to seek foreign ministry permission before conducting any diplomatic activity. Despite that, the royal went to the embassy event and tweeted a photo of himself there. Belgian prince protests over fine Burger King ad angers real Belgian royals Belgium country profile Prince Laurent, who is the younger brother of King Philippe, wrote a lengthy emotional letter to parliament before the vote on his endowment, arguing that, as a royal, he is unable to work for a living. He described the vote as ""the trial of my life"" and said it would ""likely cause me serious prejudice"" if MPs went against him. ""This allowance, the reduction of which is being discussed as a result of political or media currents, is the price of a life - the price of my life, which is largely behind me now,"" he wrote. The 54-year-old prince is the younger brother of Belgium's King Philippe The prince, 54, said the royal family had obstructed his attempts to be financially independent. ""I even had to get permission to marry, and even today I pay the price for choosing a woman I love, without title or fortune,"" he wrote in the three-page self-defence. Lawmakers ultimately rejected his claim that no citizen of their country had been so exploited, voting to cut his stipend by 93 to 23 votes. The move is effectively a â¬46,000 fine. However, some MPs argued that since princes are not obliged to seek an endowment, it should instead be viewed as a deduction from a donation. Prince Laurent is no stranger to controversy and is sometimes termed theprince maudit- the ""cursed prince"" - in Belgium. He has racked up several speeding fines, and his unofficial appearance at the Chinese event - held for the 90th anniversary of the Chinese army - was not the first of its kind. He had previously been criticised for attending meetings in Libya when the late Muammar Gaddafi was still in power, and making an unsanctioned 2011 trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, a former Belgian colony. Despite this, he is also seen as a likeable figure, if something of an oddball, AFP news agency notes.

"Heartbeat actor Bill Maynard has died at the age of 89 after a career spanning eight decades. Daughter-in-law Jacqueline Reddin said he died in hospital in Leicestershire, shortly after breaking his hip in a fall from a mobility scooter. ""He was larger than life and he just loved showbiz,"" she said. ""He was so proud of the fact that he had been working for 81 years."" He was perhaps best known as Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in Heartbeat. From variety halls to TV success Maynard - whose real name was Walter Williams - starred as the scruffy, eccentric poacher in the police drama for eight years, from 1992 to 2000, and was in its spin-off The Royal until 2003. Other roles included Oh No, It's Selwyn Froggitt!, The Gaffer and In Sickness and In Health. He also made appearances in Carry On films Carry On At Your Convenience, Carry On Matron and Carry On Dick, and was Sergeant Beetroot in TV series Worzel Gummidge in 1980. Maynard's most recent role was a brief appearance in 2017 drama The Moorside, about the disappearance of Shannon Matthews. Maynard, back right, appeared in In Sickness and In Health Outside of acting, Maynard tried his hand at singing - coming second in the British heat of the 1957 Eurovision Song Contest - and politics, standing as an independent against Tony Benn in the 1984 Chesterfield by-election. From 2003 to 2008 he had a BBC Radio Leicester show and he celebrated 60 years since his first TV appearance in 2013 by releasing a version of What a Wonderful World. Speaking at the time, he said that ""making people laugh and smile brings me a lot of personal satisfaction"". ""I am delighted to be still in the entertainment industry doing what I love most - 76 years since I began my career,"" he had said. ""I have had an amazing career and I consider myself to be very lucky to still have the energy and enthusiasm to take on new work."" Maynard's daughter-in-law said he had recently filmed an episode of BBC One quiz show Pointless, which was yet to air. He leaves a daughter and a son, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Bill Maynard in 1970, preparing for a role as Charles Dickens Tributes have been paid to Maynard, with actor Ian Champion saying he ""had the blessing"" to work with the ""colourful, warm and mischievous"" actor on Heartbeat.

"Mamba, the former legal high, mimics the effects of cannabis, but is said to be more potent A warning has been issued after the deaths of seven men which may be linked to former legal high Black Mamba. Drug workers in the West Midlands were sent an alert after ""a cluster"" of incidents in a short period last week. Public Health England (PHE) sent out an alert about the deaths, which happened across Birmingham and the Black Country. Police confirmed one death, at a city centre hostel, was linked to the drug, also known as spice or mamba. A second death, also at the hostel, is believed to be drug-related. The drug mimics the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis. PHE said ""an alert was sent out to commissioners of services and outreach drug workers,"" following the deaths. A man in his 30sdied in the city centre last Aprilafter taking a lethal dose of the drug. Trident Group, who run the hostel in the city centre, where two men died, said it was working with local authorities. ""Our condolences go out to the families at this time. ""We are currently working with the local authorities, the police, and others, responding to ongoing investigations and difficulties that are being experienced in the city."" There is also an unconfirmed report of a prisoner dying at HMP Birmingham in Winson Green.

"Police say the cannabis haul is one of the biggest they have found ""for some time"" Two men have been charged after the seizure of what police believe could be one of Northern Ireland's biggest ever hauls of herbal cannabis. The drugs were found hidden inside an industrial-sized fuel tank at a property in Dromore in County Down. The haul is estimated to be worth about Â£1.3m. It was discovered as part of a joint investigation involving the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and customs officials. A disc cutter was used to open the fuel tank in which the drugs were hidden Police also carried out a number of follow-up searches at other locations. The drugs are believed to have entered Ireland at Dublin Port. The men, aged 32 and 37, have been charged with fraudulently importing class B drugs, possession of drugs and possession of drugs with intent to supply. They are due to appear at Newry Magistrates' Court on Monday. Det Supt Bobby Singleton said the drugs had been concealed in a sophisticated fashion Det Supt Bobby Singleton of the PSNI described the find as the largest seizure of drugs ""for some time"". He said that the Irish authorities shared information about the drugs with the PSNI. ""We were then able to mount a policing operation here in the north and make a successful intervention to seize what we estimate to be somewhere in the region of Â£1.3m of drugs,"" he said. Det Supt Singleton said the drugs would have been broken up and sold all over Ireland if it had not been found. ""We had seen a shift in terms of the trend around importation, from large load to smaller and more frequent attempt to bring drugs in,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

""That's absolutely vital in order to help us tackle organised crime on the island of Ireland."" Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said the find had ""undoubtedly prevented the significant harm that would have resulted from this huge consignment of drugs reaching the streets"" across Ireland. A 78-year-old man and three women - one aged 42 and two aged 68 - were also arrested as part of the police operation and were later released on bail.

"Blane McIlroy, Stuart Olding, Paddy Jackson and Rory Harrison were all cleared of all charges Comments posted online by a juror in the rugby rape trial have been referred to Northern Ireland's attorney general. The remarks,first reported in The Irish Times,,externalwere made in an internet forum after the verdict on Wednesday. All four accused were cleared of all the charges they faced after a nine-week trial. The juror reportedly made the remarks in the comments section of an article about the acquittals in the trial. Rugby rape trial: What lessons can be learned? DUP MP says rape accused should have anonymity Trial that played out beyond court A spokesman for Attorney General John Larkin's office confirmed that the matter had been referred to the Northern Ireland's senior law officer by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan. Mr Larkin is to investigate whether the comments represent a breach of contempt of court laws. Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were cleared of all chargeson Wednesday. The first comment appeared about eight hours after the jury delivered unanimous ""not guilty"" verdicts. The juror made a series of comments describing the trial, as well as answering questions from other users. The posts set out the reasons the jury came to its decision and defended the amount of time it took to reach a verdict. Irish Times journalist Conor Gallagher said the comments were posted under a story about the verdict and purported to be from a juror in the case. ""They seemed to be fairly accurate, they seemed to know a lot about the case; at first read, they seemed to be authentic,"" he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""So we got in touch with the Public Prosecution Service and asked them about it and they got back to us and said they'd referred the matter on to the office of the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland. ""The Lord Chief Justice's office then told us they'd referred the matter on  to the attorney general's office and to other relevant authorities."" Mr Gallagher said the attorney general's office got in touch with the juror and told them to take the comments down, which was then done. He said the juror contacted the Irish Times on Thursday night and defended the comments. ""They [said they] didn't comment on anything related to the jury deliberations [and] therefore were not in breach of the [judge's] order,"" he said. ""They were very worried, they said they were in trouble, the Lord Chief Justice's representative asked them if they have a solicitor."" The juror told the Irish Times that when Judge Patricia Smyth discharged the jury, she told them to go about their daily life but not to reveal discussions that took place within the jury room. When asked about the juror's comments, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: ""We are aware of comments made on a social media platform."" Meanwhile, the legal firm representing Mr Jackson is suing Irish senator AodhÃ¡n Ã³ RÃ­ordÃ¡in over a social media post related to the trial. ""We have issued pre-action libel correspondence against a named Senator in the Republic of Ireland,"" said Marie Hans, a senior associate with KRW LAW solicitors. ""The legal action relates to a tweet sent to a number of other persons before it was eventually taken down."" The Gov.uk website issues advice,externalto people called up to serve on a jury during a trial. ""Don't discuss the trial with anyone until it's finished, except with other jury members in the deliberation room,"" it says. ""After the trial you mustn't talk about what happened in the deliberation room, even with family members. You can talk about what happened in the courtroom. ""Don't post comments about the trial on social media websites like Facebook or Twitter - even after the trial's finished. ""This is contempt of court and you can be fined or sent to prison."" It also emerged on Friday thattwo people have been questioned by police after allegedly revealing the identity of the complainant,externalin the rape trial. Complainants in rape trials in Ireland and the UK are entitled to anonymity, and it is an offence to publish their identity. A PSNI spokesman said two people had been interviewed in relation to an offence under Section 5 of the UK's Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1992. The spokesman said the investigation was ongoing and two files had been forwarded to the Public Prosecutions Service for consideration.

"Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour must ""do better"" as a row continues over how the party deals with hostility to Jews. In a Passover message, he said it was easy to denounce anti-Semitism abroad but sometimes harder to see it closer to home. It came as Jewish Labour peer Lord Winston said Mr Corbyn had ""encouraged and endorsed"" anti-Semites. Dozens of Labour politicians are urging him to suspend a senior Momentum figure amid further anti-Semitism claims. In an open letter,the 39 MPs and peers call for Mr Corbyn to suspend Christine Shawcroftfrom the party's governing body after it emerged she hadsent an emailshowing support for a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. After the letter was first published, four more MPs and Lord Mendelsohn added their signatures. In the letter, they say it is ""utterly wrong"" and ""highly offensive to the Jewish community"" that she remained a member of the National Executive Committee. Posting on Facebook, Ms Shawcroft said that she would not be seeking re-election to the NEC and that her term would end this summer. Jeremy Corbyn's message on anti-Semitism came as Jews prepared for Passover, a major festival celebrating their freedom from slavery in Egypt in about 1300 BCE. The term derives from Moses's instruction to the Jews that they should mark their doorposts so that the last of God's plagues against the Egyptians, the death of the firstborn, would pass over them harmlessly. On the first night of Passover, Jewish families traditionally gather for a dinner called a ""seder"", where the story of the exodus from Egypt is retold. Christine Shawcroft resigned as head of the disputes committee but MPs say she should be sacked from Labour's governing body Ms Shawcroft, who is a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, stepped down as head of Labour's disputes panel on Wednesday. Speaking to the BBC, a Labour Party spokeswoman said the letter was not being ignored but that suspending Christine Shawcroft would not be a personal decision for Jeremy Corbyn as there were formal processes for such matters. How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded 'Deeply sorry' Christine Shawcroft quits as Labour disputes chief Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue The council candidate, Alan Bull, is accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he had reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. Ms Shawcroft said she had not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" online post and said she was ""deeply sorry"". In a Facebook post, which was later deleted, she said the row was ""being stirred up to attack Jeremy"". In a second post, she said anti-Semitism was evil and had no place in the party. The lead signatory of the letter, the MP Siobhain McDonagh, told the BBC the group felt ""very strongly"" about the issue and that she and her colleagues had been ""shocked to the core"". In the letter, seen by the BBC on Thursday night, the Labour figures urged Mr Corbyn to take an ""initial step"" in honouring his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism. Meanwhile Lord Winston has told the BBC he is ""deeply ashamed"" of his own party. He said anti-Semitism had become endemic in the party adding, ""our leader who I've no doubt at all is a good person, stands by whilst Labour descends a disastrous path."" Jewish Labour peer Lord Winston says Mr Corbyn 'has a lot to answer for' Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""never be complacent"" about anti-semitism. ""We remember all our Jewish brothers and sisters, who have battled against discrimination and faced the most horrific acts of violence and mass murder,"" he said. He highlighted rising levels of anti-Semitism elsewhere; in Poland, where laws prohibit acknowledgment of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, and in France, where a 85-year-oldHolocaust survivor was murdered. ""We all need to do better. I am committed to ensuring the Labour Party is a welcoming and secure place for Jewish people. In the fight against anti-Semitism, I am your ally and I always will be."" Luciana Berger MP, who has signed the letter, joined a demonstration in London against anti-Semitism in Labour earlier in the week The BBC understands Mr Corbyn intends to announce a speeding-up of the party's disciplinary procedures. He has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, particularly in the past week following fresh accusations of anti-Jewish prejudice afterit emerged he sent an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. The remarksled to a protest outside Parliament,organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council and attended by several Labour MPs, calling on Mr Corbyn to ""root out"" anti-Semitism in the party.

"Stars including Coleen Nolan and breast cancer survivor Victoria Derbyshire have been hailed ""warrior women"" for baring all for breast cancer awareness. Eight women took part in The Real Full Monty: Ladies' Night, stripping off in front of a live audience. Those chosen have all been affected by cancer. They were seen on the ITV show dancing to This Is Me from The Greatest Showman in a routine choreographed by Diversity's Ashley Banjo. The group included cancer survivor Ruth Madoc, the actress, and singer and presenter Michelle Heaton, who had a double mastectomy after learning she has the BRCA2 gene. Actress Helen Lederer also took part, along with DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford, Emmerdale's Sally Dexter and Towie's Megan McKenna. They were assembled by Loose Women's Nolan, whose sister Bernie died of breast cancer in 2013. Another sister, Linda, is now battling the condition. ""I'm here and one of my sisters isn't - and one of them is going through hell again,"" she said. ""I'm doing it for them."" Derbyshire became emotional during the show Derbyshire was initially uncertain about taking part, breaking down on the first day of rehearsals saying: ""This is so out of my comfort zone. God, this is day one, what the heck. ""I haven't cried for ages about having cancer, or my body or whatever."" It was also an emotional experience for Heaton, who talked about her reconstructed breasts, saying she felt ""disconnected"" from them. They also took part in a Calendar Girls-inspired photoshoot, with food items covering their bare breasts, to increase their confidence. The women took part in a Calendar Girls photoshoot during the documentary On the big night, the women took to the stage in Sheffield in bronze sequinned wrap dresses - halfway through, they pulled off the dresses to show tasselled black lingerie, which they accessorised with red feather fans. Turning away from the crowds, they removed their bras and covered themselves with the feathers, before then facing the audience - and removing the feathers. The final shot was filmed from behind. It proved emotional for all of the women, with Derbyshire and Nolan sharing a hug as the performance drew to a close. Derbyshire said the programme, which followed a male version of the show featuring the likes of James Argent and John Partridge, had made her ""really happy"". ""There might be someone watching who learns something about breast cancer that they didn't know before and it might save their life and that is massive,"" she added. Heaton said she felt ""overwhelmed"" after the experience,adding on Twitter,external: ""#TheRealFullMontyladies has been the best thing I've ever done to help overcome my fears and raise #BreastCancerAwareness."" There was praise and admiration from the audience after the show aired on ITV1 on Thursday night. Viewer Vikki Longman said it made her feel ""empowered"". Allow Twitter content?

"Andrew Bosworth says his memo was intended to be provocative A Facebook executive's memo that claimed the ""ugly truth"" was that anything it did to grow was justified has been made public, embarrassing the company. The 2016 post said that this applied even if it meant people might die as a result of bullying or terrorism. Both the author and the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have denied they actually believe the sentiment. But it risks overshadowing the firm's efforts to tackle an earlier scandal. Facebook has been under intense scrutiny since it acknowledged that it had received reports thata political consultancy- Cambridge Analytica - had not destroyed data harvested from about 50 million of its users years earlier. The memo was first made public by the Buzzfeed news site, and was written by Andrew Bosworth. So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack co-ordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned. [...] That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it. Read the post in full,external Mr Bosworth - who co-invented Facebook's News Feed - has held high-level posts at the social network since 2006, and is currently in charge of its virtual reality efforts. Mr Bosworth has since tweeted,externalthat he ""didn't agree"" with the post at the time he had posted it, buthe had shared it with staff,externalto be ""provocative."" ""Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas,"" he added. Facebook privacy settings revamped after scandal Cambridge Analytica files spell out election tactics Data row: Facebook's Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Facebook's chief says that Facebook does not believe connecting people is ""enough by itself"" Mark Zuckerberg has issued his own statement. ""Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things,"" it said. ""This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means."" A follow-upreport by the Verge,externalrevealed that dozens of Facebook's employees have subsequently used its internal chat tools to discuss concerns that such material had been leaked to the media. What immediately struck me about this leaked memo was the line about ""all the questionable contact importing practices"". When Idownloaded my Facebook data recently, it was the presence of thousands of my phone contacts that startled me. But the company's attitude seemed to be that this was normal and it was up to users to switch off the function if they didn't like it. What we now know is that in 2016 a very senior executive thought this kind of data gathering was questionable. So, why is it only now that the company is having a debate about this and other dubious practices? Until now, Facebook has not been leaky. Perhaps we will soon get more insights from insiders as this adolescent business tries to grow up and come to terms with its true nature. The disclosure coincided with Facebook's latest efforts to address the public and investors' concerns with its management. Its shares are trading about 14% lower than they were before the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, and several high profile figures have advocated deleting Facebook accounts. The company hosted apress conference on Thursday,external, at which it said it had: begun fact-checking photos and videos posted in France, and would expand this to other countries soon developed a new fake account investigative tool to prevent harmful election-related activities started work on a public archive that will make it possible for journalists and others to investigate political-labelled ads posted to its platform In previous days it had also announced arevamp of its privacy settings, and said it would restrict the amount of data exchanged with businesses that collect information on behalf of advertisers. The latest controversy is likely, however, to provide added ammunition for critics. CNN reported earlier this week that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to testify before Congress,external""within a matter of weeks"" afterrefusing a request to do sobefore UK MPs. However, the BBC has been unable to independently verify whether he answer questions in Washington.

"Blane McIlroy, Stuart Olding, Paddy Jackson and Rory Harrison were all cleared of all charges Comments posted online by a juror in the rugby rape trial have been referred to Northern Ireland's attorney general. The remarks,first reported in The Irish Times,,externalwere made in an internet forum after the verdict on Wednesday. All four accused were cleared of all the charges they faced after a nine-week trial. The juror reportedly made the remarks in the comments section of an article about the acquittals in the trial. Rugby rape trial: What lessons can be learned? DUP MP says rape accused should have anonymity Trial that played out beyond court A spokesman for Attorney General John Larkin's office confirmed that the matter had been referred to the Northern Ireland's senior law officer by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan. Mr Larkin is to investigate whether the comments represent a breach of contempt of court laws. Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were cleared of all chargeson Wednesday. The first comment appeared about eight hours after the jury delivered unanimous ""not guilty"" verdicts. The juror made a series of comments describing the trial, as well as answering questions from other users. The posts set out the reasons the jury came to its decision and defended the amount of time it took to reach a verdict. Irish Times journalist Conor Gallagher said the comments were posted under a story about the verdict and purported to be from a juror in the case. ""They seemed to be fairly accurate, they seemed to know a lot about the case; at first read, they seemed to be authentic,"" he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""So we got in touch with the Public Prosecution Service and asked them about it and they got back to us and said they'd referred the matter on to the office of the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland. ""The Lord Chief Justice's office then told us they'd referred the matter on  to the attorney general's office and to other relevant authorities."" Mr Gallagher said the attorney general's office got in touch with the juror and told them to take the comments down, which was then done. He said the juror contacted the Irish Times on Thursday night and defended the comments. ""They [said they] didn't comment on anything related to the jury deliberations [and] therefore were not in breach of the [judge's] order,"" he said. ""They were very worried, they said they were in trouble, the Lord Chief Justice's representative asked them if they have a solicitor."" The juror told the Irish Times that when Judge Patricia Smyth discharged the jury, she told them to go about their daily life but not to reveal discussions that took place within the jury room. When asked about the juror's comments, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: ""We are aware of comments made on a social media platform."" Meanwhile, the legal firm representing Mr Jackson is suing Irish senator AodhÃ¡n Ã³ RÃ­ordÃ¡in over a social media post related to the trial. ""We have issued pre-action libel correspondence against a named Senator in the Republic of Ireland,"" said Marie Hans, a senior associate with KRW LAW solicitors. ""The legal action relates to a tweet sent to a number of other persons before it was eventually taken down."" The Gov.uk website issues advice,externalto people called up to serve on a jury during a trial. ""Don't discuss the trial with anyone until it's finished, except with other jury members in the deliberation room,"" it says. ""After the trial you mustn't talk about what happened in the deliberation room, even with family members. You can talk about what happened in the courtroom. ""Don't post comments about the trial on social media websites like Facebook or Twitter - even after the trial's finished. ""This is contempt of court and you can be fined or sent to prison."" It also emerged on Friday thattwo people have been questioned by police after allegedly revealing the identity of the complainant,externalin the rape trial. Complainants in rape trials in Ireland and the UK are entitled to anonymity, and it is an offence to publish their identity. A PSNI spokesman said two people had been interviewed in relation to an offence under Section 5 of the UK's Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1992. The spokesman said the investigation was ongoing and two files had been forwarded to the Public Prosecutions Service for consideration.

"Acrylamide is produced when coffee beans are roasted Coffee sold in California must carry a cancer warning, a court has ruled. The judge in Los Angeles said Starbucks and about 90 other coffee sellers had failed to warn customers about a potentially toxic compound that is produced during the roasting process. The firms were sued by a California-based non profit-group over the chemical acrylamide. The group argued that as acrylamide is regarded as carcinogenic under state law, it should be sold with a warning. Ruling in favour of the Council for Education and Research on Toxics, Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said the companies should not be exempt from the law, as they had failed to prove that the ""consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health"". The companies have until 10 April to appeal the decision. Acrylamide is created when starchy foods are roasted, grilled or fried for long periods at high temperatures. Studies in animals found that the chemical causes tumours. This suggests that it also has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Scientists believe that there should be a margin of exposure of 10,000 or higher between an average adult's intake of acrylamide and the lowest dose which could cause adverse effects. But at the moment the numbers are 425 for the average adult and 50 for the highest consuming toddlers, making it a slight public health concern, UK and European food safety experts say. A statement from the National Coffee Association (NCA) said the industry was considering an appeal. ""Cancer warning labels on coffee would be misleading. The US government's own Dietary Guidelines state that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle,"" the statement said. Coffee drinkers live longer - perhaps Q&A: Acrylamide The lawsuit was filed in 2010 and says coffee sellers should pay fines of up to $2,500 (Â£1,800) for every person exposed to acrylamide in California since 2002. The next phase of the trial will determine the exact penalties, but some companies have reportedly agreed to settle and post warnings about the chemical. The ruling came despite a recent easing of concern about the potential health impact of coffee, which was removed from a list of possible carcinogens by the UN's World Heath Organization in 2016. Last year, a study of almost half a million people from 10 European countries found that drinking three cups of coffee a day may have health benefits. But sceptical experts said it was impossible to say for sure that the coffee was having a protective effect. Q&A: Acrylamide - should we give up toast?

"Stars including Coleen Nolan and breast cancer survivor Victoria Derbyshire have been hailed ""warrior women"" for baring all for breast cancer awareness. Eight women took part in The Real Full Monty: Ladies' Night, stripping off in front of a live audience. Those chosen have all been affected by cancer. They were seen on the ITV show dancing to This Is Me from The Greatest Showman in a routine choreographed by Diversity's Ashley Banjo. The group included cancer survivor Ruth Madoc, the actress, and singer and presenter Michelle Heaton, who had a double mastectomy after learning she has the BRCA2 gene. Actress Helen Lederer also took part, along with DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford, Emmerdale's Sally Dexter and Towie's Megan McKenna. They were assembled by Loose Women's Nolan, whose sister Bernie died of breast cancer in 2013. Another sister, Linda, is now battling the condition. ""I'm here and one of my sisters isn't - and one of them is going through hell again,"" she said. ""I'm doing it for them."" Derbyshire became emotional during the show Derbyshire was initially uncertain about taking part, breaking down on the first day of rehearsals saying: ""This is so out of my comfort zone. God, this is day one, what the heck. ""I haven't cried for ages about having cancer, or my body or whatever."" It was also an emotional experience for Heaton, who talked about her reconstructed breasts, saying she felt ""disconnected"" from them. They also took part in a Calendar Girls-inspired photoshoot, with food items covering their bare breasts, to increase their confidence. The women took part in a Calendar Girls photoshoot during the documentary On the big night, the women took to the stage in Sheffield in bronze sequinned wrap dresses - halfway through, they pulled off the dresses to show tasselled black lingerie, which they accessorised with red feather fans. Turning away from the crowds, they removed their bras and covered themselves with the feathers, before then facing the audience - and removing the feathers. The final shot was filmed from behind. It proved emotional for all of the women, with Derbyshire and Nolan sharing a hug as the performance drew to a close. Derbyshire said the programme, which followed a male version of the show featuring the likes of James Argent and John Partridge, had made her ""really happy"". ""There might be someone watching who learns something about breast cancer that they didn't know before and it might save their life and that is massive,"" she added. Heaton said she felt ""overwhelmed"" after the experience,adding on Twitter,external: ""#TheRealFullMontyladies has been the best thing I've ever done to help overcome my fears and raise #BreastCancerAwareness."" There was praise and admiration from the audience after the show aired on ITV1 on Thursday night. Viewer Vikki Longman said it made her feel ""empowered"". Allow Twitter content?

"The average price for unleaded petrol is much higher on motorways, industry figures suggest The transport secretary has called for an investigation into ""exploitative"" motorway fuel prices. Chris Grayling told the competitions watchdog prices could be up to 19p more per litre than on forecourts elsewhere. He said the UK's three biggest operators - Moto, Welcome Break and RoadChef - should be investigated to ensure drivers got a ""fairer deal"". Roadchef said it did not set fuel prices.Moto said prices reflected the cost of building and running services,external. In a statement, it said many of its forecourts were owned by fuel companies who set the prices to ""reflect the complexities of motorway trading, such as round the clock opening.""

Swan in lane causes motorway delays Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? England's best and worst motorway service stations Writing to Andrea Coscelli, head of the Competition and Markets Authority (formerly the Office of Fair Trading), Mr Grayling says: ""I am concerned that prices which are higher than other forecourts may exploit users in a situation where there is less choice and competition and discourage motorists from stopping and re-fuelling when, for safety reasons, they should."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says the higher prices have not been ""fully explained"" He adds: ""I would welcome a view from the CMA on whether the three private companies that currently operate the majority of MSAs (motorway service areas) are exercising market power to the detriment of motorists."" Moto, Welcome Break and RoadChef run most of the 112 motorway service areas across the UK. According to industry figures published on Thursday, the average price for unleaded petrol at MSAs is 137.7p per litre, compared to a UK average of 120.11p per litre. The average unleaded price at supermarkets is 116.74p. It means filling up the average car with unleaded fuel costs around Â£10 more on the motorway. Mr Grayling pointed to RAC figures from 2011, which showed that average petrol prices then were just 7.5p higher, showing the ""situation had worsened"". He said he understood that MSAs had higher overheads and infrastructure costs, but that their higher prices were ""not fully explained"". In 2013,a study of the UK petrol and diesel marketfound that fuel was significantly more expensive at motorway service stations. The Office of Fair Trading was concerned that motorists were not able to see the prices until they had left the motorway and requested new signs on motorways to display prices. The plans were scrapped after a trial run of the signs producedno evidence of savings. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, welcomed the minister's intervention as ""great news for motorists"". ""We have long called for something to be done about the cost of motorway fuel because there's nothing to justify the sky-high price. ""Drivers filling up motorway services often put in the bare minimum but this can easily backfire. Running out of fuel on a motorway puts lives at risk."" The AA said motorists had for too long been treated like ""hostages"" by MSAs. ""We welcome any move to deter rip-off motorway pump prices,"" the organisation said.

"Barristers are to go on strike over ""relentless"" cuts which have left the criminal justice system ""broken"". The Criminal Bar Association (CBA), which represents criminal lawyers in England and Wales, is advising its members take part in ""days of action"". It also recommends its members refuse all legal aid cases from 1 April when a new fees system comes into force. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the position taken by the CBA. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the CBA, has warned that prisons, courts, the police and probation services were ""underfunded and in chaos"". Hundreds of court cases axed over failings She said a lack of investment meant cases were not being properly investigated by the police and CPS, there was uncertainty and delay at court and ""unnecessary distress"" for witnesses, victims and defendants. She said the recent disclosure crisis, which led to the collapse of a number of rape trials last year, also highlighted ""the appalling state of our system"". She said the Ministry of Justice's ""already meagre and inadequate"" budget would be reduced by  Â£600m by 2019/20. She said underfunding meant the poor and vulnerable were ""being denied access to justice"", members of the public were ""at risk of miscarriages of justice"" and the  faith of the public in the jury system was being undermined by ""the chaos in courts"". ""In 2016, the Public Accounts Committee warned that the criminal justice system was close to breaking point. It is now broken,"" she added. The planned strike is timed to coincide with the introduction of the Advocates' Graduated Fee Scheme (AGFS), which comes in on 1 April and will link the amount barristers are paid for legal aid work to the complexity of a case. The Ministry of Justice said the scheme was cost neutral. However, the CBA said the government's refusal to invest in the scheme was ""the final straw"". It said barristers' fees had been cut by 40% over 20 years and the lack of investment undermined the progress made on diversity and social mobility in the profession. In a ballot of 2,300 of its members - a 55% turnout - 90% voted in favour of action. Prominent legal chambers Doughty Street, Garden Court and 25 Bedford Row are among those set to be involved. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said refusing legal aid briefs would take months to have an effect and it was not clear how solid the strike action would be. However, he said it had potential to cause ""serious disruption"". A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it would continue to engage with the Bar. She said: ""Our reforms will reflect the actual work done in court, representing better value for the taxpayer, and will replace an archaic scheme under which barristers were able to bill by pages of evidence.

"Acrylamide is produced when coffee beans are roasted Coffee sold in California must carry a cancer warning, a court has ruled. The judge in Los Angeles said Starbucks and about 90 other coffee sellers had failed to warn customers about a potentially toxic compound that is produced during the roasting process. The firms were sued by a California-based non profit-group over the chemical acrylamide. The group argued that as acrylamide is regarded as carcinogenic under state law, it should be sold with a warning. Ruling in favour of the Council for Education and Research on Toxics, Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said the companies should not be exempt from the law, as they had failed to prove that the ""consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health"". The companies have until 10 April to appeal the decision. Acrylamide is created when starchy foods are roasted, grilled or fried for long periods at high temperatures. Studies in animals found that the chemical causes tumours. This suggests that it also has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Scientists believe that there should be a margin of exposure of 10,000 or higher between an average adult's intake of acrylamide and the lowest dose which could cause adverse effects. But at the moment the numbers are 425 for the average adult and 50 for the highest consuming toddlers, making it a slight public health concern, UK and European food safety experts say. A statement from the National Coffee Association (NCA) said the industry was considering an appeal. ""Cancer warning labels on coffee would be misleading. The US government's own Dietary Guidelines state that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle,"" the statement said. Coffee drinkers live longer - perhaps Q&A: Acrylamide The lawsuit was filed in 2010 and says coffee sellers should pay fines of up to $2,500 (Â£1,800) for every person exposed to acrylamide in California since 2002. The next phase of the trial will determine the exact penalties, but some companies have reportedly agreed to settle and post warnings about the chemical. The ruling came despite a recent easing of concern about the potential health impact of coffee, which was removed from a list of possible carcinogens by the UN's World Heath Organization in 2016. Last year, a study of almost half a million people from 10 European countries found that drinking three cups of coffee a day may have health benefits. But sceptical experts said it was impossible to say for sure that the coffee was having a protective effect. Q&A: Acrylamide - should we give up toast?

"Katherine Brewster, 27, was reportedly last seen walking barefoot into a forest in Brazil A British woman who went missing from a meditation retreat in Brazil has been found safe and well. Katherine Brewster, 27, from Seaford, in East Sussex, was last seen on Sunday, reportedly walking barefoot into a dense forest. Her mother, Dr Diane Brewster, told BBC South East that she had called home after returning from ""time alone"" in a rural part of Santa Catarina. Ms Brewster was said to have been ""amazed"" upon learning of the search. She is staying with a family in Dom Jose village in Alpestre, who reported her disappearance on Tuesday after she left taking only her passport and credit card, and leaving all her other belongings behind. In aFacebook post,external, Neli da Terra said she was ""a guest for a period of 32 days, in search of a contact with earth and nature, always with a quiet behavior and relationship and without causing any damage to the community and our family"". This was the moment Ms Brewster was reunited with the family she was staying with Marcos Woelz, speaking on behalf of Clairton da Silva, who was involved in the search for Ms Brewster, said: ""We got really scared. The weather was changing fast. We were really worried about her health. ""She was found about 10km away in a very densely populated bush where she found some fruit from other people's plantations.

"Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures Russia has announced further measures against UK diplomats while at the same time declaring tit-for-tat expulsions of officials from 23 other countries. It has told the British ambassador to cut staffing to the size of the Russian mission in the UK. Moscow has rejected UK accusations that it is behind the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter in the UK. However, some 150 Russians have since been expelled by mainly Western countries. Russia initially hit back at the UK, but then announced 60 US expulsions. On Friday it called in a string of foreign ambassadors with news that their own countries' measures were being matched. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury, England, on 4 March. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.Yulia's condition is said to be improving. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". In another development, Russia accused British customs officers of trying to search an Aeroflot airliner arriving from Moscow at London's Heathrow airport without allowing the crew to be present. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment. It's not immediately obvious what it means in practice, but it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history. Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"". It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago. Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US. Twenty-nine countries have expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato has also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond ""in kind"" The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action. On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled. A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. Russia, he said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"". Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? What was the Cold War? Russian spy: The story so far On Friday, in addition to the new Western expulsions, UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow was handed a protest note that said Britain's ""provocative actions"" had led to the decision by other governments to expel Russians. It is not clear how many more British officials will have to leave. Before the expulsion of the 23 Russians, the UK's Foreign Office listed 60 Russian officials working in the UK. Another four are posted at the Russian consulate general in Edinburgh. UK National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill has said expulsions by Western countries are aimed at rooting out covert Russian intelligence networks. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying British ""police"" had boarded the jet once passengers had disembarked and had ""demanded"" the crew leave so that they could conduct a search. The Russian embassy in London said later in a statement that British customs officers had boarded the plane and tried to search it ""without the crew being present"". ""After an Embassy officer arrived at the airport long negotiations were conducted that allowed to ensure the right of the captain to be take part in the search,"" it added. Russia's foreign ministry called it ""the next provocation"" following the fallout from the Skripal affair. There was no immediate official British comment on the Russian accusations but London's Metropolitan Police denied its officers had searched a plane arriving from Moscow. Allow Twitter content?

Britain says the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union known as Novichok. OPCW has sent a team to the UK to investigate samples of the agent Britain says was used. The results are expected to take a minimum of two weeks, the government says. Police say the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at Mr Skripal's home in Salisbury, with the highest concentration found on the front door.

"Russian diplomats are being expelled by more than two dozen countries, following allegations - which it denies - that it poisoned a spy in the UK. How much difference will that make to Russia's extensive international presence? The decision to expel more than 140 diplomats from Russia's embassies will sting - causing it more than just irritation and inconvenience. It has also announced thetit-for-tat expulsions of dozens of diplomats from mainly Western countries. But the numbers involved are a tiny part of Russia's large international presence. Russia has 242 diplomatic posts around the world, with 143 embassies, 87 consulates and 12 other diplomatic missions. Its global network covers 145 countries. In terms of sheer size it ranks fourth in the world, according to theLowy Institute's 2017 Global Diplomacy Index,external, which maps and  ranks 60 of the world's most significant diplomatic networks. Only the United States, China and France have a larger network. The United Kingdom, which ranks seventh on the index, has 225 posts worldwide. Russia is also expanding its network in strategic locations. For example it is significantlyincreasing the size of its Dublin embassy, according to reports.,external Seen in this context, the expulsions appear to be less momentous than at first glance. The co-ordinated actions of the countries that expelled Russian diplomats have been described as the largest in memory. Memories can be short, of course. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, speaks to the media In mid-2017, Russia itself ordered the removal of 755 members of staff from US diplomatic missions in Russia, in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and allegations of interference in the US elections. However, the number of actual diplomats expelled was lower because many staff at the US embassies were Russians employed for domestic and administrative services. Russia, by comparison, does not employ local staff at its missions, probably for security reasons. Nevertheless, the 2017 episode gives an idea of the sheer scale of both countries' diplomatic presence. TheUS State Department has 74,400 employees,external, 13,700 of whom are in the Foreign Service, with 9,400 posted overseas. Russian spy: What we know so far What was the Cold War? What next for Russia's spy networks? Precise numbers for Russia's foreign service are elusive, but it is likely to have several thousand diplomats. This would not include the undeclared or covert intelligence agents working outside the walls of its embassies and consulates. In contrast, the UK's Foreign Office has more than 1,600 diplomats posted overseas. In the UK, 58 Russian diplomats are listed on the UK government'sLondon diplomatic list,external. Britain's expulsion of 23 of these officers, therefore, almost halves the size of Russia's mission in London, although the remaining 35 is still a significant contingent. In the US, which ordered the closure of the Seattle consulate and the expulsion of 60 diplomats, the Washington DC embassy alone has 116 diplomats. People exit the Permanent Russian Mission to the United Nations In addition, Russia has its New York mission to the United Nations - which plays a key role in its international diplomacy - and three consulates, with about 50 officers. There are also cultural offices, trade offices, an information office and a defence, military, naval and air attache office in the US. Russia could be said to be punching above its weight if its diplomatic presence is compared with its global size on most key measures. It has a military budget about a tenth of the size of the US's, and less than half that of China's, but its diplomatic network is almost the same size as both. It has the eighth largest population and the 12th largest economy in terms of GDP. Its extensive diplomatic network reflects both its imperial history as a great power in the 19th Century, as well as its Cold War posture. It has a multitude of posts in Eastern Europe and former communist allies including China, Vietnam, Cuba and Angola, as well as legacies of the former USSR in Africa and Asia. The size of its network reflects the extent of its undiminished global ambition. The expulsions this week, while significant, may therefore pose only a temporary setback for Russia's diplomatic influence. However, having a reduced diplomatic presence in the countries who have expelled Russian officials, plus Nato, will impair its efforts in those countries and reduce its trade and cultural activities. More importantly, though, the cuts may make a sharper dent in its intelligence capabilities, at least in the short term. It's probable that the expulsions focus on known intelligence agents: Australia for exampleexplicitly identified,externaltwo expelled officers as ""undeclared intelligence agents"" - a description the UK also used for all 23 diplomats it expelled. It may take some time for Russia to replace the agents it has lost with new ones, either within embassies, or outside the protection and immunity of its official diplomatic corps. Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? The trouble telling aid workers and foreign fighters apart Are North and South Korea friends again? For Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB agent, the damage to the Russian intelligence gathering capabilities will be keenly felt. Russia's decision to expel UK and US diplomats was followed by action against other countries which had expelled its diplomats. It has warned that further expulsions may yet be announced. These reciprocal expulsions inflict pain on both sides. Russia is the world's largest nation, a permanent member of the Security Council, a top 12 global economy and a leading producer of oil and gas: other countries benefit from having their envoys in Moscow. Meanwhile, the investigation of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is analysing the substance used in the Skripal poisoning, is continuing. Should the results of that investigation provide evidence of Russia's involvement, the rift between Russia and the rest of the world is only likely to widen.

"In the fall-out of the rugby rape trial, do we need to look again at how our legal system operates? It was a case that was too big and burly for the confines of a court room. The rape trial of two Ulster rugby stars played out in a social media thunder storm across the world. There was more mud than a Six Nations match. In the twitter-sphere, there were shockwave revelations, lightning flashes of righteous anger, showers of sheer nastiness, snide comments and plain character assassination. The Belfast trial judge, Patricia Smyth, found herself battling a blizzard to hold the jury under a large, wonky legal umbrella. She warned them again and again to keep away from the press and social media. Jan Melia says Women's Aid has had calls from women who do not want to take their cases forward in the light of the trial All the defendants in the case were cleared of all the charges. As the trial played out over eight and a half weeks, Women's Aid in Northern Ireland felt the tremors. ""We've had phone calls to our helpline from women who have decided to withdraw complaints,""  said chief executive officer Jan Melia. ""They do not want to go through the whole process. They do not want to be treated like that in the court or in the media. ""It was the grilling that she (the complainant) got. ""Then there was that sort of character assassination and the victim blaming - it was the whole media surrounding the case."" Women's Aid supports women whether they choose to take a case forward or not. Ms Melia said: ""The media coverage has demonstrated quite markedly that the process for the victim is excruciating, it punishes them."" There are questions to be asked, she said. ""Is the law adequate? Do we need new media guidelines to avoid putting those involved and their families through this - both the young woman and, also, those accused? ""It adds insults to injury for both sides. We need to look at the law and the process for both sides."" Ms Melia believes there may be a case for a fundamental change to the legal system citing examples of countries where both parties remain anonymous. The fall-out from the rugby rape trial is ""hugely worrying"", she said. ""We know reporting of sexual violence is very low. Women do not call police,"" she says. ""What this case demonstrates is what they are going to go through. It's an awful process in which they are just annihilated."" Ms Melia is concerned about young people's sexual behaviour and attitudes. She has called for mandatory education in schools. Social media has turned everybody with a smart phone into a publisher says Joshua Rozenberg Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said rape cases are ""particularly difficult to try"". ""The question of consent is often one person's word against another,"" he said. ""Establishing consent is particularly difficult when those involved have had a lot to drink."" He pointed out the dangers of social media. ""Members of the public may not realise that, by publishing information on social media about a current case, they are in contempt of court and liable to punishment. ""Social media has turned everybody with a smart phone into a publisher but non-journalists are not aware of the law."" As regards the length of this particular trial, he said that a judge must always keep control of a criminal trial and it can be difficult to decide when to limit cross-examination of a complainant. ""Judges sometimes ask defence barristers to agree among themselves how to divide cross-examination so that a defendant does not have to answer the same questions from different defence lawyers."" Monica McWilliams, an academic and politician who served as Northern Ireland's Human Rights Commissioner, has conducted extensive research into domestic violence. Monica McWilliams says it is time for change This was a standard trial, she pointed out, but it has gone into huge detail. ""Victims watching this may be asking themselves: 'Do I want to put myself up for something as adversarial as that?'"" she said. The courts provide support for complainants, she said. The young woman was seated behind a screen to give her evidence; she was able to observe proceedings and she may have availed of the court's befriending system and the opportunity to leave via a different entrance to avoid ""running the gauntlet"" of a public departure. ""This has been played along legal lines,"" she said, noting that Judge Smyth had been ""very clear"" and did her best, legally, in advising the jury. As for the eight days the complainant spent on the witness stand, Mrs McWilliams said that those accused are ""absolutely entitled to their legal defence"". The four accused: (L-R) Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Rory Harrison, Blane McIlroy, Rory Harrison ""It is tough on the victims when there are multiple defendants,"" she said. For a woman, this can be extremely challenging. Mrs McWilliams is clear: given the flurry and hype around this case, it's time for change, she said. ""We have to start a big awareness campaign. It is the only way. ""We have a Sexual Assault Referral Centre - SARC.  Let people know that this exists. It is fabulous. The victim can come with family or friends. ""We fought for years to get it and it's the only one in Northern Ireland."" However, she does not hold with the view that the fall-out from this case is that it will stop women taking a complaint forward through the judicial system. ""I don't think you can afford to say that - to be so negative,"" she said. In the end, after a marathon of a court trial, there can be no real winners. A defence barrister for one of the accused summed it up in his closing statement: ""The problem for this case is that it is a tragedy for everyone involved,"" he said. ""The defendants, [the complainant] and the three young women who went out for a night and found themselves in the headlines of newspapers.""

"Blane McIlroy, Stuart Olding, Paddy Jackson and Rory Harrison denied all the charges against them In the courtroom, it was all about the bedroom. Day after day, hour after hour, the discussions centred on what happened on Paddy Jackson's bed between 03:30 and 04:30 BST on a Tuesday at the end of June 2016. However, one point was made clear from the outset - this was not a court of morals, this was a court of law. It was irrelevant whether the jury approved of young people, who barely knew each other, being involved in sexual activity in Paddy Jackson's bedroom. The jury's task was to decide whether a crime had been committed. ""I was handled like a piece of meat,"" the young woman at the centre of the case told the court. She was 19 at the time of the alleged assault. ""There was not one bit of my body that they did not touch."" The trial hinged on consent. After nine weeks, the court of law finally reached its conclusions Many people following events from a distance made up their minds before the trial began. Rumours about the case, many of them false and malicious, swirled around Belfast for months. Stories about the woman. Stories about the men. Stories about a video. Even when the trial began in Court 12 and the facts started to emerge, the gossip did not stop. Idle speculation about the case became a new sport around Belfast. Judge Patricia Smyth warned the jury not to listen to ""fireside lawyers"" giving their opinions on social media. In spite of the warning, commentary continued - even from some prominent public figures. The four defendants entered the dock for the first time at 10:47 GMT on Monday 29 January. Paddy Jackson went in first. Stuart Olding sat beside him, then Blane McIlroy, then Rory Harrison, then a security guard. Two days later, the 21-year-old woman who said she had been raped by two of them entered the court. There was no possibility of eye contact: She was shielded by a curtain placed around the witness box. However, there was a camera beside her and her face could be seen on screens around the court. She spoke clearly and confidently. ""It's the best decision I have made,"" she said, about going to the police and reporting the rape allegations. Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding watched her on the screen. They did not react. They waited for their turn to give evidence. First up was Paddy Jackson. He took off his jacket, had a sip of water from a white paper cup, walked the 22 steps towards the witness box and lifted up the Bible. He looked at the court usher and swore an oath to tell the truth. Paddy Jackson has won caps for Ulster and Ireland It was day 27 of the trial. It had all begun back in winter; this was now spring. The suit he had worn on day one had been replaced by a blue jumper and an open-neck shirt. He was witness number 23. The trial was already going on much longer than expected. Five weeks had been set aside; it ended up taking almost twice as long. So what took up so much time? The questioning of the complainant, for a start. The young woman was in the witness box on eight separate days. She started giving evidence on 31 January, and finished on 12 February. Her days in the witness box were not all full days. She was given regular breaks. Nonetheless, she spent a long time answering questions as she faced cross-examination from four separate defence barristers. There were a number of other reasons for the length of the trial. Legal arguments over the admissibility of evidence took up a large amount of time and sickness of jurors delayed proceedings. To try to make up lost time there was a legal rarity, a Saturday sitting of the Crown Court. There was no video of what happened, in spite of the rumours that circulated before the trial. Five different people told the court they were in the bedroom, at some stage, during the night. Every aspect of their evidence was painstakingly explored. Thirty different witnesses gave evidence, including 10 police officers, two doctors and a taxi driver. Such was the level of detail that the underwear the woman wore that night was produced in court, passed around and examined. Dozens of text and WhatsApp messages were scrutinised. The amount of alcohol each person consumed on the night was also analysed. Much was made of the fact that Stuart Olding had 23 drinks - eight cans of Carlsberg, four pints of Guinness, two gin and tonics, five vodka and lemonades, three shots and a beer from the fridge in Paddy Jackson's house. He told the court he was ""pretty drunk but still coherent"". The jury went on a visit to the house but the media were not allowed to go along. Inside Court 12, there were only eight seats for reporters. The rest of the media, many of them from Dublin, had to sit in the public gallery. The trial has been a major news story for its duration Most days, the 100 seats in the public gallery were filled, not just by the friends and family of the four defendants but by onlookers. One man travelled by train from Coleraine every day to watch proceedings. A judge from Texas in the United States came one day, during a trip to Belfast on holiday. By the end of the trial, patience on all sides was wearing thin. The summing-up process took more than a week. There was a final flurry of appeals to the jury. Prosecution barrister Toby Hedworth QC looked at the four defendants then turned to the jury and said: ""The lads. Legends? You decide."" One by one, the four defence barristers said the answer was ""not guilty"". Judge Patricia Smyth had the final word before sending the jury out to deliberate. Their verdicts marked the end of the trial. After nine weeks, the court of law finally reached its conclusions. Now the court of public opinion will, no doubt, have its say.

"Good Friday is about to get better for publicans in the Republic of Ireland. Why? Because they can finally toast the Easter holiday with a pint. For almost a century, selling alcohol had been banned on Good Friday - a legacy of Ireland's Christian traditions. But in January 2018 the Irish parliament passed new legislationwhich means this year will be different. So what's the story for 2018? And who stands to gain from the change? Pubs in the Republic will welcome Easter revellers from 10:30 until closing time at 00:30. Off-licences may see some changes too, with fewer booze-desiring customers stocking up a day in advance. Good Friday is traditionally a popular time for house parties in the Republic, as friends and loved ones gather at home instead of the local boozer. But with the pub doors suddenly open, some may decide they'd rather skip the washing-up. It's good news for tourists seeking a tipple too. On Good Fridays past, hapless foreigners unaware of the drinks ban could be found wandering the streets of Dublin in a futile search for a pint. The most dedicated were even spotted boarding trains or ferries to exploit an infamous loophole - the on-board bar. Ireland country profile Easter is a busy tourist period, and the extra day's trade is set to boost the Irish economy. According to publicans' group the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) - whose interest is clear - it could generate as much as 40m euros (Â£35m; $49m) in sales - plus 7m for the exchequer through VAT and excise duty. ""The Good Friday ban is from a different era,"" the group's chief executive, Padraig Cribben, said. ""Like all other businesses who were never subject to a ban, publicans now have a choice to open."" The Roman Catholic Church held considerable influence in the Republic historically, and some would still prefer an alcohol-free Friday on religious grounds. Back in January, critics said the altered legislation also undermined the government's goal of reducing the harm caused by alcohol. Independent TD (Irish member of parliament) Maureen O'Sullivan spoke frankly, asking: ""Are we saying that the only tourists we want are those who can't last 24 hours without buying a drink in a public house?"" ""I actually think we could do with a few Good Fridays throughout the year,"" she added. Perhaps mindful that not everyone approves of them opening, some hostelries have decided to give their Good Friday takings to charity. And in rural Newmarket, a little town in Cork,the six local publicans put their heads together - and agreed to keep their doors bolted,external. John Scanlon of Scanlon's Bar explained: ""We have only two days off each year, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and we want to hold on to that. It is a day publicans want to spend with their families."" In Northern Ireland pubs can open on Good Friday but may only serve alcohol between 17:00 and 23:00. The hospitality sector has called for the North to have the same options as the Republic. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, believes serving restrictions will cost the North's pubs and restaurants Â£20m,externalin trade over the Easter weekend.

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel Palestinian officials say at least 16 people have been killed by Israeli forces and hundreds more wounded during protests at the Gaza-Israeli border. Thousands had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The Israeli military said soldiers had opened fire after rioting. UN Security Council members meeting in New York have called for an investigation into the violence. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. They are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to homes that are now in Israel. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged the UN Security Council to help provide ""protection for our Palestinian people"". ""I... place full responsibility on the Israeli authorities for the loss of the martyrs who were killed today,"" he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area surrounding Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. Israeli soldiers maintained a close watch on the border protests The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting that included petrol bombs and stones being thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. Israel said it had targeted sites of the Hamas militant group. Israel deployed tanks and snipers. Witnesses said a drone had been used in at least one location to drop tear gas. By Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza The death toll from Friday's rally is the largest since the last Israeli war on Gaza in the summer of 2014. Since then Gaza has seen a long period of calm but difficult economic conditions and the Israeli blockade may be the final chapter in the four-year truce between Hamas and Israel. Despite the call for peaceful demonstrations, the confrontations involving angry Palestinian youths were not surprising. Young men have been demonstrating near the border with Israel on numerous occasions, but this time Israel's response was exaggerated. Tomorrow, the Palestinians will bury their dead and head back to the border with Israel to throw stones at the soldiers. The important question that remains is to what extent will peaceful demonstrations succeed in stopping an impending war, or will the protests lead to military escalation? Hamas, the militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, does not recognise Israel's right to exist but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Addressing protesters on Friday, Hamas senior political leader Ismail Haniyeh said ""we will not concede a single inch of the land of Palestine"". He said: ""There is no alternative to Palestine and no solution except to return."" Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people had been wounded by live ammunition. It said one of those killed was a 16-year-old boy. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reiterated that his organisation would not recognise the Israeli state The Israeli military oversees a no-go zone along the Gaza border, citing security concerns, and has doubled its troop presence for the protest. It fears the protest could be an attempt at a mass breach of the border. Palestinians march to mark Land Day east of Gaza City Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israeli foreign ministry said the protest was a ""deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with Israel"" and responsibility for any clashes lay ""solely with Hamas and other participating Palestinian organisations"". UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council the situation in Gaza ""might deteriorate in the coming days"" and called for civilians, particularly children, to not be targeted, Reuters news agency reports. ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law,"" he said. ""Lethal force should only be used as a last resort with any resulting fatalities properly investigated by the authorities."" Palestinians have erected five main camp areas along the Israel border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. An injured protester is evacuated from Jabaliya The Great March of Return protests started on Friday as 30 March marks Land Day, which commemorates the killing of six protesters by Israeli security forces during demonstrations over land confiscation in 1976. The protest is scheduled to end on 15 May, which Palestinians call Nakba (catastrophe) and which marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians have long demanded their right to return but Israel says they should settle in a future Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

"Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures Russia has announced further measures against UK diplomats while at the same time declaring tit-for-tat expulsions of officials from 23 other countries. It has told the British ambassador to cut staffing to the size of the Russian mission in the UK. Moscow has rejected UK accusations that it is behind the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter in the UK. However, some 150 Russians have since been expelled by mainly Western countries. Russia initially hit back at the UK, but then announced 60 US expulsions. On Friday it called in a string of foreign ambassadors with news that their own countries' measures were being matched. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury, England, on 4 March. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.Yulia's condition is said to be improving. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". In another development, Russia accused British customs officers of trying to search an Aeroflot airliner arriving from Moscow at London's Heathrow airport without allowing the crew to be present. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment. It's not immediately obvious what it means in practice, but it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history. Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"". It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago. Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US. Twenty-nine countries have expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato has also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond ""in kind"" The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action. On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled. A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. Russia, he said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"". Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? What was the Cold War? Russian spy: The story so far On Friday, in addition to the new Western expulsions, UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow was handed a protest note that said Britain's ""provocative actions"" had led to the decision by other governments to expel Russians. It is not clear how many more British officials will have to leave. Before the expulsion of the 23 Russians, the UK's Foreign Office listed 60 Russian officials working in the UK. Another four are posted at the Russian consulate general in Edinburgh. UK National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill has said expulsions by Western countries are aimed at rooting out covert Russian intelligence networks. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying British ""police"" had boarded the jet once passengers had disembarked and had ""demanded"" the crew leave so that they could conduct a search. The Russian embassy in London said later in a statement that British customs officers had boarded the plane and tried to search it ""without the crew being present"". ""After an Embassy officer arrived at the airport long negotiations were conducted that allowed to ensure the right of the captain to be take part in the search,"" it added. Russia's foreign ministry called it ""the next provocation"" following the fallout from the Skripal affair. There was no immediate official British comment on the Russian accusations but London's Metropolitan Police denied its officers had searched a plane arriving from Moscow. Allow Twitter content?

Britain says the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union known as Novichok. OPCW has sent a team to the UK to investigate samples of the agent Britain says was used. The results are expected to take a minimum of two weeks, the government says.

"A police bail limit of 28 days came into force in April 2017 Thousands of suspects under investigation for violent and sexual offences have been released without condition since a 28-day limit on police bail was introduced a year ago. In one three-month period, 12 forces released more than 3,000 violent crime, murder, rape and sexual offences suspects, figures seen by the BBC show. A police watchdog previously warned this could endanger vulnerable victims. The Home Office said it had asked forces to review their use of bail. Under the new measures,which were introduced in England and Wales last April,bail should only be used when deemed ""necessary and proportionate"" and must be limited to 28 days. Extensions of up to three months must be authorised by a senior police officer, and longer periods only granted by a court in exceptional circumstances. The changes were brought in to stop police bailing suspects for extended periods of time without resolution, following a series of high-profile cases. The figures for April to June 2017, disclosed to the BBC under a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, reveal the number of suspects bailed has fallen by two-thirds since the restrictions came into force. Among the suspects released were 1,692 people arrested for violent crimes, 768 rape suspects and 31 questioned on suspicion of murder. Pre-charge bail is when police release an arrested suspect but continue their investigation before deciding whether to charge them. Suspects who are still subject to police inquiries but spared bail conditions are released ""under investigation"" - without a date to report back to authorities. The BBC contacted the 43 forces in England and Wales to find out how many people suspected of violent and sexual offences had been released in this way. The 12 constabularies who provided data were Bedfordshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon and Cornwall, Kent, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Northamptonshire, Surrey, Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Yorkshire. Key findings: Between April and June last year 6,683 suspected violent and sexual offenders were released without further action, 2,430 were charged and 3,149 released under investigation. Of those released under investigation, 1,692 were suspected of violent crimes; 31 murder; 22 attempted murder; four manslaughter; 768 rape and 632 other sexual offences. 732 were bailed, an average of 244 per month, compared with 938 in March, before the measures were implemented. Last week, England and Wales' policing watchdog HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMICFRS) said vulnerable victims could be put at risk by suspects who were released without bail conditions. The BBC findings reinforced HMICFRS research that found the use of bail had fallen by 65% and in suspected domestic abuse cases by 75%. Zoe Billingham, inspector of constabulary, said a ""blanket"" ban on bail use had emerged, potentially putting vulnerable people, like domestic violence victims, at risk. ""Bail is a demonstration that someone is looking out for them,"" she told the BBC. ""The pendulum has swung too far in one direction, we suspect,"" she said, adding there had been ""a lack of direction"" about the new arrangements. The charity Women's Aid described the figures as ""shocking"" and ""alarming"", saying it had warned the Home Office the reforms could have a ""negative impact"" on the protection and safety of domestic abuse survivors. A spokeswoman said: ""We need certainty that the police are applying bail conditions in domestic abuse cases. ""There needs to be clear understanding of the risk and threat of harm to domestic abuse victims."" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) recognised that concerns ""have been raised"" about the bail reforms and welcomed the HMICFRS' recommendations. NPCC lead for bail management, Assistant Chief Constable Darren Martland, added that the implementation of the changes were under ""constant review."" Prior to their implementation, theCollege of Policing branded the reform plans ""dangerous"". The Home Office said a large drop in the use of bail was expected but should not affect the police response to incidents of domestic abuse. It said conditional pre-charge bail ""continues to be available where it is necessary and proportionate, such as to protect victims and witnesses"".

"Christine Shawcroft resigned as head of the disputes committee but MPs say she should be sacked from Labour's governing body A group of 39 Labour politicians have called on Jeremy Corbyn to suspend the party's former disputes chief amid the ongoing row over anti-Semitism. In an open letter, MPs and peers called for Christine Shawcroft to be suspended from the National Executive Committee. Ms Shawcrofthad quit as head of Labour's disputes panelafter she sent an email showing support for a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. It comes as Mr Corbyn faces continued pressure to tackle anti-Semitism. The letter, which is signed by 39 Labour politicians, said it was ""utterly wrong"" and ""highly offensive to the Jewish community"" that Ms Shawcroft remained a member of the NEC, which is Labour's governing body. The lead signatory of the letter, the MP Siobhain McDonagh, told the BBC the group felt ""very strongly"" about the issue and that she and her colleagues had been ""shocked to the core"". How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded 'Deeply sorry' Christine Shawcroft quits as Labour disputes chief Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue Ms Shawcroft, who is a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, quit as head of the party's disputes panel on Wednesday after it emerged she had sent an email opposing the suspension of council candidate Alan Bull. Mr Bull had been due to stand in the May local elections but is accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. Ms Shawcroft said she had not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" online post and said she was ""deeply sorry"". In the letter, seen by the BBC on Thursday night, the Labour figures urged Mr Corbyn to take an ""initial step"" in honouring his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism. The BBC understands Mr Corbyn intends to announce a speeding-up of the party's disciplinary procedures. He has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, particularly in the past week following fresh accusations of anti-Jewish prejudice afterit emerged he sent an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. The remarksled to a protest outside Parliament,organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council and attended by several Labour MPs, calling on Mr Corbyn to ""root out"" anti-Semitism in the party. Luciana Berger MP, who has signed the letter, joined a demonstration in London against anti-Semitism in Labour earlier in the week Mr Corbyn previously acknowledged anti-Semitism had surfaced within Labour, promised to deal with allegations of abuse more quickly andpledged to ""rebuild"" confidence in the party among the Jewish community. According to the BBC's political correspondent Jonathan Blake, some of his supporters say the issue is being used to destabilise him. Mr Corbyn's office has offered no response to the letter.

"GKN is a partner on the F-35 joint strike aircraft The government will assess whether the takeover of British engineering giant GKN raises public interest concerns, the business secretary has said. Shareholders have accepted a hostile bid of Â£8.1bn from investment firm Melrose Industries. Unions want the deal to be blocked on national security grounds. Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would not give a view until he had considered all the evidence. The battle for GKN, which employs 58,000 staff worldwide - 6,000 of them in the UK - drew protests from government, unions and GKN customers. Why the the GKN bid battle matters Labour called Melrose a ""short-termist asset-stripper"" and condemned the deal for one of Britain's oldest engineering firms, which has had a hand in making everything from Minis to Spitfires. Melrose Industries, which specialises in turning round troubled manufacturing businesses and selling them on, won the backing of 52% of GKN shareholders. The British firm has promised to keep the company headquarters in the UK, maintain current levels of R&D spending, and to not sell the aerospace business for five years. Mr Clark said it was ""good"" Melrose had made those ""legally binding"" commitments but the government now had a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger gives rise to public interest concerns. Lord Heseltine, the former defence secretary, said it should be stopped on national security grounds, adding that ""no other country of our sort would have allowed this to happen"". There are worries that Melrose could sell GKN's aerospace business, which is involved in defence programmes, to an overseas buyer in the future. However, Mr Clark refused to be drawn on whether he believed there were national security concerns about the bid because he needs to act ""objectively"". He also dismissed Lord Heseltine's claims that other countries would block such a takeover, saying ""our practice is very consistent with those of other competitors"". He added that the shareholders had made their choice and ""decided they want a new management"". He also played down concerns over speculators buying up shares to swing the vote, saying investors who had recently sold up had effectively chosen not to back the company's management. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn wrote on Twitter,externalthat the Conservatives ""had put the interests of City speculators over people's jobs"" and a Labour government would have stopped the takeover. By BBC Business reporter Rob Young Airbus has said new business with GKN after a Melrose takeover would be ""practically impossible"" The business secretary has defended the existing rules governing takeovers, and is clearly pleased with the guarantees he managed to get out of Melrose. Listening to Greg Clark's radio interview, it was clear he thinks shareholders should determine the fate of the companies they own. He said it is the ""narrow question"" of national security that he will consider. Would Melrose's (five-year?) ownership of GKN threaten UK national security? Unions think so. However, the vast majority of GKN's work is for civilian purposes, not military. GKN is not listed as one of the Ministry of Defence's top 50 suppliers. But it makes components for the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet (made by BAE and Airbus) and the A400M military aircraft (made by Airbus). GKN's US defence business is much more significant. A US committee is still determining whether to give approval to Melrose to act as a provider to the US military. Melrose clearly expects it will get that approval. Could the US say ""yes"" and the UK ""no""? Some City analysts doubt a national security argument can be made to block this takeover. Admitting defeat, GKN's management said it would now work with Melrose to ensure the success of the new company. GKN's board had promised it would overhaul itself and sell off its car parts division, but it was not enough to stop investors agreeing to sell their shares to Melrose. Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said: ""We are delighted and grateful to have received support from GKN shareholders for our plan to create a UK industrial powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over Â£10bn and a tremendous future."" News of the successful bid sent GKN's share price up over 6% to 450p. Melrose's offer is equivalent to 462p a share. GKN's businesses cover aerospace and automotive engineering. Its Driveline division makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. Its aerospace division is a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake. GKN Driveline supplies some of the world's biggest car manufacturers Unite union's assistant secretary general, Steve Turner, said Mr Clark should use legal powers to intervene in the deal. Before Melrose won the bid, Airbus, which is supplied by GKN, said it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to GKN if Melrose's offer was accepted because it damaged long-term investment prospects in the company, which could reduce R&D budgets and limit innovation. Melrose launched its bid in January, initially at Â£7bn. It increased that this month to Â£8.1bn, with up to another Â£1bn to support the pension fund. It argued that it could increase GKN's profitability which has been falling steadily over the last five years. In the run up to the bid, GKN had also suffered a crisis of leadership, with its chief executive-in-waiting, Kevin Cummings, forced to step down after problems in the company's US aerospace division. The new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former Ford executive, devised a plan to merge GKN's Driveline with the US car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would have got a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (Â£1.28bn) in cash from Dana. But Melrose called the plans ""panicked and fraught with contradictions"".

"Stars including Coleen Nolan and breast cancer survivor Victoria Derbyshire have been hailed ""warrior women"" for baring all for breast cancer awareness. Eight women took part in The Real Full Monty: Ladies' Night, stripping off in front of a live audience. Those chosen have all been affected by cancer. They were seen on the ITV show dancing to This Is Me from The Greatest Showman in a routine choreographed by Diversity's Ashley Banjo. The group included cancer survivor Ruth Madoc, the actress, and singer and presenter Michelle Heaton, who had a double mastectomy after learning she has the BRCA2 gene. Actress Helen Lederer also took part, along with DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford, Emmerdale's Sally Dexter and Towie's Megan McKenna. They were assembled by Loose Women's Nolan, whose sister Bernie died of breast cancer in 2013. Another sister, Linda, is now battling the condition. ""I'm here and one of my sisters isn't - and one of them is going through hell again,"" she said. ""I'm doing it for them."" Derbyshire became emotional during the show Derbyshire was initially uncertain about taking part, breaking down on the first day of rehearsals saying: ""This is so out of my comfort zone. God, this is day one, what the heck. ""I haven't cried for ages about having cancer, or my body or whatever."" It was also an emotional experience for Heaton, who talked about her reconstructed breasts, saying she felt ""disconnected"" from them. They also took part in a Calendar Girls-inspired photoshoot, with food items covering their bare breasts, to increase their confidence. The women took part in a Calendar Girls photoshoot during the documentary On the big night, the women took to the stage in Sheffield in bronze sequinned wrap dresses - halfway through, they pulled off the dresses to show tasselled black lingerie, which they accessorised with red feather fans. Turning away from the crowds, they removed their bras and covered themselves with the feathers, before then facing the audience - and removing the feathers. The final shot was filmed from behind. It proved emotional for all of the women, with Derbyshire and Nolan sharing a hug as the performance drew to a close. Derbyshire said the programme, which followed a male version of the show featuring the likes of James Argent and John Partridge, had made her ""really happy"". ""There might be someone watching who learns something about breast cancer that they didn't know before and it might save their life and that is massive,"" she added. Heaton said she felt ""overwhelmed"" after the experience,adding on Twitter,external: ""#TheRealFullMontyladies has been the best thing I've ever done to help overcome my fears and raise #BreastCancerAwareness."" There was praise and admiration from the audience after the show aired on ITV1 on Thursday night. Viewer Vikki Longman said it made her feel ""empowered"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Clashes took place along Gaza's border with Israel Palestinian officials say at least 16 people have been killed by Israeli forces and hundreds more wounded during protests at the Gaza-Israeli border. Thousands had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The Israeli military said soldiers had opened fire after rioting. UN Security Council members meeting in New York have called for an investigation into the violence. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. They are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to homes that are now in Israel. Who are Hamas? Has Hamas changed? Will unity deal end Palestinian feud? Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged the UN Security Council to help provide ""protection for our Palestinian people"". ""I... place full responsibility on the Israeli authorities for the loss of the martyrs who were killed today,"" he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. It said it had ""enforced a closed military zone"" in the area surrounding Gaza. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. Israeli soldiers maintained a close watch on the border protests The IDF said troops were ""firing towards the main instigators"" to break up rioting that included petrol bombs and stones being thrown at the fence. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. Israel said it had targeted sites of the Hamas militant group. Israel deployed tanks and snipers. Witnesses said a drone had been used in at least one location to drop tear gas. By Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza The death toll from Friday's rally is the largest since the last Israeli war on Gaza in the summer of 2014. Since then Gaza has seen a long period of calm but difficult economic conditions and the Israeli blockade may be the final chapter in the four-year truce between Hamas and Israel. Despite the call for peaceful demonstrations, the confrontations involving angry Palestinian youths were not surprising. Young men have been demonstrating near the border with Israel on numerous occasions, but this time Israel's response was exaggerated. Tomorrow, the Palestinians will bury their dead and head back to the border with Israel to throw stones at the soldiers. The important question that remains is to what extent will peaceful demonstrations succeed in stopping an impending war, or will the protests lead to military escalation? Hamas, the militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, does not recognise Israel's right to exist but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Addressing protesters on Friday, Hamas senior political leader Ismail Haniyeh said ""we will not concede a single inch of the land of Palestine"". He said: ""There is no alternative to Palestine and no solution except to return."" Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people had been wounded by live ammunition. It said one of those killed was a 16-year-old boy. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reiterated that his organisation would not recognise the Israeli state The Israeli military oversees a no-go zone along the Gaza border, citing security concerns, and has doubled its troop presence for the protest. It fears the protest could be an attempt at a mass breach of the border. Palestinians march to mark Land Day east of Gaza City Map showing the position of the five protest camps. Source: Haaretz The Israeli foreign ministry said the protest was a ""deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with Israel"" and responsibility for any clashes lay ""solely with Hamas and other participating Palestinian organisations"". UN deputy political affairs chief Taye-Brook Zerihoun told the council the situation in Gaza ""might deteriorate in the coming days"" and called for civilians, particularly children, to not be targeted, Reuters news agency reports. ""Israel must uphold its responsibilities under international human rights and humanitarian law,"" he said. ""Lethal force should only be used as a last resort with any resulting fatalities properly investigated by the authorities."" Palestinians have erected five main camp areas along the Israel border for the protest, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah near the Egyptian border. An injured protester is evacuated from Jabaliya The Great March of Return protests started on Friday as 30 March marks Land Day, which commemorates the killing of six protesters by Israeli security forces during demonstrations over land confiscation in 1976. The protest is scheduled to end on 15 May, which Palestinians call Nakba (catastrophe) and which marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians have long demanded their right to return but Israel says they should settle in a future Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

Greg Beales, campaigns director at homelessness charity Shelter, said that while the new measures would make ""a genuine difference"", most people become homeless because they cannot afford anywhere to live - ""a situation made far worse by welfare cuts"". The government's strategy should include ""building more social homes to rent, and making sure housing benefit is fit for purpose,"" he added. This was echoed by shadow housing secretary John Healey, who said: ""You can't help the homeless if you won't provide the homes, and the money announced here is less than 1% of the Conservatives' annual cut to funding for new low-cost housing.""

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis said there was no end in sight for many on bail A 28-day limit on police bail has come into force in England and Wales. The move follows criticism of people being kept on police bail for months or years without charge in investigations such as Operation Yewtree - into historical sexual abuse - and others. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the reforms brought ""much-needed safeguards"" over police bail. The Police Federation of England and Wales said the limit will mean a ""massive change"" in custody culture. Police bail can still be extended for up to three months more in complex cases with the authorisation of a senior police officer, or even further by applying to a magistrate. Police use pre-charge bail when they have questioned a suspect, but need time to continue their investigations before determining whether to charge them. A suspect is released from custody, sometimes with conditions attached, and told to report back to a police station at a later date. Previously, there was no legal limit on how long someone could be bailed for. The 28-day limit is one of several measures taking effect on Monday through thePolicing and Crime Act 2017,external. The limit is designed to reduce the amount of time people spend on police bail and strengthen safeguards for suspects. In a number of high-profile cases suspects were kept waiting for long periods of time before being told whether they would be charged. In 2015,broadcaster Paul Gambaccini- who was once held on police bail for a year - backed the 28-day limit. In 2013, Mr Gambaccini was arrested on suspicion of historical sexual abuse but the case against him was dropped. The Home Office said the change ""brings an end to the injustice of people being left to languish on very lengthy periods of pre-charge bail"". Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Pre-charge bail is a useful and necessary tool but in many cases it is being imposed on people for many months, or even years, without any judicial oversight - and that cannot be right. ""These important reforms will mean fewer people are placed on bail and for shorter periods. ""They will bring about much-needed safeguards - public accountability and independent scrutiny - while ensuring the police can continue to do their vital work."" The College of Policingpreviously criticised the proposals, warning it could hamper communication between police forces about potentially dangerous suspects. David Tucker, crime lead at the college, said: ""The new legislation is a significant change for policing and has sought to strike a balance between the need for police to manage investigations and not leaving a person suspected of a crime on bail for an unacceptably long period. ""We recognise this is a major change for policing and we are supporting our members by providing high-quality training materials to help them continue to manage investigations to bring criminals to justice and protect the public."" Andy Ward, deputy general secretary of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the new limit could be unrealistic in complicated investigations. He added: ""Cyber-crime, for example, requires computers to be seized and equipment to be interrogated to gain evidence. ""The results for detailed forensic tests also take some time to come back.""

"This video can not be played Prince of Wales delivers Easter message The Prince of Wales has drawn attention to people suffering religious persecution in a televised Easter message. The prince said he was ""deeply moved"" by the courage of those who forgave their persecutors. The message was addressed to people of all faiths around the world. ""My heart goes out to all who, this day, whatever their beliefs, are being persecuted on religious grounds,"" he said. He continued: ""At this time of Easter, when our minds are recalled to the suffering of our Lord 2,000 years ago, we think especially of those Christians who are suffering for their faith in many places around the world. ""Over the years I have met many who have had to flee for their faith and for their life or have somehow endured the terrifying consequences of remaining in their country. ""I have been so deeply moved and humbled by their truly remarkable courage and their selfless capacity for forgiveness despite all they have suffered."" By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent One day he will be king and he knows that from that moment his freedom to speak out on issues will be constrained. Until that moment arrives, Charles feels he has an obligation to attempt to raise awareness about matters that concern him. One such issue is the plight of Christians who are persecuted in different parts of the world and particularly in Syria and Iraq. Charles has had several meetings in recent months at Clarence House with Christian Church leaders from the Middle East. They've told him of the intense difficulties being experienced by members of the Christian faith: their churches are being destroyed and their freedom to worship violated. Charles has long been a champion of inter-faith dialogue. He also has a genuine interest in the teachings of Islam and Judaism which, with Christianity, are the main ""Abrahamic faiths"". Hence his Easter appeal: it is both a condemnation of those whose ""barbaric grip"" distorts faith, and an appeal for greater tolerance and understanding between people of different faiths. The prince went on to say of Judaism, Christianity and Islam: ""All three Abrahamic faiths have known and continue to know the bitterness of persecution when religion has fallen into the barbaric grip of those who distort and misrepresent faith."" Clarence House said the prince's message was inspired by his recent meetings with Christian Church leaders from the Middle East including the Coptic Pope. The prince concluded his message by urging people to show love for those around them. ""Jesus summarises the 10 commandments into two requirements: that we should love God and love our neighbour as ourselves,"" he said. ""It is therefore my special prayer this Eastertide that they will be your guide and your inspiration.""

From April, councils in England will be legally obliged to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need such as vulnerable people or families with children.

Currently, the threat of homelessness is defined as starting 28 days before the person loses their home. Homeless by the sea Almost 30,000 lone parent families made homeless New homelessness law: What impact will it have? Greg Beales, campaigns director at homelessness charity Shelter, said that while the new measures would make ""a genuine difference"", most people become homeless because they cannot afford anywhere to live - ""a situation made far worse by welfare cuts"". The government's strategy should include ""building more social homes to rent, and making sure housing benefit is fit for purpose,"" he added. This was echoed by shadow housing secretary John Healey, who said: ""You can't help the homeless if you won't provide the homes, and the money announced here is less than 1% of the Conservatives' annual cut to funding for new low-cost housing.""

"Emmanuel Macron said he hoped his country could help establish a dialogue France has offered to mediate in the conflict in northern Syria, where Turkey launched a military offensive against Kurdish fighters in January. Ankara is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The French offer was swiftly dismissed by a Turkish presidential spokesman. Ibrahim Kalin said countries should instead take a ""clear stance against all types of terrorism"". Separately on Friday, Turkey said five soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by the PKK in the south-eastern province of Siirt.

France has suffered a series of deadly terror attacks claimed by IS in recent years, includingthe Paris attacks which killed 130 people in 2015. A week ago an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, includinga police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage. Mr Kalin replied on Twitter, restating the Turkish position that the PKK and YPG were trying to legitimise themselves under the SDF. He wrote: ""We reject any efforts to promote 'dialogue', 'contact' or 'mediation' between Turkey and those terrorist organisations."" He said ""friendly countries"" should not ""legitimise the structure of terror"". Earlier this month Turkey ousted Kurdish fighters from the Syrian-Kurdish city of Afrin.

"Kay stars alongside Sian Gibson in Car Share The final two episodes of Peter Kay's Car Share are to be broadcast on BBC One in May, it's been confirmed. Fans of the sitcom will finally see what happens between his character John and Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. The episodes - which have already been filmed - will come a year after Kay said the show wascoming to an endfollowing its second series. There will be an unscripted episode before the finale, which will reveal if John and Kayleigh have a happy ending. A charity screening of the two episodes is taking place in Blackpool next month before the rest of the UK gets to watch them, a tweet from Peter Kay's account announced on Thursday. It was the first tweet from the account since Kay said in December that he wascancelling his comeback tour- his first tour in eight years - due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".

Will John and Kayleigh finally have a happy ending? The second series of Car Share ended with Kayleigh declaring her love for John. When he refused to say how he felt, she walked out of his car - and his life. The ending surprised and disappointed many viewers, who were convinced the show, about two employees thrown together in a company car share scheme, was building up to a romantic finish. Kay admittedin November that people had been ""angry"" about how the series had ended. At the time, he described Car Share Unscripted as ""half an hour of us basically making the script up and improvising,"" adding: ""It's nothing to do with the story - just us having a laugh.""

"Christine Shawcroft resigned as head of the disputes committee but MPs say she should be sacked from Labour's governing body A group of 39 Labour politicians have called on Jeremy Corbyn to suspend the party's former disputes chief amid the ongoing row over anti-Semitism. In an open letter, MPs and peers called for Christine Shawcroft to be suspended from the National Executive Committee. Ms Shawcrofthad quit as head of Labour's disputes panelafter she sent an email showing support for a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. It comes as Mr Corbyn faces continued pressure to tackle anti-Semitism. The letter, which is signed by 39 Labour politicians, said it was ""utterly wrong"" and ""highly offensive to the Jewish community"" that Ms Shawcroft remained a member of the NEC, which is Labour's governing body. The lead signatory of the letter, the MP Siobhain McDonagh, told the BBC the group felt ""very strongly"" about the issue and that she and her colleagues had been ""shocked to the core"". How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded 'Deeply sorry' Christine Shawcroft quits as Labour disputes chief Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue Ms Shawcroft, who is a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, quit as head of the party's disputes panel on Wednesday after it emerged she had sent an email opposing the suspension of council candidate Alan Bull. Mr Bull had been due to stand in the May local elections but is accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. Ms Shawcroft said she had not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" online post and said she was ""deeply sorry"". In the letter, seen by the BBC on Thursday night, the Labour figures urged Mr Corbyn to take an ""initial step"" in honouring his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism. The BBC understands Mr Corbyn intends to announce a speeding-up of the party's disciplinary procedures. He has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, particularly in the past week following fresh accusations of anti-Jewish prejudice afterit emerged he sent an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. The remarksled to a protest outside Parliament,organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council and attended by several Labour MPs, calling on Mr Corbyn to ""root out"" anti-Semitism in the party. Luciana Berger MP, who has signed the letter, joined a demonstration in London against anti-Semitism in Labour earlier in the week Mr Corbyn previously acknowledged anti-Semitism had surfaced within Labour, promised to deal with allegations of abuse more quickly andpledged to ""rebuild"" confidence in the party among the Jewish community. According to the BBC's political correspondent Jonathan Blake, some of his supporters say the issue is being used to destabilise him. Mr Corbyn's office has offered no response to the letter.

"Easter holidaymakers should now be safer from hidden charges when hiring a car, competition authorities say. Action was prompted by a review of the car rental industry which found many firms were advertising low prices by hiding key extra costs. Some 30 leading UK websites have now promised to show clear pricing, including compulsory costs in quotes. Another 20 websites, accounting for 1% of the market, have been sent warning letters. Consumer protection law requires transparent pricing, which includes all compulsory costs. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has overseen various improvements ensuring that charges such as fuel surcharges, young driver fees, and out-of-hours pick up charges are made clear. The CMA claimed it had ""vastly improved"" the sector. Now it said it was taking enforcement action against car hire companies based overseas but selling directly to UK customers online. ""This move sends a clear message: just because a business is not on UK soil doesn't mean the law doesn't apply when it sells in the UK,"" said Michael Grenfell, director for enforcement at the CMA. The announcement comes as data collected by the UK European Consumer Centre between March 2017 and February 2018 showed a 36% increase in complaints and inquiries from UK consumers compared with the previous year. Complaints have included hidden charges for fuel, high insurance excess, and other hidden insurance costs. Leon Livermore, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: ""UK consumers have enough to contend with without worrying about hidden charges for car services.

"Easter holidaymakers should now be safer from hidden charges when hiring a car, competition authorities say. Action was prompted by a review of the car rental industry which found many firms were advertising low prices by hiding key extra costs. Some 30 leading UK websites have now promised to show clear pricing, including compulsory costs in quotes. Another 20 websites, accounting for 1% of the market, have been sent warning letters. Consumer protection law requires transparent pricing, which includes all compulsory costs. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has overseen various improvements ensuring that charges such as fuel surcharges, young driver fees, and out-of-hours pick up charges are made clear. The CMA claimed it had ""vastly improved"" the sector. Now it said it was taking enforcement action against car hire companies based overseas but selling directly to UK customers online. ""This move sends a clear message: just because a business is not on UK soil doesn't mean the law doesn't apply when it sells in the UK,"" said Michael Grenfell, director for enforcement at the CMA. The announcement comes as data collected by the UK European Consumer Centre between March 2017 and February 2018 showed a 36% increase in complaints and inquiries from UK consumers compared with the previous year. Complaints have included hidden charges for fuel, high insurance excess, and other hidden insurance costs. Leon Livermore, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: ""UK consumers have enough to contend with without worrying about hidden charges for car services. The CMA guidance and action will ensure businesses are transparent and upfront so that consumers can make an informed decision.""

"With a year to go before the UK leaves the EU, there are plenty of questions about Brexit still unanswered. As negotiators continue to hammer out the details of the withdrawal agreement and start to outline the future relationship, many are wondering what will change and what will stay the same. Here are some of the questions posed by the BBC audience. Mrs T Conlin, Loddon, Norfolk The short answer is no. As I'm sure you know, there's no such thing as an EU passport and you are an EU citizen only because you have a passport from one of the 28 member states. In effect your UK passport gives you a number of rights and guarantees, including the ability to move freely between EU countries to work, live or study. But if, as expected, the UK leaves the EU on schedule on 29 March 2019, it will then become ""a third country"". At that point you'd no longer be a citizen of an EU country and consequently no longer an EU citizen. Things won't change much for a while because the UK and the EU have reached agreement in principle that there should be a transition period between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 during which all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that you'd enjoy exactly the same rights and guarantees as before. But a word of warning on the transition (or implementation period as the government prefers to call it): it is part of the overall withdrawal agreement and will come into effect only if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both the EU and the UK before Brexit day. The uncertainty around citizens' rights has led to tens of thousands more UK citizens applying for citizenship in other EU countries in the 12 months after the Brexit vote than in the previous year,according to data obtained by the BBC last year. But not everyone has the right (through family links or residency) to do that. Martin Buchanâ via Twitter In theory we could leave tomorrow if Parliament simply repealed the European Communities Act, the legislation that took us in to the EU (or the EEC as it then was) in the first place. But that isn't going to happen. First of all it would probably put the UK in breach of both EU and international law. Secondly, the government doesn't want to leave straight away and neither do the vast majority of MPs. Why not? Because that would take us off the ""cliff edge"" that you may have heard about. Leaving without any withdrawal agreement in place, and no discussion of the future trade or security relationship, would be the hardest of hard Brexits. Don't forget, we've been in the EU for 45 years, and untangling that relationship is incredibly complicated. That's why many people describe what's going on at the moment as the most complex negotiation in modern history. A ""cliff edge"" Brexit - without any new structures to replace the old EU ones - could in the short term see no flights between the EU and the UK, lorries and people stuck at border crossings, imports and exports of food rotting at the border and huge delays in the movement of vital supplies such as medicines, not to mention the impact on restaurants, manufacturing, tourism and other sectors. Chaos, in other words. So is no deal really better than a bad deal? There are those who argue that no deal would be the worst deal of all. The rhetoric is all part of the give and take of negotiation, of course, and the government wants to make the process of withdrawal as smooth as possible. That is why it has also agreed in principle to a transition (or implementation) period for 21 months after Brexit to give more time to get all those new structures in place. Michael Jones, Swindon As soon as the UK leaves the EU, the 73 UK MEPs who were elected by UK voters will lose their seats. That means there will no longer be any UK representation in theEuropean Parliament,external, even during the transition period after Brexit, when the UK will still have to follow all EU rules and regulations. All MEPs are paid out of the EU budget, rather than from their national budgets. So in that sense there'll be no direct saving to the UK taxpayer when the UK MEPs leave - but obviously the UK pays its share of the EU budget. Once the transition period is over, at the end of 2020, the UK will pay only for specific things and the salaries of MEPs will not be one of them. Bearing all that in mind, here is a quick calculation. The current gross salary for an MEP is â¬8,611 per month. So, the total gross cost of all UK MEP salaries (at current exchange rates) is just over Â£6.6m per year. But MEPs also get substantial allowances for staff and travel and office costs, so the total saving will be considerably higher. It's also worth pointing out that all MEPs who stand down or lose their seats are entitled to a payment of one month's salary for each year they served, to a maximum of 24 months. If an MEP takes a mandate in another parliament or another public office, or if he or she retires, they are not entitled to this payment. Two current UK MEPs have already served for more than 24 years - David Martin (Labour) and James Nicholson (Ulster Unionist Party). Among those who will have served for nearly 20 years by the time the UK is due to leave the EU next year are arch-Brexiteers Nigel Farage (UKIP) and Daniel Hannan (Conservative). It is not clear at this stage who will meet these severance payments for departing UK MEPs: the UK government or the EU. This is yet another detail that has to be decided before 29 March 2019. And in terms of overall savings, remember the UK will be paying into EU pension pots, including the one for MEPs, for many years to come. Nigel Patrickâ via Twitter Yes, you will still be able to play the EuroMillions lottery and Brexit will not affect that. The bad news is that Brexit is highly unlikely to increase your chances of winning. EuroMillions might sound like it is run by the EU or by the countries that use the euro, but it has nothing to do with either. The game is based on an agreement between the official lottery operators of nine countries, one of which - Switzerland - is not a member of the EU. The eight EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, France, Republic of Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and the UK (for now). Elizabeth Those rights will certainly change, but they may not disappear entirely. Currently, any British student can study at a university in any EU member state, provided he or she fulfils the entry requirements of that institution. The rules also say that all EU nationals are entitled to use a host country's education system on the same terms as its own nationals. So a British student will pay the same tuition fees as the national of that country or no fee at all, if that's the case for the home students there. Six things to watch if Brexit puzzles you Brexit: All you need to know (By the way, the fact that students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay more than students from elsewhere in the EU to study in Scotland is down to devolved UK law, it's nothing to do with the EU.) But back to the question itself: the UK and the EU have agreed in principle that any UK citizen who moves to study in another EU country before Brexit (due to happen on 29 March 2019), as well as during the transition period after Brexit (due to run until the end of 2020), will retain the right to study on the same terms as that country's own nationals. Again that assumes that the withdrawal agreement is implemented and the transition goes ahead. And it's worth bearing in mind that as long as you start your course before the transition ends, you will still pay local rates even if your course continues after the transition is over. What about those who want to start studying in the EU after the transition - in 2021 and beyond?  Well, that is likely to depend on the policy that each individual country has on tuition fees for non-EU students. Germany, for example, abolished university fees in 2014, and all students - German, EU or non-EU - can study there for free or for a small fee that mainly covers administration costs. So you are likely to be able to study on exactly the same terms in Germany, unless Germany decides to change its own domestic law. But in some other countries the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper tuition fees will no longer be available. Ghene Snowdonâ via Twitter We could well lose free mobile roaming, but it is hard to give a definitive answer at this stage. If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 with a withdrawal agreement in place, then it won't happen immediately. All EU rules and regulations, including on free mobile roaming anywhere in the EU, will continue to apply until the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020. It's also possible that the transition period could be extended, but that's fairly speculative at this stage. So what will happen to free mobile roaming once the transition period is over? Well at that point, EU laws will no longer apply to the UK and UK mobile network operators will be able to reintroduce roaming charges if they so wish. Some major operators say they currently have no plans to do so, but that can't be guaranteed and it's bound to be affected by the commercial decisions taken at the time by both EU and UK operators. It's also possible that the UK government could create its own laws regulating roaming fees after Brexit. But we don't know if it would, and even if it did any such law would probably have to take the form of an agreement with the EU. In other words, it would depend on a future UK-EU future trade deal that has yet to be negotiated. Stephane Caussin, London There has been no estimate published for the overall cost of replacing EU agencies and it would be difficult to come up with one. But it won't be cheap. There are dozens of EU agencies that the UK currently relies upon, regulating everything from aviation and maritime safety, through chemicals and pharmaceuticals, to food and drink. Some people might say we don't need them, it's all just excessive bureaucracy. But without regulations on airline safety your planes can't take off, and without regulations on pharmaceuticals you can't buy and sell medicines. So it does matter. Building new institutions from scratch, training staff and developing expertise, will take considerable time and money. For example, ADS - the lobby group for the aerospace industry - estimates that replacing the work the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) does in the UK would cost about Â£400m over 10 years. But one reason why it's hard to say how much money could be spent overall on new regulators is that the UK government doesn't want to duplicate the work of all EU agencies. It says it would like to continue to participate in some of them after Brexit and it is prepared to pay the EU for that. In fact, in herMansion House speech earlier this month,external, Prime Minister Theresa May said EASA was one the agencies the UK wanted to remain part of. Two others she mentioned were theEuropean Medicines Agency,externaland theEuropean Chemicals Agency,external. Full UK membership is not on the cards, so the UK wants to explore some form of associate membership. The trouble is that for many people in the EU that looks like another form of UK cherry-picking. It also raises questions about the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU agencies. The UK hopes such doubts can be overcome, but it all remains to be negotiated. One of the arguments made by supporters of Brexit is that they want to be free to regulate some things in a different way - to meet the needs of an economy that is changing fast. But it will certainly cost plenty of money to set up a new system. Update 5 April 2018: this article has been updated to reflect the fact that leaving the EU straight away would probably put the UK in breach of EU and international law.

"It's been more than two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the negotiations, pronouncements and progress reports seem never-ending. So while there's just over six months until Brexit day, with a 21-month transition period after that, we ask why does it seem to be taking sooo long?  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...
