"This video can not be played ""What about the 'alt-left',"" Trump asked US President Donald Trump has again blamed both sides for the violent unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left one protester dead and others injured. In a statement on Monday, he had condemned white supremacists. But in New York on Tuesday he also blamed left-wing supporters for charging at the ""alt-right"". His latest comments drew swift criticism, including from many in his Republican party. Many echoed Senator John McCain'sview,external: ""There is no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry"". Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise BBC reporter at the scene in Charlottesville The right-wing march had been organised to protest against the proposed removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee, who commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The event drew white supremacy groups. Violence broke out after they were confronted by anti-racism groups. A car ploughed into one group of anti-racism protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter On Monday, Donald Trump's condemnation of the far-right came from advisers counselling him on what was politically necessary to defuse the growing storm following the Charlottesville violence. On Tuesday, the president said what he really thought. Although he initially explained away the delay in condemnations of white supremacists as necessary for him to gather ""the facts"" of the situation, the nature of the protests were quite evident by the evening before, when demonstrators chanting white supremacist slogans held a torchlight parade through Charlottesville. In any regard, Mr Trump has shown little reluctance in jumping to conclusions about violent incidents when it appears Islamic extremism is at play. Upon further questioning, it became clear that the president views the Charlottesville unrest as far from a one-sided affair. Mixed in among the white supremacists, he said, were some good, peaceful people protesting the removal of a statue (of a man who led an army against the US government). And there were plenty of violent individuals among the counter-protesters as well. When the president on Saturday said there were ""many sides"" to blame, he meant it. If Donald Trump's initial handling of the fallout from Charlottesville started a political fire, on Tuesday the president poured on a bucket of kerosene and danced around the flames. Speakingat the White House on Monday, the US president had said that the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were ""repugnant"" to everything Americans held dear. But at a bad-tempered press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday, he reverted to blaming ""many sides"" for Saturday's violence. ""You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now,"" he said. ""What about the alt-left that came charging... at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? (...) There are two sides to a story."" Trump fans Bannon speculation Lincoln Memorial defaced with profanity This video can not be played Nine statues have been removed since 2016 He called the driver of the car that ploughed into the anti-racism protesters a disgrace to himself and his country, but said that those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". He asked whether statues of former presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson should also be torn down, because they had been slave-owners. This video can not be played Photojournalist Ryan M Kelly was covering the protest when the car ploughed into the crowd Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, whotweeted,external: ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."" This video can not be played Marissa Blair, friend of Heather Heyer: ""It was an act of terror"" But many others strongly condemned the comments.

In his address, Mr Trump defended the time it took to make his statement, saying he wanted to establish all the facts, and he again rounded on journalists at the news conference, saying many of them were writing ""fake news"". He also praised Ms Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, who had thanked him after his earlier statement for his ""words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred"".

"The pair were briefly reunited in 2008 on Capital Radio's breakfast show Denise van Outen has revealed the real reason she fell out with former Big Breakfast co-host Johnny Vaughan - pay. The pair were close but Denise told ITV's Loose Women show the friendship broke down when she found out he was renegotiating his contract separately. ""It was mainly to do with pay. The view was that I did other things outside of presenting... that I already had another side to my career."" She said the row was the reason that she left the Channel 4 show in 1999. Johnny has made no comment regarding Denise's explanation. ""At that particular time (the 90s), we were literally like brother and sister, we were best friends, unbreakable,"" Denise told the Loose Women panel. The pair also fronted shows on the BBC together ""The whole relationship fell apart when we started to renegotiate our contracts because I always felt that we worked together as a team and that is how it should be. ""I know there were other influences involved and agents and everything but he was negotiating his contract separately from me, which I found out,"" she said. She added that the friendship then felt ""tarnished"", which led her to leave the show. ""I knew at that point it would never be the same in that working environment."" At its peak, The Big Breakfast attracted two million viewers per episode. Van Outen said: ""Obviously I gave it a second go but a similar thing happened again (she returned for a short time in an ill-fated attempt to boost flagging ratings). It's hard because I loved him so much and I still do. ""I could still be angry about it now, but I have seen him since and, whenever I see him, because I love him so much and he makes me laugh so much, more than anyone I've ever met, I just forget about it. ""We were really, really good friends, I just don't know if it would ever be the same again."" Vaughan now presents the drivetime show on Radio X.

"Agatha Carter is in the Â£5k commuter club - and her husband Alistair almost is Rail fares are set to rise next year, meaning more of us are joining the so-called Â£5k commuter club - workers who pay that sum getting to and from work each year. So who are its members and where do they live? Season tickets to London are already above Â£5,000 from places such as Milton Keynes (Â£5,028 to London) and Portsmouth and Southsea in Hampshire (Â£5,048). When fares increase in January 2018, London commuters in Oxford, Colchester in Essex and Hastings in East Sussex are also set to join the club. Alistair Carter, from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, avoids the Â£5k commuter club - but only because he cycles the final leg to his Mayfair office. His wife Agatha is already a member - she pays Â£5,092 every year, including Tube travel. ""I have said to my boss that when my fare hits Â£5,000 I will be looking for a new job,"" says Alistair, a recruiter, whose ticket to London currently costs Â£4,094 a year. To compound matters, he says their 45-minute journey is normally delayed by 10 to 15 minutes. ""There is only one line in and one line out - whenever there's a problem with a train the whole line grinds to a halt,"" he says. Rail fares face biggest rise for five years Train fares: Why are they still going up? The couple moved out of London in 2013 to buy a bigger house, but are now considering staying in hotels a few days a week instead of buying a season ticket. ""We went to an Adele concert recently and stayed in a hotel for Â£42,"" he says. ""I said to my wife it would be cheaper to stay in London."" Train operators in England and Wales are expected to hike season ticket fares by up to 3.6% from January 2018. Therises are pegged to inflationfigures from July, but we will not know the exact price rises until later this year. Oxford to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,920 (+3.6% = Â£5,097) Colchester to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,928 (+3.6% = Â£5,105) Crowhurst, East Sussex to London St Pancras NOW: Â£4,952 (+3.6% = Â£5,130) Chichester to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,836 (+3.6% = Â£5,010) Based on annual National Rail season ticket to London Terminals The Â£5k club's growth is in part due to people travelling further and longer to get to work. Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more - but this has increased to 3.7 million today, according to the Office for National Statistics. In the club is Matt Blackwell, a sub-editor from Leicester, who combines a 70-minute train journey and two-mile cycle to get to his office in London. He says next year's fare increase is ""not an ideal situation"" as he already pays Â£9,000 a year. In the club: Matt Blackwell, who lives in Leicester with partner Niki Matt, 27, says: ""My partner is a teacher and works in Leicester. I work in the media, which is largely London-based. ""I lose a crippling Â£750 from my salary each month in repayments to my company, which covered the upfront cost of my ticket."" He adds: ""Even if the increase is minor come next January - when my season ticket runs out - I'm really not sure that I can afford to accommodate it, especially when I am far from guaranteed a rise in my salary."" But in the darkness, there is a chink of light - because the price rise takes effect from 1 January, commuters who buy an annual season ticket before 31 December pay this year's price.

"This video can not be played The moment parts of a tree fell on a crowd was caught on camera during a Facebook live A falling tree has killed at least 13 people and injured 49 at a religious ceremony on the Portuguese island of Madeira. A video shows the tree crashing down on a crowded square in a suburb of the main town, Funchal, spreading panic among people enjoying the festivities. Two children are reported to have been killed, and some of the injured are said to be foreign nationals. Reports suggest the tree which fell was an oak that was about 200 years old. As the island declared three days of mourning, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa arrived in a display of solidarity, telling reporters that ""all Portuguese people"" shared their shock. He was due to visit the scene of the disaster as well as a hospital and a civil defence facility. Madeira, a popular destination for European tourists, is the largest of a group of Portuguese islands in the north Atlantic Ocean, south-west of the Portuguese mainland. People had gathered outside a church in a village in the hills overlooking the town to celebrate the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption, which takes place on Tuesday and is a public holiday. The Lady of the Mount festival is the island's biggest. The square where the religious ceremony was taking place is surrounded by trees The tree came down just after midday (11:00 GMT) on Fountain Square, which has a Catholic shrine and other monuments, and is shaded by plane trees,according to the Funchal town website,external. ""I heard a great noise and when I looked at the tree it was already falling but was too fast and people started to run and those who couldn't run stayed under the tree,"" one unnamed eyewitness said. ""It was something we will never forget,"" said another. ""It sounded like shots and it just gave us time to look and run away when we realised there were people under the tree."" The president is due to visit the site where the tree fell later on Tuesday Emergency services flooded the area after the disaster, tending to the injured. Pedro Ramos, health secretary of the local government of Madeira, said the injured included German, Hungarian and French citizens, the Portuguese news site Publico reports. Witnesses quoted by Portuguese broadcaster RTP say the tree that fell had been shored up for at least two years because the trunk was hollow. People lit candles after the disaster President de Sousa said it was not for him to give an opinion on responsibility for the disaster as that was a ""matter for the regional authorities"". ""The president of the republic is conveying the clear, total and unconditional solidarity of the Portuguese,"" he said. This year's festival would have been all the more special because, Portuguese news site Publico notes, last year's event had to be cancelled due to forest fires. Danny Savage, BBC News High above Funchal, looking out across the Atlantic, is the village of Monte. Last night, the Catholic church, which attracts thousands of tourists, stood out like a beacon above the town, floodlit for the Feast of the Assumption. The cable car linking the town and the church worked late into the night taking thousands of people to and from the festivities. When we visited last week, parishioners were decorating the church altar in beautiful flowers. Friendly, cheerful, trying to make this year's festival special after wild fires destroyed the surrounding countryside last year leading the event to be cancelled. Today, thousands of people had gathered around the church again for a procession. A small square, close to where buses drop visitors, was busy when the tree came down. The crowd would have been mainly Portuguese but there are thousands of people from many other countries here at the moment, some of whom may have been caught up in this disaster.

"The amount of time spent needing daily care in late life has doubled in England over the past two decades, a study suggests. The Newcastle University study found men spent 2.4 years on average needing regular care and women three years. This includes everything from help with washing and dressing each day to round-the-clock care. Researchers said it suggested there needed to be a sharp increase in the number of care home places to cope. It comes as ministers consider a new way to fund the system. The government has promised major reform amid reports that councils are struggling to provide enough support to cope with the ageing population. Who gets social care and who pays for it? 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care How can social care be funded? The latest research, published in the Lancet, looked at not just the growth in the numbers of older people but also how many of those years were spent needing daily care. Between 1991 and 2011, life expectancy increased by more than four years for both men and women to 82.6 and 85.6 respectively. But the number of those years spent with substantial care needs rose much more rapidly, from 1.1 to 2.4 for men and 1.6 to three for women. Looking ahead to 2025, it means there will be another 350,000 people with high care needs, the researchers predicted. Not all of those will need to be in care homes, but the researchers said the number of places would still need to rise by a third to cope. Sir Andrew Dilnot, from Oxford University, who has advised the government on social care, said the findings suggested spending on older people would need to ""increase substantially and quickly"". Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, added: ""This report is further evidence, if it were needed, that the government must act urgently to put in place a sustainable social care system that is able to meet the demands of an ageing population.""

"""We'll see"" - with two words President Donald Trump has shovelled grist into Washington DC's rumour mill, which is filled with chatter that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is a marked man. The so-called Trump whisperer has proved himself one of the administration's great survivors - so far. Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist, is Death warmed up. By that I mean the characterisation of him by the US comedy circuit - literally as ""Death"" - is in stark contrast to the persona he projects when you meet him privately. He's full of surprises, and he has an infectious laugh. I've spoken with him on a number of occasions over the past few months. We've chatted about Nigel Farage, who led the Brexit campaign in the UK, and a variety of other topics: he doesn't drink, as I learned. He likes English tea (""a cuppa,"" he says). Still, he has a wicked reputation - and has frequently been cast as a malevolent force in the West Wing by those outside of the administration and by insiders, too. The anti-Bannon contingent includes Rupert Murdoch, the Fox News founder who's repeatedly lobbied the president,according to the New York Times,external, for the strategist to be sacked. At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, President Trump was asked whether he had confidence in Mr Bannon. And his tepid answer can't have been very reassuring to the White House chief strategist. ""I like him,"" said the president. ""He's a good man, he's not a racist, I can tell you that. ""He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. ""But we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon."" Other White House officials are watching as closely as everyone else. One of the president's aides has previously told me in a despairing tone that Mr Bannon supported the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". The aide looked at me as if to say: how do you work with someone like that? Mr Bannon pushed hard for the dismantling of the system and the trashing of the elites. He argued that this unconventional approach was the best way to improve economic conditions and employment prospects for ordinary working people in the US, the voters who helped propel Mr Trump into the White House. Mr Bannon sees the world in stark terms. He has been a strong proponent of the America First agenda, along with stricter border and immigration policies. The power structure at the White House has been constantly changing, but Mr Bannon was a key player in the administration from the beginning and has influenced the president on these policies in a significant manner. White House TVs drown out shouting Decoding the Trump 'war room' photograph Who is Donald Trump's chief strategist? Mr Bannon has apparently been at odds with so-called moderates in the administration, a group that includes the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, and Gary Cohn, the director of the national economic council, both of whom want to take a more measured approach to changing the government. In contrast, Mr Bannon has pushed for upheaval. He kept a whiteboard in his West Wing office, coveredin scribbled-out goals,externalsuch as ""Suspend immigration from terror prone regions"". He was known for the way that he trashed the press,telling reporters they had been ""humiliated"",externalby the Democratic defeat in the autumn, and he encouraged the president to demonise the media. He's also been accused of encouraging or at least tolerating racist, nationalist views among those who make up the president's base of support. Mr Bannon's ideological leanings are nothing new. He supported radical political reform while he was the head of Breitbart News,a website he described as,externala ""platform for the alt-right"", a movement that included the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalist groups. He pushed for the same agenda while he was working on Mr Trump's presidential campaign. Mr Bannon has millions of admirers, people who see the world in the way he does and also want to wreak havoc on the Washington establishment. One of the most important ones is Rebekah Mercer. The daughter of a New York investor, Robert Mercer, she has known Mr Bannon for years and helped to fund his enterprises. Robert Mercer, as the New Yorker's Jane Mayerhas documented,external, is an enigmatic libertarian and a key force behind Mr Trump's victory. Mr Bannon revelled in the populist uprising of Mr Trump and continued to stir things up after he won. At a rally for the president in Melbourne, Florida, in February, Mr Bannon looked on the crowd with a smile. He is polite (he's from the South) and charismatic, and White House aides have invariably tended to gravitate towards him. Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, used to bound up to Mr Bannon in a crowd, as if he were afraid he might miss something. A bear of a man, Mr Bannon looked rumpled when he travelled with the president, and he'd often smooth down his hair with his hand, trying to make himself more presentable. Still his hair always looked messy. Once we were supposed to meet in the West Wing at night. It was after 10pm on a Friday, and I waited outside the building. The place was quiet, and the lights from the building cast strange shadows on the ground.  As it turned out, he worked late into the night (""still grinding,"" he texted me) and then, House-of-Cards style, disappeared into the darkness. It's not clear whether Mr Bannon will ever be sacked. It's also not certain what the impact of his departure would be on the administration. He could marshal the dark forces of the internet and his Breitbart audience, swinging a wrecking ball at the Trump presidency. Some analysts believe the president will keep Mr Bannon at the White House because he's afraid that he'd do too much damage if he were thrown out. But there are other possibilities: if he left the White House on good terms, Mr Bannon could go back to Breitbart and push for policy changes in the administration from a strong position in the conservative media. Or he could simply disappear into the night, as I've seen him do in the past.

"Ian Brooke (centre) will share his Â£1m win with friends Rashad Own (L) and Andrew Enefer The landlord has become the third person at a pub in Lincolnshire to win Â£1m on the National Lottery. Ian Brooke, 43, who runs the Mallard in Scunthorpe, picked up the prize in the EuroMillions draw on 28 July. In 2015, two of his regular customers David and Kathleen Longbecame the first people to wina EuroMillions prize of Â£1m twice, following their first win in 2013. Mr Brooke said he planned to share his winnings with two of his friends. More on this and other North Lincolnshire stories ""After discovering I had won Â£1m I immediately went down to the pub where my friends were drinking and took them into a back room,"" said Mr Brooke. ""We always had a gentleman's agreement if one of us won we would share the prize."" Mr Brooke, who has worked behind the bar on Burringham Road for more than 18 years, said he planned to spend his Millionaire Maker raffle winnings on a holiday home in Benidorm, Spain, as well as a new car for each of his four children. The chances of winning the Millionaire Maker raffle on a Friday are about one in 2,950,000, according to lottery operator Camelot. This is based on ""anticipated ticket sales"" meaning the fewer people that enter, the better the odds of winning. These are far better odds than for the much bigger Euromillions jackpot, which has an average prize of Â£38.7m and odds of one in 139,838,160. When David and Kathleen Long won the Euromillions Â£1 million prize for a second time, Camelot said the odds were 283 billion to one but did not explain how it had arrived at the figure. The chances of winning the raffle at all, let alone being another winner at the same pub as the Longs, are very slim. People are more likely to bekilled by lightningthan to win the lottery once, let alone twice.

"The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks The government has said there must be an ""unprecedented solution"" for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. Apaper detailing its proposals,externalfocuses on the need to avoid a hard border. The government stresses there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border,which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as ""a fantasy frontier"". The government's paper does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it. Reaction to UK's Brexit paper on Ireland Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Analysis: No cross-border tariffs for small firms Reality Check: Ireland's border and Brexit Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit. This video can not be played Farming on the border The future management of that border is a highly sensitive issue and is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland Office officials say 80% of firms in Northern Ireland are small or medium sized and engaged in local business rather than international trade. If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade. Such firms might be required to declare their import and export businesses online. This video can not be played Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire insists to Today the proposals are realistic The government has repeated its desire to maintain the Common Travel Area and the rights of UK and Irish citizens, and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, of which the UK is a co-guarantor. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland. ""No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland, or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,""  she said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he broadly agreed with the position paper's ""aspirational"" principles. ""They reflect a lot of the language that the Irish government has been using, actually, in terms of maintaining the status quo, frictionless borders,"" he said. Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels Reporter The European Commission responded to the publication of the UK paper by saying there had to be a political deal to protect the Good Friday Agreement before a discussion could begin on technical measures. The paper is full of language and examples designed to soothe the EU about its worries. Michel Barnier said the Good Friday Agreement must be guaranteed. The UK said it would be. The Common Travel Area, which allows free movement between the UK and Ireland, is enshrined in an EU Treaty and letting it continue wouldn't be illegal under European Law. One British official said privately that if no agreement is reached, EU rules would compel the Irish government to introduce the hard border it does not want. Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Stephen Pound, said an ID card system would have to be introduced to manage immigration after Brexit. ""The idea of having a CGI, virtual reality border is nonsense, it's just a pipe dream but the second thing is it's about goods, it's not about people,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had discussed the issue at length with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier during a meeting in Brussels, in which he said there must be no hard border. ""I hope there can now be negotiations to make sure there is a continuation of absolute free movement between the Republic and Northern Ireland,"" he said. Critics argue the re-introduction of the hard border would severely damage the Northern Ireland peace process and have a negative economic impact. A European Commission spokeswoman said: ""We must discuss how to maintain the Common Travel Area and protect, in all of its dimensions, the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions."" The position paper forms part of the government's negotiations with the European Union, ahead of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. As revealed on Tuesday, Brexit SecretaryDavid Davis wants a limited transition periodto implement any new customs arrangements, including considerations relating to the ""unique circumstances"" of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The government ruled out suggestions of concentrating border checks at Irish Sea crossings Both the UK and Irish governments have repeatedly stated their opposition to a hard border, but the situation is complicated as the UK intends to leave the EU's customs union. The position paper sets out two ""broad approaches"" to future customs arrangements that the UK hopes will help to prevent physical customs posts along the Irish border. The suggestions are a ""new customs partnership"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". The partnership model would ""align"" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in ""no customs border at allbetween the UK and Ireland,"" the paper claims. This video can not be played One road crosses the border four times in 10 minutes, but can you spot where the crossings are? The paper suggests the second, ""highly-streamlined"" arrangement could include: A continued waiver on submitting entry/exit declarations Continued membership of the Common Transit Convention to help Northern Ireland and Irish companies transit goods A new ""trusted trader"" arrangement for larger businesses A ""cross-border trade exemption"" which would mean no new customs processes at all for smaller traders The paper also dismisses the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea, saying it would be economically and constitutionally unviable. It recognises that all this needs to be negotiated with the EU, in the hope that the border between the EU and the UK will be as ""seamless"" as possible. The government has repeatedly said it does not want to go back to the borders of the past Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not accept that the EU would be unwilling to facilitate the government's proposals. ""If you look at what [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier has said... there is a recognition that there will need to be specific arrangements in relation to customs and other elements in terms of creating that frictionless border,"" he said.

""It is clear the government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,"" said Mrs Foster, NI's former first minister. However, Sinn FÃ©in northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was ""a fleeting concern for the British government, we are collateral damage"". ""What we need to see is the Irish government acting in the national interest and defending the rights of those people here in the north that voted to stay with the European Union,"" she said. Earlier this year, residents from border communities held a protest at Stormont Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said the government seemed to be ""effectively playing for more time"". Countries in the customs union do not impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries.

"Students starting in September will face Â£5,800 in interest charges before they graduate, says the IFS The government is not shifting on plans to increase interest charges on student loans in England - which will rise to up to 6.1% from the autumn term. There had been speculation about a rethink over interest charges because of fears of excessive levels of debt. But on Tuesday the Department for Education and the Student Loans Company confirmed the proposed increase. The Department for Education said ""borrowers will only ever pay back what they can afford"". Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said young people faced a government which saw ""education as something to be sold and their aspirations as something to be taxed"". The announcement rules out suggestions that the government was considering limiting interest rate increases for student loans on tuition fees and maintenance costs from September 2017 to August 2018. But there has so far been no announcement on whether the government will push ahead with another increase in tuition fees for 2018, which would put fees over Â£9,500 per year. Hundreds of thousands of young people will hear about their A-level results and university places this week - and those taking up courses this autumn will be charged 6.1% on loans as soon as they arrive. Jo Johnson says record numbers of poorer students are now getting university places With fees increasing to Â£9,250, theInstitute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that students will have accumulated Â£5,800 in interest charges before they have even graduated. The increase from 4.6% to 6.1% in interest charges will also apply to other former students who have studied since fees were increased to Â£9,000 in 2012. The interest rate is based on the inflation rate, using the retail prices index in March, plus an additional 3%. During the general election, Labour campaigned for scrapping tuition fees - and in the wake of the election there was renewed debate about whether tuition fees and interest charges were unacceptably high. Former Labour education minister Lord Adonis has calledthe level of interest charges ""indefensible"", and the head of the Russell Group of universities has called for a reassessment of interest rates. The amount of debt owed by students this year went past the Â£100bn level, having more than doubled in six years. Labour's Angela Rayner accused the government of ""sneaking these changes through without allowing MPs to vote on them"". ""Graduate debt is already skyrocketing, and too many students fear a lifetime of debt,"" she said. Universities Minister Jo Johnson has argued that the fee system represents a fair distribution of costs between students and taxpayers and that this provides financial sustainability for universities. He says that this has allowed a record number of students from poorer backgrounds to enter university. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""As has always been the case, borrowers will only ever pay back what they can afford so no-one will see monthly repayments rise and only the highest earners will pay the top rate of interest."" The department says that the loans give ""protections other lenders don't offer"", such as not requiring repayments if income falls below a threshold of Â£21,000 and that any unpaid debts are paid off after 30 years.

"The bells will still sound to mark New Year celebrations Parliament has defended silencing the chimes of Big Ben for four years to protect workers' hearing during restoration works. Cabinet minister David Davis described the move as ""mad"" and newspapers also criticised the decision. But a UK Parliament spokesman said that ""prolonged exposure to the chimes would pose a serious risk to the hearing"" of those working on the project. The TUC said silencing the chimes was ""common sense"". How do you take a good photo of Big Ben? The bongs will sound for the final time at 12:00 BST on Monday 21 Augustbefore being disconnected to allow the clock and surrounding tower to be restored - a project that is expected to last until 2021. The UK Parliament spokesman said the Palace of Westminster had ""a duty of care to those on site"". Earlier, Brexit Secretary Mr Davis had said there was ""hardly a health and safety argument"" for silencing the bells. ""I think it's mad,"" he told LBC radio. ""I'd forgotten of course, I've been out of government for a lot of years, and I've forgotten how long it takes to get the approvals for this and the approvals for that. ""There's a sort of rude phrase which I will shorten to 'just get on with it'. ""When I was in business, it was my standard line, just get on, just do it, don't faff."" The Telegraph reported on a ""backlash"" from other MPs and columnist Frances Wilson wrote: ""Silencing Big Ben is like stopping the heartbeat of our democracy."" The Daily Mail said that where the Luftwaffe failed during World War Two, ""health and safety is about to succeed"" An article in the Daily Mail said: ""Not even Nazi bombs could silence the famous symbol of Britishness. ""But having marked the hour with almost unbroken service since 1859, the Great Bell's bongs will soon cease for four years - because of health and safety."" TUC health and safety officer Hugh Robertson said: ""Protecting workers' hearing is far from 'health and safety gone mad.'"" He added: ""When all 14 tonnes of Big Ben bongs near you, you'll know it. ""At nearly 120 decibels, it's like putting your ear next to a police siren."" Alongside conservation work to the Elizabeth Tower which houses the Great Bell, the Great Clock will be dismantled piece-by-piece and its four dials will be cleaned and repaired. A spokesman for Parliament said: ""Constant proximity and prolonged exposure to the chimes would pose a serious risk to the hearing of those working on the scaffolding or in the Tower. ""Whilst hearing protection provides a suitable short term solution to the 118 decibel chiming and striking of the bells, it is not acceptable for those working for long periods in the vicinity of Big Ben. ""In addition, it is vital for workers to be able to communicate with one another on site, or to raise an alarm should the necessity arise. This would not be possible were the bells to continue to sound throughout the works. ""Workers on the scaffolding could also be startled by the loud sudden noise, with consequences for their own safety and those of other people in and around the tower.

"The government says it will propose an ""innovative and untested approach"" to customs checks as part of its Brexit negotiations. The model, one of two being put forwardin a newly-published paper,external, would mean no customs checks at UK-EU borders. The UK's alternative proposal - a more efficient system of border checks - would involve ""an increase in administration"", it admits. A key EU figure said the idea of ""invisible borders"" was a ""fantasy"". On Twitter, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's negotiator, added that other issues had to be agreed before negotiations on trade could begin - views echoed by the EU's overall chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Government to unveil Irish border plan Analysis: Is UK leaving the customs union? Customs union, free trade area and single market - an explainer The UK has already said it will leave the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - after Brexit, and businesses have been calling for clarity on what the replacement system will involve. The UK's proposals, detailed in what it calls a ""future partnership paper"", also include the possibility of a ""temporary customs union"" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business as they adapt to the new arrangements. Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Farmers back temporary customs union According to the new paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a ""temporary customs union"" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member. Ministers said the use of interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements. Once this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a ""highly streamlined"" border with the EU, or a new ""partnership"" with no customs border at all. Reality Check: The UK's customs union proposals The ""partnership"" arrangement would be an ""innovative and untested approach"" which would remove the need for any customs checks between the UK and the EU. This would be because the UK's regime would ""align precisely"" with the EU's, for goods that will be consumed in the EU. However, the UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and the government said safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. These could include a repayment mechanism, which would see importers to the UK pay whichever is the higher tariff, Britain's or the EU's, and then face having to claim money back if their goods were sold to a customer in the region with a lower tariff. Brexit Secretary David Davis (left) and the EU Commission's Michel Barnier are leading the negotiations for the two sides An alternative scenario the government is proposing would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals - but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. It said it would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. The UK would also allow some traders to do self assessment, calculating their own customs duties. However, the government acknowledged this option would still involve ""an increase in administration"" compared with being in the existing customs union. All of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters. Other obstacles - including the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"" - need to be agreed first. The government will also set up its own ""standalone"" system in the event of no deal being reached, which would involve charging customs duty and VAT on imports from the EU, although it says it is keen to avoid this scenario. Previous estimates by HMRC have predicted a sudden increase in the number of customs declarations after Brexit - subject to any new arrangements agreed with the EU - from a maximum of 55 million to 255 million per year. Can technology offer frictionless borders? This video can not be played David Davis tells Today Brexit is going ""incredibly well"" David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said he envisioned the interim customs system being ""as close as we can to the current arrangements"", but with the UK able to negotiate and sign its own international trade deals. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he did not rule out the UK paying to be part of the arrangement, saying he was not going to conduct negotiations on air. And he said he did not believe the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of the temporary arrangement, adding that the government would publish proposals on ""international arbitration"" next week. Mr Davis said the transition period should be ""something like two years, maybe a bit shorter"" but that it had ""to be done by the election"", meaning 2022 at the latest. Analysis by the BBC's Eleanor Garnier Philip Hammond and Liam Fox were on opposite sides of last year's EU referendum debate These proposals are designed to demonstrate unity - after reported cabinet splits - and show the government has a plan in place. Chancellor Philip Hammond has got his way in seeking an interim customs arrangement as much like the status quo as possible. And Liam Fox could potentially win the right to negotiate international trade deals during the transition period. But this is about much more than domestic political battles - it's about whether the UK can succeed in getting Brussels negotiators to talk about trade at the same time as the so-called divorce arrangements, something they have steadfastly refused to do so far. The EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted that customs could not be discussed until the Irish border, citizens' rights and the UK's separation payment had been settled. A European Commission spokesman added: ""As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union."" Allow Twitter content?

Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were ""incoherent and inadequate"" and were designed to ""gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet"". But his party also faced questions on its position. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 live, shadow international trade minister Bill Esterson would not say whether Labour would remain in the customs union after March 2019. Asked repeatedly, he said Labour would seek ""the same relationship that we have now"". ""The detail of whether it's defined as being membership or not isn't the point,"" he added.

Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the UK of a ""daft have cake and eat it"" approach. Pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry said ministers were ""moving in the right direction"" with their proposals for an interim arrangement. But she said they should admit that ""no new agreement with the EU can fully replace the benefits of customs union membership"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable accused ministers of ""kicking the can down the road"" and argued for staying in the customs union. But the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was ""encouraging"". Its deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: ""The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible."" Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said most businesses were more concerned about future customs arrangements with the EU than future trade deals.

""There's no doubt that during this transitional period, the free movement of people will continue, the European Court of Justice will go on having judgements over British business and, of course, we'll go on paying a membership fee.

"There are two competing visions of how goods will flow in and out of the UK after Brexit. Either the M20 will become a lorry park as endless customs checks at Dover choke the motorway. Or technology will help create frictionless borders and exporters will hardly notice any change. The truth, according to those who have studied the issue, is somewhere between the two. So, can technology solve the border puzzle? Right now there are no customs checks at Dover or other borders with EU countries. After Brexit there will be - unless the idea floated by the UK of an invisible border gets a better reception in Europe than it has today. Whatever the nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU after we leave, it seems certain that there will be added bureaucracy for both companies and the government, but technology should lighten the load. Even if there are no tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, companies will probably have to show where their goods have originated, otherwise this country could be used to get something like New Zealand lamb onto the continent without any limits. Not necessarily - they can be conducted at factories before the goods depart, and much of the paperwork will in fact be digital, carried out online. If the UK sticks with the EU's safety and quality standards, there will have to be checks to make sure goods match up to those benchmarks and that doesn't have to be done at a port or border. But it will all depend on improved IT systems. Yes, but they are fairly old. Brexit Secretary David Davis says a new system will be in place by early 2019. It appears he is referring to the upgrade of HMRC's customs processing system, Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (Chief), which is more than 20 years old and was due to be replaced even before the Brexit vote. The new system is called CDS - Customs Declaration Service - and is being developed in part by IBM. HMRC admits that it may now have to accommodate five times as many customs declarations as originally envisaged, but says it's confident that it will be ready in time. Not quite. Last month the National Audit Office said HMRC faced ""some significant challenges to deliver the programme within the current timetable"" and gave it an amber risk rating. But even if the system is up and running with all exporters on board, that won't be enough to create a frictionless border. Ports like Dover will need to install new technology, including number plate recognition, to match the lorries driving on and off ferries with the customs declarations lodged in the CDS system. This is not cutting edge technology and is in use elsewhere in the world, but HMRC seems dubious that it will be in place by March 2019 and says it would benefit from an implementation period. More exporters will also be pressed to become AEOs - Authorised Economic Operators -  taking advantage of an existing system which many large companies use to speed up the customs process. Other solutions being floated include using the blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrencies to make the sharing of data about exports much simpler, and employing artificial intelligence to decide where random checks on shipments crossing the borders should be targeted. But with the deadline for getting back control of the UK's borders just 18 months away, such innovative technology ideas are not priorities for the civil servants entrusted with this task. In fact, making sure there are no traffic jams in Dover will be more about the arts of management, politics and the law than technology.

"Prince Sultan bin Turki, pictured centre Between 2015 and 2017, three Saudi princes living in Europe disappeared. All were critical of the Saudi government - and there is evidence that all were abducted and flown back to Saudi Arabiaâ¦ where nothing further has been heard from them. Early in the morning on 12 June 2003, a Saudi prince is being driven to a palace on the outskirts of Geneva. His name is Sultan bin Turki bin Abdulaziz, and the palace belongs to his uncle, the late King Fahd. It's the king's favourite son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, who has invited him to breakfast. Abdulaziz asks Sultan to return to Saudi Arabia - where he says a conflict over Sultan's criticisms of the Saudi leadership will be resolved. Sultan refuses, at which point Abdulaziz excuses himself to make a phone call. The other man in the room, the Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs, Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh, leaves too and after a few moments masked men rush in. They beat Sultan and handcuff him, then a needle is plunged into his neck. Unconscious, Sultan is rushed to Geneva airport - and carried on to a Medevac plane that is conveniently waiting on the tarmac. Such, at least, is Sultan's account of the events, as told to a Swiss court many years later. Among Sultan's staff, waiting at a Geneva hotel for him to return from his breakfast appointment, was his communications officer, Eddie Ferreira. ""Progressively, as the day went on the silence became deafening,"" he remembers. ""We couldn't reach the security team. That was the first real alert. We tried to contact the prince; there was no response, no answer."" Then, in the afternoon, two unexpected visitors arrived. ""The Saudi ambassador to Switzerland came in with the general manager of the hotel and quite simply just told everybody to vacate the penthouse and get out,"" Ferreira says. ""The prince was in Riyadh, our services were no longer required, and we could leave."" What had Prince Sultan done that could have led his family to violently drug and kidnap him? The previous year he had arrived in Europe for medical treatment, and started giving interviews critical of the Saudi government. He condemned the country's record on human rights, complained about corruption among princes and officials, and called for a series of reforms. Ever since 1932, when King Abdulaziz, known as Ibn Saud, founded Saudi Arabia, the country has been ruled as an absolute monarchy. It does not tolerate dissent. Prince Turki bin Bandar meets Pakistan's finance minister in 2003 Prince Turki bin Bandar was once a major in the Saudi police, with responsibility for policing the royal family itself. But a bitter family dispute over a contested inheritance landed him in prison, and on his release he fled to Paris, where, in 2012, he began posting videos on YouTube calling for reform in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis reacted as they had with Prince Sultan, and tried to persuade Turki to return. When Ahmed al-Salem, the deputy minister of the interior called, the prince recorded the conversation and posted it online. ""Everybody's looking forward to your return, God bless you,"" says the deputy minister. ""Looking forward to my return?"" replies Turki. ""What about the letters your officers send me? 'You son of a whore, we'll drag you back like Sultan bin Turki.'"" The deputy minister replies reassuringly: ""They won't touch you. I'm your brother."" ""No they're from you,"" says Turki. ""The Ministry of Interior sends them."" Turki went on publishing videos until July 2015. Then, sometime later that year, he disappeared. ""He called me every month or two,"" says a friend, the blogger and activist Wael al-Khalaf. ""Then he disappeared for four or five months. I was suspicious. [Then] I heard from a senior officer in the kingdom that Turki bin Bandar was with them. So they'd taken him, he'd been kidnapped."" After a long search for news of Turki, I found an article in a Moroccan newspaper, which said that he had been about to return to France after a visit to Morocco, when he was arrested and jailed. Then, following a request from the Saudi authorities, he was deported with the approval of a Moroccan court. We don't know for certain what happened  to Turki bin Bandar, but before he disappeared he gave his friend Wael a copy of a book he'd written, in which he had added what may be a prophetic note. ""Dear Wael, these statements are not to be shared unless I am kidnapped or assassinated. I know I will be kidnapped or they will assassinate me. I also know how they abuse my rights and those of the Saudi people."" Saud bin Saif al-Nasr Around the same time as Prince Turki vanished another Saudi prince, Saud bin Saif al-Nasr - a relatively minor royal with a liking for Europe's casinos and expensive hotels - shared a similar fate. In 2014 Saud began writing tweets that were critical of the Saudi monarchy. He called for the prosecution of Saudi officials who'd backed the overthrow of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi the previous year. Then, in September 2015, Saud went further. After an anonymous Saudi prince wrote two letters calling for a coup to remove King Salman, Saud publicly endorsed them - the only royal to do so. This was tantamount to treason, and may have sealed his fate. A few days later, he tweeted: ""I call for the nation to turn the content of these letters into popular pressure."" Then his Twitter account went silent. Another dissident prince - Prince Khaled bin Farhan, who fled to Germany in 2013 - believes Saud was tricked into flying from Milan to Rome to discuss a business deal with a Russian-Italian company seeking to open branches in the Gulf. ""A private plane from the company came and took Prince Saud. But it didn't land in Rome, it landed in Riyadh,"" Khaled says. ""It turned out Saudi intelligence had fabricated the entire operation,"" he claims. ""Now Prince Saud's fate is the same as Prince Turki's, which is prisonâ¦ The only fate is an underground prison."" Kidnapped: Saudi Arabia's Missing Princeswill be broadcast on BBC Arabic on Tuesday 15 August at 19:05 GMT and repeated on 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 August The film was also broadcast on BBC Newsnight on Monday 14 August.Watch it here Prince Sultan, being higher up the royal pecking order, was shuttled between prison and house arrest. But his health was also deteriorating, so in 2010 the royal family allowed him to seek medical treatment in Boston, Massachusetts. What he did from the safety of his US exile must have horrified the Saudis - he filed a criminal complaint in the Swiss courts, accusing Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd and Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh of responsibility for his 2003 kidnap. His American lawyer, Clyde Bergstresser, obtained a medical record from King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, where Sultan was admitted on 13 June 2003, which indicated that a tube had been placed into his mouth to help him breathe while anaesthetised, and that one side of his diaphragm was paralysed - presumably as a result of the assault. For the first time a senior Saudi royal was launching a criminal complaint, in a Western court, against another family member. But Bergstresser says the Swiss authorities have shown little interest in the case. ""Nothing has been done to pursue what occurred at the airport,"" he says. ""Who were the pilots? What were the flight plans when these planes from Saudi Arabia arrived? This abduction occurred on Swiss soil and one would think that there would be an interest in finding out how that occurred."" In January 2016, Sultan was staying at an exclusive Paris hotel when, like Saud bin Saif al-Nasr, he was tempted on to an aeroplane. He was planning to visit his father, also a well-known critic of the Saudi government, in Cairo, when the Saudi consulate offered him and his entourage of about 18 - including a personal doctor and nurses and bodyguards from the US and Europe - the use of a private jet. Despite what had happened to him in 2003, he accepted. Two members of the entourage explain how events unfolded. Both prefer to remain anonymous. ""We pulled on to the tarmac and in front of us was a huge airplane, with... it had the country of Saudi Arabia written on it,"" says one. ""It was a little eerie because there were a lot of crew members on board. All of them were male,"" says the other. The plane took off with in-flight monitors showing it was bound for Cairo. But two-and-a-half hours into the flight, the monitors went blank. Prince Sultan was sleeping in his room, but he woke up about an hour before landing. He looked out of the window, and appeared anxious, the former members of his staff say. As it dawned on the passengers that they were about to land in Saudi Arabia, Sultan started banging on the cockpit door and crying for help. A crew member ordered the prince's team to stay in their seats. ""We looked out the window and we just saw a bunch of people get out with their rifles slung over their chest and surrounded the plane,"" says one of the members of his entourage. The soldiers and cabin crew dragged Sultan from the plane. He was screaming at his team to call the US embassy. The prince and his medics were taken to a villa and put under armed guard. On the plane the others waited nervously. They were later taken to a hotel, held for three days without passports or telephones, then allowed to fly to a destination of their choice. Before they left, a Saudi official, who the prince's staff recognised as one of the ""flight attendants"" on the plane, offered an apology. ""He told us that we were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that he was sorry for the inconvenience,"" one of them says. The other adds: ""I wasn't inconvenienced - I was kidnapped. I was held against my will in a country that I did not choose to go to."" It was an astonishing situation. Together with Prince Sultan, about 18 foreign nationals had been kidnapped, taken to Saudi Arabia, and held by the Saudi military. There has been no news of Prince Sultan since these events. I asked the government of Saudi Arabia to respond to the allegations in this film. It declined to comment. Prince Khaled Meanwhile Prince Khaled, still exiled in Germany, worries that he too will be forced to return to Riyadh. ""There were four of us family members in Europe. We criticised the family and its rule in Saudi Arabia. Three of us were kidnapped. I'm the only one left,"" he says. Could he be next on the abduction list? ""I'm convinced. I've been convinced for a long time. If they could do it, they'd have done it by now. I'm very cautious, but it's at the price of my freedom."" Update, October 2018: Two months after this story was published the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Fasial, confirmed that all three missing princes were back in Saudi Arabia. Prince Khaled bin Farhan, meanwhile, says he has heard from sources inside the country that Prince Turki bin Bandar and Saud bin Saif al-Nasr have both been executed.

"Revellers inhale the gas from balloons - it can distort sound, create feelings of euphoria or trigger a headache Wholesalers in the Netherlands say that in the past two years there has been a 400% rise in sales of nitrous oxide, more commonly known as laughing gas. New companies selling the small bullet-shaped canisters are popping up online, but there are concerns about the risks in taking the increasingly popular legal high. The BBC's Anna Holligan investigates. The pungent scent of marijuana wafted through the summer air outside Rotterdam's reggae festival. The Netherlands is famous for its traditionally relaxed attitude towards soft drugs. ""I'm looking for laughing gas,"" I call out. ""I'll give you laughter for free,"" joked one dreadlocked man, rolling a joint. But this wasn't the place to find nitrous oxide. It's popular among clubbers and often used in combination with other drugs like MDMA (ecstasy) or ketamine. A user intoxicated by laughing gas It's a depressant-type drug, which slows down your brain and your body's responses. The effects include: Feelings of euphoria, relaxation and calmness Dizziness, difficulty in thinking straight and fits of giggles or laughter Sound distortions or even hallucinations In some people, a headache Source:Frank drugs advice,external How dangerous is laughing gas? The reggae crowd recommended ordering it online - or buying it in Blokker. Could the most popular Dutch hardware chain be supplying a legal high? I entered the store, passing ironing boards and packed lunch boxes. ""Excuse me, do you sell laughing gas canisters?"" Without hesitation, the middle-aged shop assistant turned around, reached inside a cupboard behind the counter, and handed over a small box containing 10 silver cartridges. Nitrous oxide is used in the catering industry to pump whipped cream. Women in labour are often offered it to take the edge off their contractions. Your dentist may have used it as an anaesthetic. But it's taking off as a relatively cheap and accessible drug of choice in the dance music scene. In the Netherlands, its use gained a boost when the government changed the law so it was no longer classed as a medicine. Retailers say they try to discourage this. When asked for comment, Blokker said it had taken measures including making it available only on request and limiting the number of packages it sold to each customer. Soft drugs such as marijuana and hashish are actually illegal in the Netherlands. Anyone found selling, producing, dealing or in possession of these drugs is liable to prosecution. However, the Netherlands applies a policy of tolerance in relation to the sale of soft drugs in coffee shops - so although it is considered a criminal offence, the Public Prosecution Service does not prosecute them. ""Legal highs"" are openly sold in Amsterdam. The Netherlands attracts tourists keen to take advantage of the country's liberal attitude to recreational drugs. The Dutch philosophy regarding soft drugs can be summed up as ""inform and educate rather than legislate"". Members of the public are not prosecuted for possessing small quantities of soft drugs. Source:Dutch government,external ""Ryan"" tells me he's a regular laughing gas user. ""I got my first balloon here in Holland last summer,"" he says. ""Nobody was taking it then. This year it's huge, huge. I'm seeing canisters lying around on the street."" Discarded canisters are a tell-tale sign of recreational nitrous oxide use The nitrous oxide canisters are usually inserted into aerosol dispensers. The gas is then blown into balloons and inhaled. Home delivery companies specialising in the ""party gas"" have registered with the chamber of commerce. And you don't need a licence to sell. Ryan's friends are making a fortune importing crates and selling it to tourists in Ibiza. Deaths linked to laughing gas are rare. Between 2008-15, 15 people died in the UK as a result of asphyxiation,says the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs,external, their brains being starved of oxygen. A number of the deaths involved enclosed spaces. Dutch drugs advisers warn that the drug can freeze your mouth and airways if taken directly from the aerosol spray, it can cause nausea and dizziness and increase the chance of a bad trip or panic attack if taken with other drugs. If you have a cold it can damage your eardrum and cause deafness, and repeated use can cause a vitamin B12 deficiency - which can lead to neurological disorders, warns Dutch Drugs Info. The prevailing wisdom in the Netherlands is that the most effective way to reduce drugs risk is to make sure people understand the effects of what they're taking. If the popularity of nitrous oxide continues to spread across Europe it could force countries to look into how and where this powerful substance is sold.

"Stunt performers have died while filming Deadpool 2 and The Walking Dead Two stunt performers have died during filming in North America in the past few weeks, but how dangerous a profession were they in and what regulations are there to protect people? A stuntwoman waskilled in a motorcycle accidentearlier this week while filming Deadpool 2 in the Canadian city of Vancouver. Eyewitnesses said Joi SJ Harris had lost control of the bike, jumped a kerb and crashed into a building. Her death follows that of stuntmanJohn Bernecker,who died after suffering a fall on the set of The Walking Dead. The accidents have prompted questions about the profession and what safeguards are in place to protect stunt performers in the film industry. In the UK, stunt co-ordinators and performers can apply to join the Joint Industry Stunt Committee (JISC) register. There are three levels of membership - probationary, intermediate and full. Each has various required competencies and it can take up to seven years to reach the top. Stunt co-ordinator and performer Tony Christian told the BBC: ""People on the register have chosen to do this as a career, as opposed to being someone who just wants to have a go at stunts or a daredevil."" To move up the levels, members have to prove they have taken on a variety of work in the industry so they can demonstrate the skills to perform in different situations. Before being listed in the register, however, applicants have to provide evidence of their stunt performance skills as well as their knowledge and application of health and safety rules. They need qualifications to the appropriate standard in six or more categories, with at least one in the Fighting group. Group A: Fighting (categories: martial arts and boxing) Group B: Falling (categories: trampolining and high diving) Group C: Riding and Driving (categories: horse riding, cars and motorcycles) Group D: Agility and Strength (categories: gymnastics and rock climbing) Group E: Water (categories: swimming and sub aqua) Source: Equity,external The register is the only authorised directory of stunt artists based in the UK and it is advisable for people to be members to be employed, although not a legal requirement. Christian said: ""Being on the register promotes good sense and although you don't have to be part of the register to be a performer, we always try and persuade productions to make the stunt register their first call when crewing stunts for a feature or television programme."" A spokesman for the British Action Academy (BAA) added: ""While the vast majority of successful stunt performers have trained and joined the stunt register, some performers have had successful careers specialising in certain stunt areas, such as stunt driving, without training for the stunt register. However, this is a much tougher route and can be very hard to gain contacts."" The recent accidents have brought the issue of safety to the fore once again. It is clearly impossible to guarantee 100% safety in any stunt work but many safeguards are in place. Stuntwoman dies on set of Deadpool 2 in Vancouver Stuntman hospitalised after Royal Welsh Show accident John Bernecker: Walking Dead stuntman dies in fall I ran away from my husband and became a stuntwoman The BAA spokesman told the BBC: ""Professional stunts on film and TV productions are invariably well planned and rehearsed and the crew's top priority in any stunt is safety - not only for the performer but for any spectators, cast and crew around the stunt. ""It's the stunt co-ordinator's job to ensure the stunt is risk assessed and with the help of his team and the crew, to ensure it is rehearsed as often as possible for the performer to feel safe and confident in their action."" By their very nature, stunts are dangerous but what safety measures are taken during scenes like car chases and fights? ""On a basic level, precautions can include using experienced stunt performers, specially adapted stunt cars, full padding and helmets for the drivers and road closures to protect the public,"" the BAA spokesman continued. ""When it comes to stunts involving knives and swords, these weapons should be props designed to look as real as possible so they will not be sharp. ""Sharp weapons should only be used for close-ups. If needed, stunt performers can wear padding to protect themselves."" He added: ""In most cases, the main elements of high-octane stunts are real. You will have real cars with stunt drivers chasing down real streets. ""Obviously, there are clever camera tricks to make it look like a car is travelling at 100 mph, where in reality it can be travelling much slower. Driving cages can be put on the top of cars, controlling the car from the roof by a stunt driver, to make it look like the actor in the car is driving. Driving cages - such as this one, used for BBC drama The Interceptor - allow the person on top to drive the car ""There are many effects with CGI that will enhance the scene but in most cases, these stunts are real."" Real they may be - but it is not always possible to successfully shoot a dangerous scene first time. Christian says: ""The risk increases the more you do it and you try to limit the number of takes that are done, but sometimes factors like the cameraman missing the shot, the lighting going amiss or the director not being happy with how the shot turned out can affect things. ""Occasionally you can have a one-take wonder, but usually at the most it would be done two or three times."" While most stunts are performed by the professionals, some actors prefer to do their own. However, they are in the minority as the BAA spokesman explains: ""There are many reasons why most actors don't perform their own stunts. One reason would be that action can be shot on a second unit and an actor may be needed at the same time on the main unit, so they can't be in two places at once! ""Another reason would be the safety of the actor. If a lead actor is injured in any way, this can become a costly issue for production and they will not want to put anyone's life in danger. Actors are much more physical these days and some do like to participate in certain stunts, if it's deemed safe to do so.""

"""My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard,"" Taylor Swift says US pop singer Taylor Swift has won a civil case against an ex-DJ who she said grabbed her bottom after putting his hand under her skirt during a pre-concert photo opportunity in 2013. The casehas grabbed headlinesfor the star's bold testimony in court, and emphasis that she wanted to fight the case not just for herself but for all women who are victimised. Here are four reasons why it's significant. The 2013 incident only became public in 2015 when radio personality David Mueller- who lost his job after Ms Swift's team reported the groping claim to his radio station - filed a defamation lawsuit against Ms Swift. With the incident out in the open, Ms Swift filed a countersuit alleging sexual assault  - which she has just won. In court, Taylor Swift's mother, Andrea Swift, said she did not go to police when her daughter first told her she had been groped because: ""I did not want this event to define her life."" ""I did not want her to have to live through the endless memes and gifs that tabloid media and internet trolls decided to come up with - doctoring the picturesâ¦ and making her relive this awful moment over and over again,"" she said. Ms Swift's lawyer said the star had wanted to keep the situation ""discreet and quiet and confidential"". Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court But by not reporting the alleged groping to authorities in the first place, the pop superstar was responding in the same way that thousands of American women do every year. This photo of Taylor Swift (centre) and David Mueller (right) was a key piece of evidence in court According to RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organisation in the United States, two out of three sexual assaults in the countrygo unreported,external. The top three reasons for people not doing so are fearing retaliation, not believing the police will help and considering it to be a ""personal matter"". Taylor Swift's reasons for not going to the police, as told by her mother, who is part of her management team, are revealing. The case highlights how some victims fear being ridiculed, not being believed or not being taken seriously after reporting an alleged sexual assault. The trial showed how some defence lawyers try to undermine the credibility of an alleged victim. But some of the most potent moments occurred when Taylor Swift refused to let that happen. At one point, rejecting an accusation that she had misidentified Mueller, she said: ""I'm not going to allow you or your client to say I am to blame."" When asked why a photo taken at the time of the alleged incident does not show the front of her skirt ruffled, she bluntly responded: ""Because my ass is located on the back of my body."" Press cameras were not allowed in court during the week-long trial At another moment, she said: ""I know exactly who did this. It is not alleged. It is a fact. ""You can ask me a million questions about it and I'm never going to say anything different."" Gutsy testimony praised Is this a good drawing of Taylor Swift? Her testimony drew praise, with Slate magazine's Christina Cauteruccidescribing it,externalas ""sharp, gutsy and satisfying"". ""For young fans of Swift's, hearing a beloved artist speak candidly about the emotional damage of sexual assault and stand up to a courtroom of men trying to prove her wrong could be a formative moment for their developing ideas of gender, sex, and accountability,"" she wrote. Taylor Swift only asked for a symbolic $1 (77p) in damages from Mr Mueller and has now pledged to donate to organisations that help defend sexual assault victims. ""I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this,"" she said in a statement following the verdict. ""My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard."" Dealing with groping in the office Her lawyer Douglas Baldridge  said she asked only for $1 because she did not want to bankrupt Mr Mueller, but rather use the case to send a message to all women that ""they will decide what will be tolerated with their body"". Ms Swift is being praised for inspiring other women to speak out about groping, even if they might not have the advantages she has in terms of wealth, fame and public support. Allow Twitter content?

Ten-year-old fan Vega Zaringlee, who attended the trial, told the New York Times that she wanted to thank Ms Swift for standing up for women. ""I now know what honest people talking about a situation that victimised them sound like,"" she said. We are used to seeing high-profile cases of alleged sexual assault of abuse involving celebrities, but they are often the accused, rather than the accuser. Of course Taylor Swift is far from the first female pop star to make such allegations. In fact, she gave $250,000 (Â£193,000) to the singer Kesha in 2016 to help her pay legal fees in cases against her former producer, whom she accused of sexual assault. Some brand strategists have suggested that with the civil case, Taylor Swift has been not only trying to empower ordinary women that she doesn't know, but also music industry colleagues. ""Taylor is aware that her defiance in fighting against these allegations - not only made toward her but other artists and colleagues - will achieve global visibility around sexual assault issues that, in many cases, go unreported and ignored and are marginalised,""PR strategist Marvet Britto told NBC News,external.

"Tosin Oke, 36, is the reigning African triple jump champion Nigeria failed to win a medal at this month's World Athletics Championships - meaning Africa's most populous nation has come home empty-handed from eight of the last nine tournaments. Some athletes, like Tosin Oke, feel the lack of medals reflects a lack of support from the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN). The triple jumper alleges discrimination and the holding back of training funds from the AFN. He also feels let down by the IAAF, after complaining to athletics' governing body about his concerns. Oke, 36, is the reigning African champion in triple jump. Having competed for Great Britain as a youngster - winning a European junior title - he switched to compete for his parents' homeland after not being selected for the 2007 World Championships. Since then, he has won three African titles: two gold medals at the All Africa Games (the ""African Olympics"") and another gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. At the 2012 Olympics, Oke was Nigeria's best performing individual athlete - finishing seventh in the final. Nonetheless, he says he has suffered repeated discrimination at the hands of Nigerian sports authorities, which he believes stems from his public criticisms of their work. After winning at the 2015 All Africa Games (AAG), Oke wrote to the director-general of the National Sports Commission, the body then responsible for overseeing sport in Nigeria. In his email to Alhassan Yakmut, the athlete outlined the funds he desired to support an attempt to go for a field medal at the 2016 Olympics - a feat which no Nigerian man has ever achieved. ""Well received. Sorry your refusal to take a lap of honour at the AAG has ruled you out of Rio. Yakmut,"" came the reply. A baffled Oke duly sent through pictures of his victory lap but failed to win over Yakmut, who chastised him for looking ""emotionless"". Two weeks later, Oke learned that his name had not been put forward by Nigerian officials for an Olympic Solidarity Scholarship training grant provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""We do not know the criteria used by the IOC,"" Solomon Ogba, then president of the AFN but now a board member, had told him in March 2015 when Oke had queried his absence. ""The selection was not done by us. What [we] did was send all the names to them,"" added Ogba, a vice-president of Nigeria's National Olympic Committee (NOC). Oke - pictured here smiling after winning gold at the 2015 All Africa Games - was told he was emotionless about his medal Concerned by the tone of Yakmut's mail, Oke wrote to the IOC to ask why it had rejected his application. ""Your name was not included in the list of scholarship requests we received from your NOC,"" came the IOC reply. When contacted by the BBC about the discrepancy between their versions of events, Ogba said: ""Athletes were asked to fill the forms which the NOC processed and sent to the IOC. Not all those - to the best of my knowledge - who filled the forms got the scholarship."" Despite lacking training funds, Oke did make it to Rio - after buying an expensive flight to Brazil at late notice when the AFN told him the government had not released funds on time. Told he would be refunded for his fare in Brazil, Oke realised this would not be the case upon arrival in Rio, so he spent the run-up to his event trying to secure his money, which equated to two months' salary. ""At this point my mind was definitely not on competing, it was on 'this is a huge amount',"" he said. Unlike 2012, Oke failed to reach the final. He says he is still owed for a third of his flight fare. The government says all flight fares have been paid in full. Sprinter Femi Ogunode represents Qatar Nigerian-born athletes hold the fastest 100m times on three different continents: Africa (Olusoji Fasuba, representing Nigeria) Europe (Francis Obikwelu, representing Portugal) Asia (Femi Ogunode, representing Qatar) Oke says he has repeatedly failed to receive significant funds due to him from Nigerian officials - primarily for training grants. Originating from the Nigerian government, the funds must pass through the AFN before reaching the athletes. While saying he did receive some grants, Oke claims he was deprived of at least $146,500 (Â£112,923) more by the AFN between 2010 and 2015. Tosin Oke won silver medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games Ogba rejects the allegations. ""The best thing is for him to petition the government who he claimed released money to the AFN,"" he told BBC Sport. ""As a matter of fact, most of the monies he claimed to have received were my personal assistance to him and other athletes."" When contacted by the BBC, the Nigerian government declined to comment on this matter. In December 2015, Oke sent a 10-page statement to the IAAF in which he outlined his allegations of funds being withheld from athletes as well as other claims about lax doping controls and mismanagement - all of which he largely blamed on then-AFN president Ogba. Ogba denies the allegations. In his letter, Oke also hoped that its recipient - IAAF President Lord Coe - would find his ""experiences serious enough to ask the right questions of the characters running the federation"". The IAAF responded to Oke's letter by sending a representative to meet the athlete, Ogba and the AFN's general secretary in March 2016. ""Having spent time with both Mr Oke and his federation [president and general secretary], the IAAF representative left reassured that the other issues canvassed by Mr Oke would be resolved between them,"" Huw Roberts, the IAAF's Legal Counsel, told BBC Sport. The IAAF did not confirm whether or not its representative had brought up the denial of funds at the meeting. Oke feels the IAAF effectively asked the AFN to investigate itself. Oke had also told the IAAF how he had witnessed insufficient doping controls in Nigeria. ""This year [2015], I saw an athlete enter the doping room claiming to be another athlete,"" he wrote. ""As ID is not asked for/checked, anything is possible."" The IAAF says that according to its representative, the issue was not raised in March 2016 when he met both Oke and Ogba. Oke maintains he did discuss wider concerns over doping in Nigeria with the representative, even if he did not directly address the matter above. ""The AFN, under my leadership, fought doping violations with every vigour we could muster,"" Ogba told BBC Sport. Nigeria's athletes did not manage to win a medal at the 2017 World Championships held in London Oke was not originally set to compete at the 2017 World Championships in London. As an area champion, he was qualified to do so but the AFN did not put his name forward on time. ""It was the duty of your National Federation to submit your entry in due course,"" the IAAF told Oke. ""At this late stage, with entry lists being already published, I am afraid there is nothing we can do."" When the BBC asked the IAAF about Oke's letter of 2015 and its various allegations, the initial response that came back two working days later largely dealt with the athlete's selection issues with Nigeria. It also revealed that the Nigerian had now been included in the World Championships - just six days before the event began. The IAAF told Oke this was due to ""exceptional"" circumstances. Oke, who says he had stopped training in the run-up since he was not expecting to be involved, finished in 25th place. Despite his experiences, the athlete still hopes to compete for Nigeria at next year's Commonwealth Games. He is not the only athlete to be frustrated by the way in which Nigerian athletics is run, with several having switched nationality to compete for other countries in recent years. Since the BBC wrote to the IAAF, the body's Athletics Integrity Unit - which became operational in April - has invited Oke to re-submit his claims. How I turned football into wine.

"The Department for Exiting the European Union has released what it calls a future partnership paper, laying out the government's plans for the UK's relationship with the EU after it leaves. The Reality Check team looks at some of the key parts ofthe document,external. ""The government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt."" The key part of the government's paper is the choice of two different destinations as it tries to negotiate a long-term solution. The first is ""a highly streamlined customs arrangement"", in which the UK leaves the customs union, but comes up with ways of simplifying the future customs regime between the UK and EU countries. That could include developing technology and negotiating other systems to speed things up at ports. But implementing such a complex scheme would take years of preparation. The other option proposed is a new customs partnership with the EU, which would do away with a customs border altogether. Agreeing to such a partnership, which doesn't really exist anywhere in the world, would be quite a concession for the EU as it would give the UK the benefits of being in the customs union while still allowing it to forge trade agreements with non-EU countries, which EU members are not allowed to do. ""People and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from an interim period."" The government wants an interim or transition period between the UK leaving the EU and the new permanent customs regime coming into effect. The paper suggests a time-limited period during which the UK leaves the customs union only to move straight into another temporary customs union with the EU that would operate in pretty much the same way - except, the UK wants to be able to negotiate and sign (but not implement) free trade deals with other countries outside the EU at the same time. ""The UK would aim to negotiate trade facilitations with the EU and implement unilateral improvements to our domestic regime."" ""The promotion of the free flow of trade in both directions between the UK and the EU would also require the EU to implement equivalent arrangements at its borders with the UK."" It is not clear which aspects of the streamlined arrangement would be unilateral and which would need agreement. The paper says, in paragraph 29, that the government would make unilateral improvements to its systems, to speed things up at ports. But then, in paragraph 30, it says that the EU would have to implement equivalent arrangements. ""Through membership of the Common Transit Convention (CTC), which simplifies border crossing for goods in transit."" The CTC is the set of rules for moving goods between EU member states and other countries, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Macedonia and Serbia. It is supposed to make it easier to move products from one country to another via a third country that is not necessarily an EU member. For the UK, the benefit would be that goods could be imported from Asia via the port of Rotterdam, for example, without having to pay EU duties. ""Negotiating mutual recognition of Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs), enabling faster clearance of AEOs' goods at the border."" AEOs are an international kitemark that recognises businesses as regular international traders that are solvent and have a good record of paying customs fees and taxes and keeping proper records. Companies holding the designation are allowed to use certain fast-track systems when going through customs. The government estimates that 60% of UK imports and 74% of UK exports involve companies with AEO status. ""Ensure that individuals travelling to the UK from the EU and vice versa can continue to travel with goods for personal use as freely and as smoothly as they do now."" The amount of alcohol and cigarettes that can be brought into the UK from non-EU countries without paying duty is limited - up to four litres of wine and 200 cigarettes. After Brexit, such limits could return for trips to and from the EU. But the government is keen to strike an agreement that ensures that does not happen. ""We acknowledge this is an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement."" The government says it wants to look into the ""practical complexities"" involved in a customs partnership, but the EU has already repeated its argument that frictionless trade outside the Customs Union and the Single Market is impossible. Would ministers be happier being ""innovative and untested"" than beingcourageous,external? ""We will continue to discuss these proposals with stakeholders over the summer and will publish a Customs White Paper in advance of the Customs Bill in the autumn."" If negotiations on the future partnership with the EU have not yet begun by the autumn, there may be a few blank spaces in the Customs White Paper that will have to be filled in later. And this week's paper also emphasises that the government will be ready for a ""no deal"" scenario that would necessitate ""standalone customs and excise systems"". ""This is not the government's preferred outcome,"" the paper says, ""but it is essential that the UK is prepared for all possible outcomes.""

"This video can not be played The moment parts of a tree fell on a crowd was caught on camera during a Facebook live A falling tree has killed at least 13 people and injured 49 at a religious ceremony on the Portuguese island of Madeira. A video shows the tree crashing down on a crowded square in a suburb of the main town, Funchal, spreading panic among people enjoying the festivities. Two children are reported to have been killed, and some of the injured are said to be foreign nationals. Reports suggest the tree which fell was an oak that was about 200 years old. As the island declared three days of mourning, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa arrived in a display of solidarity, telling reporters that ""all Portuguese people"" shared their shock. He was due to visit the scene of the disaster as well as a hospital and a civil defence facility. Madeira, a popular destination for European tourists, is the largest of a group of Portuguese islands in the north Atlantic Ocean, south-west of the Portuguese mainland. People had gathered outside a church in a village in the hills overlooking the town to celebrate the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption, which takes place on Tuesday and is a public holiday. The Lady of the Mount festival is the island's biggest. The square where the religious ceremony was taking place is surrounded by trees The tree came down just after midday (11:00 GMT) on Fountain Square, which has a Catholic shrine and other monuments, and is shaded by plane trees,according to the Funchal town website,external. ""I heard a great noise and when I looked at the tree it was already falling but was too fast and people started to run and those who couldn't run stayed under the tree,"" one unnamed eyewitness said. ""It was something we will never forget,"" said another. ""It sounded like shots and it just gave us time to look and run away when we realised there were people under the tree."" The president is due to visit the site where the tree fell later on Tuesday Emergency services flooded the area after the disaster, tending to the injured. Pedro Ramos, health secretary of the local government of Madeira, said the injured included German, Hungarian and French citizens, the Portuguese news site Publico reports. Witnesses quoted by Portuguese broadcaster RTP say the tree that fell had been shored up for at least two years because the trunk was hollow. People lit candles after the disaster President de Sousa said it was not for him to give an opinion on responsibility for the disaster as that was a ""matter for the regional authorities"". ""The president of the republic is conveying the clear, total and unconditional solidarity of the Portuguese,"" he said. This year's festival would have been all the more special because, Portuguese news site Publico notes, last year's event had to be cancelled due to forest fires. Danny Savage, BBC News High above Funchal, looking out across the Atlantic, is the village of Monte. Last night, the Catholic church, which attracts thousands of tourists, stood out like a beacon above the town, floodlit for the Feast of the Assumption. The cable car linking the town and the church worked late into the night taking thousands of people to and from the festivities. When we visited last week, parishioners were decorating the church altar in beautiful flowers. Friendly, cheerful, trying to make this year's festival special after wild fires destroyed the surrounding countryside last year leading the event to be cancelled. Today, thousands of people had gathered around the church again for a procession. A small square, close to where buses drop visitors, was busy when the tree came down. The crowd would have been mainly Portuguese but there are thousands of people from many other countries here at the moment, some of whom may have been caught up in this disaster.

"A CCTV image of the incident was leaked to the media Staff at Edinburgh Zoo have raised safety fears after a panda was let back into its enclosure while a keeper was still inside. A CCTV image of the narrow escape has been leaked to the media to highlight concerns by a group of workers who claim the zoo is in ""crisis"". Edinburgh Zoo has said staff reported the near miss last year, which was fully investigated. It is said no staff grievances have been raised or handled by its board. Despite their ""cuddly"" image, adult giant pandas can be as dangerous as black bears and there have been serious attacks on staff and visitors at other zoos around the world in recent years. Three visitors to Beijing Zoo were mauled between 2006 and 2009 after falling or jumping in to Giant Panda enclosures. In 2011, a Giant Panda bit a member of staff at San Diego Zoo in California. Other escapes from Edinburgh Zoo Over the past five years a red panda, a pelican and a huge bull are just some of the animals to have escaped their enclosures at Edinburgh Zoo. Others which have fled their cages include a red river hog, an ibis, a Bateleur eagle, a macaw and a Madagascan teal. The biggest of the escapees was a Heck cattle bull, which got out of its enclosure in 2012 and led to visitors being moved indoors. The adult male was on the loose for about 40 minutes before it was tranquillised by a team of keepers and vets. The data, released following a freedom of information request by the City of Edinburgh Council, also shows the week before the bull escaped, a scarlet ibis was recaptured after fleeing the zoo and evading its keepers for six days. The rare bird left its enclosure through a hole in the netting. The CCTV picture from Edinburgh Zoo appears to show the enclosure of the male bear, Yang Guang. The bear is just a few steps behind a female keeper who is making her way out of the door. In a leaked email which was sent to bosses by staff at the zoo it was claimed the institution was in ""crisis"", morale was at rock bottom, and that safety had been compromised. It was also suggested that Yang Guang could have escaped into the public area of the zoo as a result of the security failure in 2016. Edinburgh Zoo admitted there had been a ""near miss"" with the panda. The City of Edinburgh Council, which licenses the zoo, confirmed the incident took place and the zoo had ""revised"" its procedures. A spokesman for the Royal Zoological Society Scotland said: ""RZSS takes welfare of animals and staff extremely seriously and follows strict safety procedures, with any incidents duly reported to City of Edinburgh Council. ""Staff reported a near miss last year which was fully investigated and Edinburgh Council were kept informed throughout the process. No staff or animals were harmed during the incident. ""While we never comment on speculation or accusatory comments from anonymous sources, should any staff grievances be raised they are handled by our well-established Employee Consultative Board. ""We can confirm this has not occurred in this instance."" Edinburgh Zoo is the second most popular paying visitor attraction in Scotland. It attracted 574,000 visitors in 2016 - but that was 10% down on the previous year. It was hoped the arrival of giant pandas Tian Tian and Yang Guang in December 2011 would bring in extra revenue but the pair have so far failed to produce a cub. Elisa Allen, director of animal welfare charity Peta said: ""Those in zoos - even the so-called 'best zoos' - often go insane from the lack of mental and physical stimulation, making them all the more unpredictable. ""As long as we continue to treat wild animals as living exhibits, it'll only be a matter of time before we're talking about the next victim of a captive-animal attack."" The anonymous staff email stated: ""We areâ¦worried about the safety of staff. We have found out that there was a very serious near miss last year when a panda was let back into the enclosure with a keeper still cleaning in there and she could have been seriously injured or even have died. ""We got to hear about the near miss with the panda a while after it happened, just through rumour at first and then the keeper who experienced it went off sick and never came back. ""She heard it behind her just in time to be able to get out of the enclosure. If she hadn't she could have been mauled, seriously injured or even killed. ""We also know that the panda could have escaped into the public area of the zoo. Are we going to wait for a disaster to happen before things change at the zoo?"" ""We are seriously worried about our jobs and the future of the zoo. ""Some of the keepers are concerned about the welfare of the animals as sometimes they are so short-staffed and have little time it stops them giving proper care to the animals. ""There has been some near misses, mistakes and animal deaths because of it. ""Visitor numbers are very poor, Zoo Nights and the Ferris wheel were an embarrassing disaster and got a lot of poor web reviews, and the Chinese lantern festival looks like going the same way. ""There is a dreadful atmosphere around the zoo with staff morale the lowest we have ever known it.""

"This video can not be played Lesley Willett's father, a veteran suffering from dementia, was exploited by his neighbour A retired senior judge has warned the power of attorney lacks safeguards, saying he would never sign one himself. But Frank Willett, a Dunkirk and Normandy veteran, did - and was exploited by his neighbour Colin Blake. Frank's daughter, Lesley, lived 300 miles away from her father. She was in South Wales and he was in Yorkshire. Suffering from dementia and in his early 80s, in 2003 Frank made Blake his attorney, giving him responsibility for his financial affairs. Blake had befriended widower Mr Willett and took him to a local solicitor's office, where the document was drawn up for enduring power of attorney and Frank signed. Lesley and her husband Brian Felton believed Frank's assets were safe. But what they didn't realise was that just weeks after the papers were signed, Colin Blake had begun taking out large sums of money. Colin Blake eventually sold Frank Willett's house and moved to France ""I didn't think the bank would allow wholesale looting of someone's account,"" Lesley says. Her father had been a regular customer for years with the bank. He'd go in every week and cash a cheque for Â£70, and all of his bills were paid by direct debit. He had pensions from the army and the civil service as well as his state pension. He was careful with money and had built up substantial savings of Â£60,000. In February 2003, Blake withdrew nearly Â£9,000 from Mr Willett's account in a single transaction. As he had power of attorney, the bank didn't contact Brian and Lesley. Blake drew out more money, using the sums to pay his own bills. Mr Willett lived next door to Blake in Kirby Hill in Yorkshire, 300 miles away from his daughter Frank's health deteriorated and in September 2004 he was moved to a care home. Colin Blake registered the enduring power of attorney (EPA) with the Court of Protection, which allowed him to sell Frank's house, a two-bedroom bungalow in North Yorkshire. Lesley and Brian challenged the power of attorney in court - but they had no idea that Frank's savings account was empty, and they couldn't prove that Colin Blake was unfit to be Frank's attorney. The judge upheld the document, although he did order Blake to provide annual accounts to the court - a more stringent measure than the usual procedure. The couple and their solicitor repeatedly contacted the Public Guardianship Office, and the Court of Protection, which oversees attorneyship, saying they believed there were discrepancies in the accounts. But they were told everything was satisfactory. In early 2007, visiting her father in the care home in Yorkshire, Lesley learned that Blake was selling his own house, liquidating his company and moving to France. Frank's care bills were in arrears. Lesley knew her father's house had been sold for over Â£130,000 and could not understand where the money had gone. It was only in early 2008 that a new body - the Office of the Public Guardian - investigated, and revoked the power of attorney. Lesley was appointed deputy by the court instead - responsible for her father's finances under the court's supervision. She discovered all of her father's money had gone. Her father's medals - from 35 years service in the army - had gone. Her mother's wedding ring and her jewellery and all the family photographs and documents had also disappeared. ""It was devastating,"" she says. ""It took his memories."" She called the police, who began to investigate Blake. Lesley visited Frank for his birthday and took him to visit her mother's grave. She told him Blake wouldn't be bothering him any more, and that the care home staff and his family would be protecting him. ""He had tears streaming down his face and he said: 'That's the best birthday present I've ever had.'"" Frank died in 2009. Lesley and Brian had to go to court to overturn a will Frank had made under Blake's influence. The police pursued Blake to France. Last monthhe pleaded guilty to theftand was sentenced to four-and-a-half years. It's unlikely that Lesley will ever get any money back. But she wanted to see justice done for her father, and for others to learn from her experience. Lesley Willett was eventually appointed as her father's deputy, which meant she took over his affairs Since this case, there have been changes to power of attorney and the Court of Protection. In the past, a EPA could be drawn up with little oversight - but when it came to registration, it could be subject to scrutiny and challenge. All the relatives of the person concerned would be contacted at that point. Now with the newer Lasting Power of Attorney, or LPA, a professional, or someone who has known the subject of the order well for years, has to provide a certificate for the document to be drawn up - but registration has been made far simpler. Relatives are no longer contacted. Also, the Office of the Public Guardian, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, has more powers to investigate complaints about attorneys than its predecessor, the Public Guardianship Office. The retired judge, Denzil Lush, cited a recent case involving 94-year-old widow Gladys Meek, from Derbyshire. Her husband's niece and great niece were deputies. They used her money to buy cars, laptops, designer handbags, and season tickets to Derby County Football Club. But after a court decision, a Â£275,000 bond was called in and so the money could be recovered.

"More than 200 patients in England have been infected or contaminated with a drug-resistant fungus first found in Japan, health officials have confirmed. Hospitals are on the lookout for further cases and are putting in place measures to help control any further spread of the fungus,Candida auris. Public Health England says in some cases patients will have no symptoms, but the infection can cause serious bloodstream and wound infections. So far, no UK patient has died from it. The first UK case emerged in 2013. Since then, infection rates have been going up - although it remains rare. Candida aurisis proving hard to stop because it has developed some resistance to the drug doctors normally use against it. As of July, 20 separate NHS trusts and independent hospitals in the UK had detectedCandida auris. More than 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised withCandida auristransferred to them. Three hospitals have seen large outbreaks that have been difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures. These outbreaks have now been declared over, however, Public Health England says. Dr Colin Brown, from Public Health England's national infection service, said most of the UK cases had been detected by screening, rather than investigations for patients with symptoms. But 27 patients have developed bloodstream infections. ""Our enhanced surveillance shows a low risk to patients in healthcare settings. Most cases detected have not shown symptoms or developed an infection as a result of the fungus. ""NHS hospitals that have experienced outbreaks of Candida auris have not found it to be the cause of death in any patients."" He said PHE had updated its infection-control guidance for hospitals and nursing homes on managing outbreaks ofCandida auris, together witha leaflet for patients,externalwho may have the fungal infection. What isCandida auris? It belongs to a family of fungi or yeasts that live on the skin and inside the human body. A more common ""cousin"" in this family isCandida albicans, which causes the yeast infection thrush. Candida auriswas first identified in 2009 in a patient from Japan. Hospital outbreaks have since been reported in the United States, India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Oman, South Africa and Spain, as well as the UK. Some people can carry the infection without having any symptoms or being unwell. Patients in hospital who catch it may become sick, although infections are still usually minor. Candida auriscan cause more serious bloodstream and wound infections, however. Nursing staff can take swabs from different parts of a patient's body to check ifCandida aurisis present. That is still being investigated, but experts think it is spread by contact from person to person, on people's hands, clothing or on bits of medical equipment. Contamination is quick - several hospitals have reported it takes as little as four hours from initial exposure. Spread can be limited by good hygiene - keeping hands clean by frequent hand washing and using alcohol gel. If a patient in hospital is found to be infected, their visitors may be asked to wear a gown, plastic aprons and gloves. Antifungal medicines can treat the infection, despite the strain ofCandida aurisin the UK having some resistance to some of these drugs. A biosafety Investigation Unit at Porton Down, the government's military research base, is testing a variety of disinfectants and antiseptics to see if they can kill the infection.

"Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe has so far failed to appear in a South African court over an assault case despite officials saying she would do. South African police said in the late afternoon they did not know where Mrs Mugabe was. A 20-year-old South African woman has accused Mrs Mugabe of hitting her on the head with an extension cord during a confrontation at a hotel. She released an image of a face injury online. Mrs Mugabe has not commented. Gabriella Engels accused Mrs Mugabe, 52, of hitting her after finding her with her two sons in a hotel room in Sandton, a plush suburb north of Johannesburg, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports. The attack is said to have happened on Sunday evening. Africa Live: Updates on this and other African stories ""The negotiations over the suspect handing herself over have not concluded and our investigations have not finalised,"" police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo told AFP news agency. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula earlier said Mrs Mugabe had handed herself over to police but was not under arrest, and would appear in court early on Tuesday afternoon local time. Hours later Mr Naidoo clarified: ""The minister learned later that it just didn't materalise as it was supposed to."" This video can not be played Grace Mugabe may face assault charges In a phoneinterview for South Africa's News24,externalnews site, she said she and a friend had been visiting the sons, Robert and Chatunga, at the Capital 20 West Hotel. A bodyguard asked her and her friend to wait in a separate room, after which the assault occurred, she said. ""When Grace entered I had no idea who she was,"" she told News24. ""She walked in with an extension cord and just started beating me with it. She flipped and just kept beating me with the plug. Over and over. I had no idea what was going on. I was surprisedâ¦ I needed to crawl out of the room before I could run away. Grace Mugabe, 52, is the Zimbabwean president's second wife ""Her ten bodyguards just stood there watching, no-one did anything, no-one tried to help me."" ""There was blood everywhere,"" she added. ""Over my arms, in my hair, everywhere."" In a statement, they confirmed that on Monday an unnamed 20-year-old South African woman had registered a ""case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm"". She was ""allegedly assaulted by a prominent woman at a hotel in Sandton,"" they said, without naming Mrs Mugabe.

"Three people were checked over by London Ambulance Service but no-one was hurt Travellers have been advised to avoid London Waterloo until Thursday after a train derailed outside the station. The train partly left the tracks as it was pulling away from a platform at low speed at 05:40 BST, Network Rail said. Three people were checked over by London Ambulance Service but nobody was taken to hospital. Trains are unable to access 13 of the station's 24 platforms as 10 were already closed owing to engineering works to enlarge its capacity. Public transport in London was further disrupted when a passenger train crashed into buffers at King's Cross station and Holborn Tube station was evacuated because of a fire alert. The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK Waterloo works: What you wanted to know Emergency services including police, paramedics and fire crews were called to Waterloo. Insp Sean McGachie of British Transport Police (BTP) said ""very few passengers had been on board"" and officers were ""working with industry partners to investigate the circumstances"". The passenger train was carrying 23 passengers and two staff members when it crashed into a ""barrier train"" which had been in place to separate engineering works from operational trains, according to Network Rail. Chris Denham, a spokesman for Network Rail, told the BBC the partially derailed train had blocked three of the platforms so only very limited services could run. ""If you don't have to travel to Waterloo today, please don't,"" he said. The train hit a barrier wagon Passengers are being advised to use alternative routes South West Trains said there would be a very limited service running to and from Waterloo until Thursday and have advised travellers not to use their entire network. Many of the trains running have been cancelled or are stopping or starting short of the station, the rail operator said. Passengers have been warned other stations in the area will also be ""very busy"". Some stations including Waterloo, Vauxhall, Clapham Junction and Wimbledon all have queuing systems in place to manage the number of people on platforms. Passengers were already affected by ongoing engineering works The ongoing Â£800m engineering project at Waterloo will prepare the station for longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers during the busiest times of the day. The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK, with an average of 270,000 journeys made to and from it each day. The 05:13 from Royston to King's Cross hit buffers as it arrived at platform nine In north London, a Great Northern train hit the buffers at King's Cross station at 06:20. Natasha Coella, who had boarded the train at Stevenage, said passengers ""went flying"" as the train arrived at the station. ""No-one expected it and people just went from one end of the carriage to the other,"" she said. A spokesperson for the rail company said it had happened at low speed and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch had been informed. In a separate incident, Holborn Tube station was evacuated for a short period after reports that smoke had filled carriages on a Central line train. BTP said the problem had been caused by a defective train.

"This video can not be played Lesley Willett's father, a veteran suffering from dementia, was exploited by his neighbour A retired senior judge has warned the power of attorney lacks safeguards, saying he would never sign one himself. But Frank Willett, a Dunkirk and Normandy veteran, did - and was exploited by his neighbour Colin Blake. Frank's daughter, Lesley, lived 300 miles away from her father. She was in South Wales and he was in Yorkshire. Suffering from dementia and in his early 80s, in 2003 Frank made Blake his attorney, giving him responsibility for his financial affairs. Blake had befriended widower Mr Willett and took him to a local solicitor's office, where the document was drawn up for enduring power of attorney and Frank signed. Lesley and her husband Brian Felton believed Frank's assets were safe. But what they didn't realise was that just weeks after the papers were signed, Colin Blake had begun taking out large sums of money. Colin Blake eventually sold Frank Willett's house and moved to France ""I didn't think the bank would allow wholesale looting of someone's account,"" Lesley says. Her father had been a regular customer for years with the bank. He'd go in every week and cash a cheque for Â£70, and all of his bills were paid by direct debit. He had pensions from the army and the civil service as well as his state pension. He was careful with money and had built up substantial savings of Â£60,000. In February 2003, Blake withdrew nearly Â£9,000 from Mr Willett's account in a single transaction. As he had power of attorney, the bank didn't contact Brian and Lesley. Blake drew out more money, using the sums to pay his own bills. Mr Willett lived next door to Blake in Kirby Hill in Yorkshire, 300 miles away from his daughter Frank's health deteriorated and in September 2004 he was moved to a care home. Colin Blake registered the enduring power of attorney (EPA) with the Court of Protection, which allowed him to sell Frank's house, a two-bedroom bungalow in North Yorkshire. Lesley and Brian challenged the power of attorney in court - but they had no idea that Frank's savings account was empty, and they couldn't prove that Colin Blake was unfit to be Frank's attorney. The judge upheld the document, although he did order Blake to provide annual accounts to the court - a more stringent measure than the usual procedure. The couple and their solicitor repeatedly contacted the Public Guardianship Office, and the Court of Protection, which oversees attorneyship, saying they believed there were discrepancies in the accounts. But they were told everything was satisfactory. In early 2007, visiting her father in the care home in Yorkshire, Lesley learned that Blake was selling his own house, liquidating his company and moving to France. Frank's care bills were in arrears. Lesley knew her father's house had been sold for over Â£130,000 and could not understand where the money had gone. It was only in early 2008 that a new body - the Office of the Public Guardian - investigated, and revoked the power of attorney. Lesley was appointed deputy by the court instead - responsible for her father's finances under the court's supervision. She discovered all of her father's money had gone. Her father's medals - from 35 years service in the army - had gone. Her mother's wedding ring and her jewellery and all the family photographs and documents had also disappeared. ""It was devastating,"" she says. ""It took his memories."" She called the police, who began to investigate Blake. Lesley visited Frank for his birthday and took him to visit her mother's grave. She told him Blake wouldn't be bothering him any more, and that the care home staff and his family would be protecting him. ""He had tears streaming down his face and he said: 'That's the best birthday present I've ever had.'"" Frank died in 2009. Lesley and Brian had to go to court to overturn a will Frank had made under Blake's influence. The police pursued Blake to France. Last monthhe pleaded guilty to theftand was sentenced to four-and-a-half years. It's unlikely that Lesley will ever get any money back. But she wanted to see justice done for her father, and for others to learn from her experience. Lesley Willett was eventually appointed as her father's deputy, which meant she took over his affairs Since this case, there have been changes to power of attorney and the Court of Protection. In the past, a EPA could be drawn up with little oversight - but when it came to registration, it could be subject to scrutiny and challenge. All the relatives of the person concerned would be contacted at that point. Now with the newer Lasting Power of Attorney, or LPA, a professional, or someone who has known the subject of the order well for years, has to provide a certificate for the document to be drawn up - but registration has been made far simpler. Relatives are no longer contacted. Also, the Office of the Public Guardian, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, has more powers to investigate complaints about attorneys than its predecessor, the Public Guardianship Office. The retired judge, Denzil Lush, cited a recent case involving 94-year-old widow Gladys Meek, from Derbyshire. Her husband's niece and great niece were deputies. They used her money to buy cars, laptops, designer handbags, and season tickets to Derby County Football Club. But after a court decision, a Â£275,000 bond was called in and so the money could be recovered.

"Fans paid tribute to Ms Harris on social media The stuntwoman who died in a motorcycle accident while filming Deadpool 2 has been identified as SJ Harris. Ms Harris, who was reportedly the first licensed female African American road racer in the US, was killed on Monday morning in Vancouver, Canada. Eyewitnesses said she had lost control of the bike, jumped a kerb and crashed into a building. Deadpool 2 star Ryan Reynolds said he was ""heartbroken, shocked and devastated"" at her death. Production on the film has been temporarily halted. Local media say Ms Harris had successfully practised the stunt several times before the fatal accident. Ms Harris has previously been described as a pioneer encouraging more women and African Americans to enter professional road racing. Black Girls Ride Magazine,externalsaid in 2015 that she was ""leading the pack in more ways than one"". ""I am everything people never saw in this sport,"" Ms Harris told the magazine, adding that the high costs of road racing were a barrier, and most of her competitors were young, affluent white men. During her first race, she said: ""I was alone for most of the day, scared and in tears. I had no-one to talk to, and I didn't know what I needed."" ""Sisters on the track are few and far in between. I want to show them that there's more for them to be exposed to. I want to get kids interested through experience."" Reports suggest Deadpool 2 was Ms Harris's first film stunt job According to her online profile, Ms Harris had been racing professionally since 2012. Deadpool 2 was said to be her first film as a stunt performer. On the FAQ section ofher website,external, Ms Harris said that when it came to crashing, she was ""not quite scared, but it crosses my mind at times, but a racer can't let it stop us"". She said that ""everything takes time"", and encouraged readers to ""face your fears"".

"Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise in 1975 I can't name a new, young TV comedy double act and neither can Barry Cryer. The comedian and writer says: ""I want to spot a young double act and say 'oh boy, it's still going'. But it hasn't happened for me yet."" At the start of his career he wrote for the gold standard of comedy duos, Morecambe and Wise. ""It's like telepathy,"" Cryer says. ""It's rapport, a chemistry. They feed off each other."" At the height of their powers, Eric and Ernie raked in more than 28 million viewers. But out in the Edinburgh drizzle, scanning the listings boards and combing through the pile of leaflets I've been handed, it's slim pickings for double acts. They've overwhelmingly made way for stand-ups or comedy troupes. This video can not be played Barry Cryer on writing for Morecambe and Wise. ""It's what my generation chose to watch,"" a lady waiting for a show to start tells me. ""Your generation are happy with stand-up."" ""No offence nana, but Morecambe and Wise - nobody would watch that nowadays,"" her granddaughter chips in. For better or for worse they agree the comic double act is dead. But this is the largest arts festival in the world. Spend enough time in the sticky beer-smelling student union rooms which have been trussed up as venues, as you'll find that old staple of British television in rude health. The majority is sketch-based. Duos such as Goodbear or Studio 9. But old style variety has also had a revamp. Double Denim, comprising of Australian comedians Michelle Brasier and Laura Frew largely consists of games with the audience and group renditions of Shania Twain classics. Laura Anderson of Hurt and Anderson says double act stock is on the rise. ""Double acts mostly work as a sketch or a character comedy thing,"" she says. ""And as far as I can tell sketch is getting more and more popular again. It ebbed away and I think it's coming back."" Georgia Hurt and Laura Anderson, better known as Hurt and Anderson. When they started in 2011, they say there were almost no female comic duos on the fringe. ""Now we're treading them under foot,"" she says. ""They're everywhere!"" ""On the circuit. Not the mainstream consciousness,"" her comedy partner Georgia Hurt adds. After selling out their Edinburgh festival debut last year, Barney Fishwick and Will Hislop are back as the double act Giants. For a large proportion of their act they are Norwegian pop sensations. ""The EU is a big, beautiful dance floor"", they say. Everyone dancing together, ""or as we like to call it, the free movement of peoples"". ""The final product is this year"", Hislop jokes. They met at four days old and have been good friends ever since. Will Hislop and Barney Fishwick, known together as 'Giants', acting casual. Why a double act? Fishwick says it allows ""for conflict"", adding: ""It's that weird thing where there is this real chemistry, there's love at the basis of it."" ""There's also hate"", Hislop interjects. They say a connection is required, a trust which allows them to veer off in different directions during their act. ""We know each other's rhythms as it were, so we know what we're likely to think,"" Hislop says. ""So if there's someone in the front row wearing Crocs, I know that Barney finds Crocs really funny so I'll leave that to him because I don't have a lot of Crocs material."" As I queue for another show, I get the family next to me to list comedy double acts. ""Can I say Torvill and Dean?"". It seems comedy duos aren't back in the mainstream just yet.

"This video can not be played The moment parts of a tree fell on a crowd was caught on camera during a Facebook live A falling tree has killed at least 13 people and injured 49 at a religious ceremony on the Portuguese island of Madeira. A video shows the tree crashing down on a crowded square in a suburb of the main town, Funchal, spreading panic among people enjoying the festivities. Two children are reported to have been killed, and some of the injured are said to be foreign nationals. Reports suggest the tree which fell was an oak that was about 200 years old. As the island declared three days of mourning, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa arrived in a display of solidarity, telling reporters that ""all Portuguese people"" shared their shock. He was due to visit the scene of the disaster as well as a hospital and a civil defence facility. Madeira, a popular destination for European tourists, is the largest of a group of Portuguese islands in the north Atlantic Ocean, south-west of the Portuguese mainland. People had gathered outside a church in a village in the hills overlooking the town to celebrate the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption, which takes place on Tuesday and is a public holiday. The Lady of the Mount festival is the island's biggest. The square where the religious ceremony was taking place is surrounded by trees The tree came down just after midday (11:00 GMT) on Fountain Square, which has a Catholic shrine and other monuments, and is shaded by plane trees,according to the Funchal town website,external. ""I heard a great noise and when I looked at the tree it was already falling but was too fast and people started to run and those who couldn't run stayed under the tree,"" one unnamed eyewitness said. ""It was something we will never forget,"" said another. ""It sounded like shots and it just gave us time to look and run away when we realised there were people under the tree."" The president is due to visit the site where the tree fell later on Tuesday Emergency services flooded the area after the disaster, tending to the injured. Pedro Ramos, health secretary of the local government of Madeira, said the injured included German, Hungarian and French citizens, the Portuguese news site Publico reports. Witnesses quoted by Portuguese broadcaster RTP say the tree that fell had been shored up for at least two years because the trunk was hollow. People lit candles after the disaster President de Sousa said it was not for him to give an opinion on responsibility for the disaster as that was a ""matter for the regional authorities"". ""The president of the republic is conveying the clear, total and unconditional solidarity of the Portuguese,"" he said. This year's festival would have been all the more special because, Portuguese news site Publico notes, last year's event had to be cancelled due to forest fires. Danny Savage, BBC News High above Funchal, looking out across the Atlantic, is the village of Monte. Last night, the Catholic church, which attracts thousands of tourists, stood out like a beacon above the town, floodlit for the Feast of the Assumption. The cable car linking the town and the church worked late into the night taking thousands of people to and from the festivities. When we visited last week, parishioners were decorating the church altar in beautiful flowers. Friendly, cheerful, trying to make this year's festival special after wild fires destroyed the surrounding countryside last year leading the event to be cancelled. Today, thousands of people had gathered around the church again for a procession. A small square, close to where buses drop visitors, was busy when the tree came down. The crowd would have been mainly Portuguese but there are thousands of people from many other countries here at the moment, some of whom may have been caught up in this disaster.

"North Korean state media released photos of Kim Jong-un apparently reviewing military documents North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reviewed plans to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam but will hold off, state media said. Although prepared for ""the enveloping fire at Guam"", the North said it would watch what ""the foolish Yankees"" do before taking a decision. Last week's threat against Guam escalated the sharp rhetoric being exchanged between the two sides. This latest report points to a pause in the increasingly bitter war of words. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in meanwhile has urged the US not to launch an attack on the Korean peninsula without its consent, saying ""no-one may decide to take military action without the consent"" of the South. In a separate incident in Guam, an emergency alert was broadcast in error on a radio station warning residents of ""civil danger"" on the island. The Guam Homeland Security Office said the alert, which went out shortly after midnight on Tuesday, was a result of human error and would not happen again. In astatement posted on Facebook,external, the office said that the broadcast was ""an unscheduled test"" and urged both residents and visitors to ""remain calm"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? What could North Korea do? North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war The report on state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un ""examined the plan for a long time"" and discussed it with senior military officials. The commander of North Korea's strategic force was now merely waiting for orders ""after rounding off the preparations for the enveloping fire at Guam"". But, crucially, the report also said that Mr Kim would watch the US before making any decision, signalling an apparent deceleration in the provocative rhetoric. Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Correspondents say that after days of menacing threats it might seem that Kim Jong-un could be in the mood to finally hit the pause button -  but in a nation as secretive as North Korea, one can never be sure. Analysts say it could simply mean Pyongyang is not fully ready to launch an attack on Guam, so it could just be buying more time. South Korea and China - North Korea's closest ally - have been urging calm and a renewed push for diplomatic resolutions. On Tuesday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the US should not act unilaterally. The two countries'defence agreement,externalstates that they must ""consult together"" when either is threatened. Questions are being raised about whether America would need South Korea's approval to strike back at North Korea if Guam was attacked. According to international law, and the military agreement between South Korea and the US, it does not. So why would President Moon say no military action could be taken without Seoul's ""consent""? Professor Hwee Rhak Park from Kookmin University says it might be a gesture towards liberals in South Korea - who are the president's main supporters - to show that the government is in control of the situation. South Korea is often criticised by its northern neighbour for being a puppet of the US, so this could also be a veiled message to America to tone down the rhetoric. Whatever he means, the South Korean president's stance has been quite clear from the start. He wants a diplomatic resolution, and has reiterated that he's open to talks with Pyongyang. The K-pop concert seeking to broker Korean peace China's foreign ministry on Monday reiterated its""suspension for suspension proposal"",external, where North Korea stops its missile tests in exchange for a freeze on military exercises by the US and South Korea. China imposes N Korea imports ban This video can not be played Yogita Limaye reports from the ""peace concert"" which drew large crowds Defence Secretary James Mattis earlier warned that any attack could quickly escalate into war, and if Pyongyang fired a missile towards Guam, ""then it's game on"". He told reporters that the US military would defend the country ""from any attack, at any time and from any quarter"". He also sought to reassure residents of Guam, home to US military bases and about 160,000 people, that they were well-protected and if a missile was fired, ""we'll take it out"". It comes after President Trump threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"", saying: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded."" The governor of Guam, Eddie Baza Calvo, has praised Mr Trump's rhetoric, saying it ensured the US position was clearly understood. This video can not be played Guam governor Eddie Baza Calvo told the BBC the US president's approach provided ""clarity"" North Korea threats unsettle Guam islanders The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits. Guam profile from BBC Monitoring Over the past year North Korea has stepped up its missile tests, despite repeated warnings from all quarters. The state had already conducted five nuclear tests, but then in July it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) claiming it now had the ability to hit the US mainland. The UN then approved fresh economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The measures aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Pyongyang reacted furiously to the new sanctions, calling them a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"" and warning that the US would ""pay a price"". Last week, US media reported that North Korea had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. Although not confirmed, this was seen as North Korea overcoming a final obstacle to becoming a fully nuclear-armed state.

"Under-23 team manager and former player David Unsworth said it was ""the most rewarding thing I've ever done"" Everton FC's under-23 team have helped raise Â£245,000 to buy a house for young people at risk of becoming homeless. The money will be used to buy and run a house near Goodison Park for 16 to 23-year-olds who have fallen on hard times and need a place to stay in Liverpool. The scheme is being run in conjunction with the club's official charity, Everton in the Community. Under-23 team manager and former player David Unsworth said it was ""the most rewarding thing I've ever done"". ""We've done something special and we will continue to help, support and fund the project,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Johnny Depp and his wife Amber Heard expressed remorse in a video message made public by the Australian Department of Agriculture It was a free shot that proved too irresistible to pass up. When Australian Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce was revealed to be aNew Zealand dual citizenon Monday - possibly in violation of constitutional rules - social media users joked about what Amber Heard and Johnny Depp might think. The actors were famously targeted by Mr Joyce for breaking rules of their own: failing to declare their dogs, Pistol and Boo, to Australian officials in 2015. Mr Joyce had threatened to havethe dogs put down, prompting Heard and Depp to release astilted apology videofor defying the biosecurity laws of Australia - which they called ""a wonderful island"". The saga made headlines around the world and waswidely enjoyed online, where it was dubbed the #WarOnTerrier. So it was probably no surprise that Mr Joyce's citizenship trouble - which is bound for Australia's High Court - generated clamour of its own. Allow Twitter content?

"Denzil Lush says the power of attorney can have a ""devastating"" effect on families A retired senior judge has warned of the lack of safeguards in the power of attorney system in England and Wales. Denzil Lush says people should be far more aware of the risks and has vowed to never sign one himself. The enduring or lasting power of attorney is a legal document, which allows someone to make your financial decisions when you can no longer do so. Last year, almost 650,000 applications were made to register the document and there are 2.5m currently registered. A power of attorney can, Mr Lush warns, have a ""devastating"" effect on family relationships. For 20 years he was the senior judge in the Court of Protection, which looks after the interests of people who do not have the capacity to look after themselves. Mr Lush, the author of the definitive legal guide to this area, has adjudicated in 6,000 power of attorney cases. In a new foreword to his book, he says the ""lack of transparency causes suspicions and concerns which tend to rise in a crescendo and eventually explode"". He says the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has been ""disingenuous"" in promoting them. The legal document's popularity has been the result, he says, of a ""vigorous campaign"" by the MoJ and its agency the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), which administers the system. A report by Brunel University in 2016 found that there was no systematic collection of official data on financial abuse. This is despite local authority safeguarding returns indicating it was the third most common form of abuse. This video can not be played A neighbour stole thousands of pounds from Lesley Willett's father Frank Willett, a Dunkirk and Normandy veteran,was exploited by his neighbour Colin Blake. In 2003, when Frank was in his early 80s and suffering from dementia, he made his neighbour Colin Blake his attorney, giving him responsibility for his financial affairs. That year, Blake withdrew nearly Â£9,000 from Mr Willett's account in a single transaction. As he had power of attorney, the bank didn't contact Mr Willett's relatives. Blake drew out more money, using the sums to pay his own bills. In early 2008, Mr Willett's daughter Lesley managed to revoke the power of attorney but discovered all of her father's money had gone. His medals - from 35 years service in the Army - had gone too. Her mother's wedding ring and her jewellery and all the family photographs and documents had also disappeared. ""It was devastating,"" she said. ""It took his memories."" Read more on Frank's story here Mr Lush described it as a ""crusade"" which ""demonised"" the legal alternative - the appointment of deputies by the Court of Protection itself. The retired judge said there is far more scrutiny from the outset with a deputy as they have to provide a full list of assets, and annual accounts. Deputies also have to provide a security bond, which can be easily claimed if there is a problem with money being spent inappropriately. It is more expensive than power of attorney, but Mr Lush believes it is worth Â£320 a year to have the safeguards. The Ministry of Justice said: ""Safeguarding vulnerable people is our priority. ""We take swift action if any abuse is reported and have a zero tolerance approach to any attorney or deputy who breaks the law."" They also said the number of investigations into attorneys by the Office of the Public Guardian had risen by nearly 50% compared with last year.

"Intel chief Brian Krzanich said there should be ""no hesitation in condemning hate speech"" US President Donald Trump hit back at business leaders on Tuesday as executives tried to distance themselves from the administration. Mr Trump is under fire for being late to condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis involved in a violent rally. But Mr Trump said: ""They're leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside."" Shortly after Mr Trump's comments, a fifth group stepped down from a White House business panel. Those who have quit the manufacturing council in recent days include Kenneth Frazier of Merck, Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Brian Krzanich of Intel and Scott Paul, the president of business group the Alliance for American Manufacturing. On Tuesday evening, after a combative news conference in which Mr Trump defended his original statement that violence came from ""many sides"", Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labour group, also said he and Thea Lee, another leader of the organisation, would no longer participate. ""It's clear that President Trump's manufacturing council was never an effective means for delivering real policy that lifts working families and his remarks today were the last straw,"" he said. As calls mount for corporations to respond, other firms participating on White House panels have issued statements condemning the violence. Walmart, which typically avoids political controversy, shared a statement from its chief executive that said Mr Trump ""missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists"". However, Walmart boss Doug McMillon did not say he would step down from the panel. Shannon Coulter, who co-founded the #grabyourwallet boycott against companies that do business with Mr Trump, said recent events have added momentum to the campaign. ""Charlottesville has definitely escalated the issue of associating oneself with the Trumps,"" she told the BBC. ""I think it's increasingly clear to CEOs on his councils that the Trump name and identity is toxic and that for the sake of their brands they need to get away from it as quickly as possible."" This video can not be played How the internet united against neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site Kenneth Frazier, the head of drugs giant Merck, led the walkout from the White House manufacturing council on Monday morning. One of only a handful of black leaders of Fortune 500 companies, Mr Frazier said he would no longer participate, calling it a matter of ""personal conscience"". Donald Trump and Ken Frazier during a previous White House meeting Mr Frazier said: ""I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."" ""America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."" In response, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Frazier would now have ""more time to lower rip-off drug prices"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Frazier's decision sparked calls from the public for other leaders involved in Mr Trump's panels to follow suit. Kevin Plank, the chief executive of sports apparel company Under Armour, said he was resigning on Monday night. His decision came after he faced backlash from shoppers - and some Under Armour-sponsored athletes - earlier this year when he praised Mr Trump's pro-business views. Intel boss Brian Krzanich also said on Monday that he would resign, followed by Scott Paul of the manufacturing alliance on Tuesday. Mr Trump dismissed the resignations, saying those companies relied on overseas manufacturing. ""They're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country,"" he said. ""We want jobs, manufacturing in this country."" Under Armour boss Kevin Plank (seated right) came under pressure to resign from the council. Many executives, including those at companies such as Campbell Soup Co and General Electric, said they feel it is important to remain involved. ""We must engage if we hope to change the world and those who lead it,"" Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement. But the resignations this week add to Mr Trump's growing alienation from the business community, which he had expected to claim as an ally. Former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick left a business advisory council in February over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney's chief executive Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum in June, after Mr Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Mr Musk also left the manufacturing council. Rashad Robinson is executive director of Color of Change, which is among the groups that have brought pressure on corporations. He said he hoped it would help make it clear that Mr Trump's attitude toward white supremacists and neo-Nazis was unacceptable. ""The more desertions and defections, the more isolated this administration is, the less mainstream connections that this administration has, the more powerful this message is to every day Americans about how out of step what's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is and why we need a change, "" he said. Companies that cut ties with the White House are likely to face costs, said Jiekun Huang, a professor of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is co-author of a study that linked higher stock prices to White House visits, based on records from the Obama administration. An initial review of the first six months of the Trump administration showed a similar effect, he said. But the risk of losing access to discuss regulations or contracts must be weighed against the risk of alienating employees and consumers, said Michael Maslansky, head of Maslansky + Partners, a language strategy firm that has advised major companies. ""The era of the fence-sitter corporation is over,"" he said. ""If you're silent about an issue, then each side will assume you're on the wrong side. You end up really having to choose.""

"Millions of rail users in the UK will see the price of regulated rail fares rise by up to 3.6% in January. The permitted increase - which is taken from the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for July - will be the highest since January 2013. Passenger groups said commuters would be worst-hit, and suggested that the RPI measure should be scrapped. The most widely watched and used measure, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), wasunchanged at 2.6%.,external Why will train fares go up next January? Cheaper rail fares on day of departure The fare rises will affect ""anytime"" and some off-peak fares as well as season tickets in England and Wales. In Scotland, it is mainly commuters who will be affected, with off-peak fares rising by a smaller amount. The Scottish government currently limits rises in off-peak fares to RPI minus 1%. There are no plans for increases in Northern Ireland. Unregulated fares, which include super off-peak travel and advance tickets, will be set in December. Transport Focus, which represents the interests of passengers, said rail users were already fed up with getting poor value for money. David Sidebottom, director of Transport Focus, said: ""Yet again, passengers, now majority funders of the railway, face fare rises next January. Commuters do not give value for money on their railways a high satisfaction score - just one third according to our latest survey. Transport Focus also queried the use of the RPI measure to determine fare increases: ""Why is the Government not using its preferred measure of inflation: the one that is used to determine wages and pension increases, and one which is often lower than RPI? Why not use the Consumer Prices Index for rail fares too?"" The CPI measure has gradually replaced the RPI over the past few years as the benchmark for changes to most government-controlled funding. James Tucker from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was not in favour of using RPI as a benchmark: ""We know there will be a focus on the RPI this month, but the National Statistician has been clear it is not a good measure and we do not recommend its use."" The Department for Transport rejected the idea of using CPI, saying RPI was used across the rail industry - for example in calculating the cost of running train services. The government said fare increases were justified by improvements to the network. ""We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Transport said. ""We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger.""

The coalition government continued the policy of shifting the financial burden to the wallets of passengers, though with less aggressive price increases than before. A research paper, published earlier this year by the House of Commons Library, cited earlier figures from the rail regulator in March 2016 showing that ""passengers have contributed an increasing proportion of the rail industry's income relative to taxpayers over the past four years - up from 55.6% in 2010-11 to 65% in 2014-15."" Oh the irony... regulated fares were meant to be the government's way of stopping private rail firms from overcharging passengers. They apply to tickets where people don't have much choice but to go by train: commuting into big cities, for example. But for many years, ministers have deliberately used the system to put prices up anyway. Why? Because they want passengers to pay a bigger chunk of the rail bill, so that the government pays less. Fares used to account for about half the cost of running our trains. Today it's about 70%. It does mean, of course, that people who don't commute by train, which is most of the country, pay less to subsidise the system. But that's little consolation to workers who've faced consistent price rises that have often outpaced their salary. Even allowing for inflation, rail fares have gone up by about 25% since the mid-1990s. I've spoken to many passengers - often young people at the start of their careers - who're on the brink of changing jobs because they can't afford the increases.

"Hundreds marched silently on Monday to mark two months since the fire The actions of Kensington and Chelsea Council are to be considered in the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry,the government has announced,external. The inquiry will also look at the adequacy of regulations, the tower's recent refurbishment, and the response of authorities in the aftermath. Broader questions on social housing will not be included, which campaigners say are central to the situation. Labour says the inquiry was ""closing off criticism of government policy"". However, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would meet social housing tenants to ""discuss the challenges they face"" and would be setting out further proposals ""in due course"". At least 80 people are thought to have died in the fire in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June. Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire What happened at Grenfell Tower? The full terms of reference for the public inquiry, which have been accepted in full by the prime minister, are: The cause and spread of the fire The design, construction and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower The scope and adequacy of the relevant regulations relating to high-rise buildings Whether the relevant legislation and guidance were complied with in the case of Grenfell Tower The actions of the local authority and other bodies before the tragedy The response of the London Fire Brigade to the fire and the response of central and local government in the aftermath Sir Martin had faced calls to step down as head of the Grenfell Tower inquiry The judge heading the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, hadpreviously said its scope could be much more limited. Karim Mussilhy is still waiting for the remains of his uncle to be found and identified. Asked whether he has confidence in the inquiry, he said: ""I support itâ¦(but) confidence is a very strong word. I have more confidence in the criminal investigation than I do the public inquiry."" Joe Delaney from the Grenfell Action Group has raised concerns about how the inquiry will scrutinise Kensington and Chelsea Council. Speaking on Radio 4's PM, Mr Delaney said: ""If it is interpreted as narrowly as it seems Sir Martin Moore-Bick instinctively seems to interpret things then we may have a serious problem."" Meanwhile, campaigners including Justice4Grenfell (J4G) and Labour MP David Lammy, who knew a victim of the fire, have raised concerns over the exclusion of social issues. The mayor of London said in a statement questions should be answered ""if the community's shattered confidence is to be restored"". Sadiq Khanurged Sir Martin,externalto do ""everything in his power"" to publish the interim report as quickly as possible. J4G spokeswoman Yvette Williams said the group would consider working with Sir Martin if he appointed community advisers. This video can not be played ""You don't respect me"": Footage from the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick defending his position Local MP Emma Dent Coad said the scope ""will not get to the heart of the problem"". The shadow fire minister said the terms ""touch on concerns"" but that political decisions need to be looked into after it was made ""perfectly permissible to put combustible materials on a tower block"". The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council said it was fully cooperating with the inquiry. ""We must find out what went wrong and make sure it never happens again, not only in this borough, but anywhere in the UK,"" Elizabeth Campbell added. Meanwhile, Sir Martin has suggested that a failure to address the long-term immigration status of some survivors could hinder his work. He urged the government to ""take all necessary steps"" to encourage those living in the building illegally to come forward, adding that it could deprive the investigation of ""valuable"" evidence if they didn't. The government responded to his concerns by pointing to a 12-month amnesty that would allow such individuals temporary lawful residence in the UK. The inquiry has now officially begun and will hold its first hearing on 14 September, with an initial report by Easter. The terms of reference were determined following consideration of more than 550 submissions. The Met has said it would investigate ""all criminal offences that may have been committed"". The Institution of Occupational Safety and Health - a chartered body - submitted a response to the consultation. It says the inquiry should be ""a watershed for fire safety"".

"Michael Le (left) and Khong Tam Tanh (right) were found guilty Three Britons have been sentenced to jail and caning in Singapore for having sex with a drunk and unconscious woman. Khong Tam Thanh, Vu Thai Son, and Michael Le went on trial this week for raping a woman in a hotel room in the city-state in September. The three men, who are in their early 20s, later pleaded guilty to reduced charges. They received sentences of up to six-and-a-half years in jail and eight strokes of the cane. The men flew in to Singapore last year with a group of friends for a stag party and to attend a music festival. One of their friends later met the woman, a Malaysian, at a nightclub and she consented to have sex with him at his hotel room. She later passed out, and the three men then took turns to have sex with her. The woman woke up while Le was on top of her, and lodged a police report later. The men were eventually found guilty of aggravated outrage of modesty and wrongful restraint of the woman under reduced charges in an apparent plea deal, reportedlocal media,external. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Singapore said the three men looked visibly relieved in court after the judge delivered their sentences. Our correspondent says the case has generated some controversy in Singapore, with some on social media questioning how the Britons were able to get reduced charges.

"This photo of Taylor Swift (centre) and David Mueller (right) was a key piece of evidence in court Pop star Taylor Swift has won a sexual assault case against ex-radio DJ David Mueller, who she said had groped her at a 2013 concert. He assaulted her by grabbing her bottom beneath her skirt as a photo was taken, a jury in Denver, Colorado, found. She was awarded a symbolic $1 (77p) in damages that she had sought. Mr Mueller had originally tried to sue the pop star, saying that her claims had cost him his job. But that lawsuit was thrown out by a judge last week. On Monday, the jury also rejected similar claims Mueller had made against the singer's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell. In a statement following the verdict, Ms Swift said: ""I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. Four reasons the case is significant Is courtroom sketch a good drawing of Taylor Swift? Pop star doesn't back down in court ""My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves."" The assault took place during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour. Taylor Swift (left) was present throughout the trial, often with her mother Andrea (second right) Mr Mueller, then a host on the radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. The singer complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later. 'He grabbed under my skirt' Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court Last Friday, Ms Swift's former bodyguard gave evidence, supporting her sex assault claims by testifying that he saw the DJ reach under her skirt. Greg Dent told the Colorado court he ""did not see his hand touch her physically"", but ""saw his hand under her skirt"".

"Indian police have arrested four people suspected of leaking an episode of the hugely popular TV show Game of Thrones before it was aired. Three of the accused are current employees of Prime Focus Technology, while one is a former employee. Prime Focus, a Mumbai-based company that stores and processes the series for Indian streaming website Hotstar, had lodged a complaint with police. The fantasy series is already the most pirated show in TV history. Episode four of the seventh season was leaked on 4 August, days before it was due to air globally. The show produced by HBO has seen several leaks over the years. Most recently a group of hackers said they had stolen 1.5TB of data, allegedly including episodes of Ballers, Room 104 and scripts from Game of Thrones episodes. On Mondaythey leaked some of the unaired material. The arrests on Monday were related to the leaked episode, not the most recent hack. After receiving a complaint ""we investigated the case and have arrested four individuals for unauthorised publication of the fourth episode from season seven,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Akbar Pathan told AFP news agency. The four have been charged with criminal breach of trust and computer related offences and will be detained until 21 August, he said.

"North Korean state media released photos of Kim Jong-un apparently reviewing military documents North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reviewed plans to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam but will hold off, state media said. Although prepared for ""the enveloping fire at Guam"", the North said it would watch what ""the foolish Yankees"" do before taking a decision. Last week's threat against Guam escalated the sharp rhetoric being exchanged between the two sides. This latest report points to a pause in the increasingly bitter war of words. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in meanwhile has urged the US not to launch an attack on the Korean peninsula without its consent, saying ""no-one may decide to take military action without the consent"" of the South. In a separate incident in Guam, an emergency alert was broadcast in error on a radio station warning residents of ""civil danger"" on the island. The Guam Homeland Security Office said the alert, which went out shortly after midnight on Tuesday, was a result of human error and would not happen again. In astatement posted on Facebook,external, the office said that the broadcast was ""an unscheduled test"" and urged both residents and visitors to ""remain calm"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? What could North Korea do? North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war The report on state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un ""examined the plan for a long time"" and discussed it with senior military officials. The commander of North Korea's strategic force was now merely waiting for orders ""after rounding off the preparations for the enveloping fire at Guam"". But, crucially, the report also said that Mr Kim would watch the US before making any decision, signalling an apparent deceleration in the provocative rhetoric. Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Correspondents say that after days of menacing threats it might seem that Kim Jong-un could be in the mood to finally hit the pause button -  but in a nation as secretive as North Korea, one can never be sure. Analysts say it could simply mean Pyongyang is not fully ready to launch an attack on Guam, so it could just be buying more time. South Korea and China - North Korea's closest ally - have been urging calm and a renewed push for diplomatic resolutions. On Tuesday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the US should not act unilaterally. The two countries'defence agreement,externalstates that they must ""consult together"" when either is threatened. Questions are being raised about whether America would need South Korea's approval to strike back at North Korea if Guam was attacked. According to international law, and the military agreement between South Korea and the US, it does not. So why would President Moon say no military action could be taken without Seoul's ""consent""? Professor Hwee Rhak Park from Kookmin University says it might be a gesture towards liberals in South Korea - who are the president's main supporters - to show that the government is in control of the situation. South Korea is often criticised by its northern neighbour for being a puppet of the US, so this could also be a veiled message to America to tone down the rhetoric. Whatever he means, the South Korean president's stance has been quite clear from the start. He wants a diplomatic resolution, and has reiterated that he's open to talks with Pyongyang. The K-pop concert seeking to broker Korean peace China's foreign ministry on Monday reiterated its""suspension for suspension proposal"",external, where North Korea stops its missile tests in exchange for a freeze on military exercises by the US and South Korea. China imposes N Korea imports ban This video can not be played Yogita Limaye reports from the ""peace concert"" which drew large crowds Defence Secretary James Mattis earlier warned that any attack could quickly escalate into war, and if Pyongyang fired a missile towards Guam, ""then it's game on"". He told reporters that the US military would defend the country ""from any attack, at any time and from any quarter"". He also sought to reassure residents of Guam, home to US military bases and about 160,000 people, that they were well-protected and if a missile was fired, ""we'll take it out"". It comes after President Trump threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"", saying: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded."" The governor of Guam, Eddie Baza Calvo, has praised Mr Trump's rhetoric, saying it ensured the US position was clearly understood. This video can not be played Guam governor Eddie Baza Calvo told the BBC the US president's approach provided ""clarity"" North Korea threats unsettle Guam islanders The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits. Guam profile from BBC Monitoring Over the past year North Korea has stepped up its missile tests, despite repeated warnings from all quarters. The state had already conducted five nuclear tests, but then in July it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) claiming it now had the ability to hit the US mainland. The UN then approved fresh economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The measures aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Pyongyang reacted furiously to the new sanctions, calling them a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"" and warning that the US would ""pay a price"". Last week, US media reported that North Korea had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. Although not confirmed, this was seen as North Korea overcoming a final obstacle to becoming a fully nuclear-armed state.

"People who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of heart disease even if they appear medically healthy, experts are warning. The work, in theEuropean Heart Journal,external, isfurther evidenceagainst the idea people can be ""fat but fit"". The researchers studied health data on more than half a million people in 10 European countries, including the UK. Normal blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels were no assurance of good heart health among obese people. After a follow-up period of more than 12 years, 7,637 of the people in the study had developed heart disease. Weight appeared to be a risk factor. In the study, people who were overweight or obese but had healthy blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol readings were about 28% more likely to develop heart disease than individuals with similar readings and a healthy bodyweight. Being fat and ""metabolically unhealthy"" - having high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar - was riskier still. Are you a healthy weight for your height?,external The researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge say the findings are a reminder that carrying too much fat can store up health problems for the future. Dr Ioanna Tzoulaki, from Imperial's School of Public Health, said: ""I think there is no longer this concept of healthy obese. ""If anything, our study shows that people with excess weight who might be classed as 'healthy' haven't yet developed an unhealthy metabolic profile. ""That comes later in the timeline, then they have an event, such as a heart attack."" According to the researchers, the excess weight itself may not be increasing the risk of heart disease directly, but rather over time through mechanisms such as increased blood pressure and high glucose. Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research, said: ""The take-home message here is that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key step towards maintaining a healthy heart.""

"Prince Sultan bin Turki, pictured centre Between 2015 and 2017, three Saudi princes living in Europe disappeared. All were critical of the Saudi government - and there is evidence that all were abducted and flown back to Saudi Arabiaâ¦ where nothing further has been heard from them. Early in the morning on 12 June 2003, a Saudi prince is being driven to a palace on the outskirts of Geneva. His name is Sultan bin Turki bin Abdulaziz, and the palace belongs to his uncle, the late King Fahd. It's the king's favourite son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, who has invited him to breakfast. Abdulaziz asks Sultan to return to Saudi Arabia - where he says a conflict over Sultan's criticisms of the Saudi leadership will be resolved. Sultan refuses, at which point Abdulaziz excuses himself to make a phone call. The other man in the room, the Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs, Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh, leaves too and after a few moments masked men rush in. They beat Sultan and handcuff him, then a needle is plunged into his neck. Unconscious, Sultan is rushed to Geneva airport - and carried on to a Medevac plane that is conveniently waiting on the tarmac. Such, at least, is Sultan's account of the events, as told to a Swiss court many years later. Among Sultan's staff, waiting at a Geneva hotel for him to return from his breakfast appointment, was his communications officer, Eddie Ferreira. ""Progressively, as the day went on the silence became deafening,"" he remembers. ""We couldn't reach the security team. That was the first real alert. We tried to contact the prince; there was no response, no answer."" Then, in the afternoon, two unexpected visitors arrived. ""The Saudi ambassador to Switzerland came in with the general manager of the hotel and quite simply just told everybody to vacate the penthouse and get out,"" Ferreira says. ""The prince was in Riyadh, our services were no longer required, and we could leave."" What had Prince Sultan done that could have led his family to violently drug and kidnap him? The previous year he had arrived in Europe for medical treatment, and started giving interviews critical of the Saudi government. He condemned the country's record on human rights, complained about corruption among princes and officials, and called for a series of reforms. Ever since 1932, when King Abdulaziz, known as Ibn Saud, founded Saudi Arabia, the country has been ruled as an absolute monarchy. It does not tolerate dissent. Prince Turki bin Bandar meets Pakistan's finance minister in 2003 Prince Turki bin Bandar was once a major in the Saudi police, with responsibility for policing the royal family itself. But a bitter family dispute over a contested inheritance landed him in prison, and on his release he fled to Paris, where, in 2012, he began posting videos on YouTube calling for reform in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis reacted as they had with Prince Sultan, and tried to persuade Turki to return. When Ahmed al-Salem, the deputy minister of the interior called, the prince recorded the conversation and posted it online. ""Everybody's looking forward to your return, God bless you,"" says the deputy minister. ""Looking forward to my return?"" replies Turki. ""What about the letters your officers send me? 'You son of a whore, we'll drag you back like Sultan bin Turki.'"" The deputy minister replies reassuringly: ""They won't touch you. I'm your brother."" ""No they're from you,"" says Turki. ""The Ministry of Interior sends them."" Turki went on publishing videos until July 2015. Then, sometime later that year, he disappeared. ""He called me every month or two,"" says a friend, the blogger and activist Wael al-Khalaf. ""Then he disappeared for four or five months. I was suspicious. [Then] I heard from a senior officer in the kingdom that Turki bin Bandar was with them. So they'd taken him, he'd been kidnapped."" After a long search for news of Turki, I found an article in a Moroccan newspaper, which said that he had been about to return to France after a visit to Morocco, when he was arrested and jailed. Then, following a request from the Saudi authorities, he was deported with the approval of a Moroccan court. We don't know for certain what happened  to Turki bin Bandar, but before he disappeared he gave his friend Wael a copy of a book he'd written, in which he had added what may be a prophetic note. ""Dear Wael, these statements are not to be shared unless I am kidnapped or assassinated. I know I will be kidnapped or they will assassinate me. I also know how they abuse my rights and those of the Saudi people."" Saud bin Saif al-Nasr Around the same time as Prince Turki vanished another Saudi prince, Saud bin Saif al-Nasr - a relatively minor royal with a liking for Europe's casinos and expensive hotels - shared a similar fate. In 2014 Saud began writing tweets that were critical of the Saudi monarchy. He called for the prosecution of Saudi officials who'd backed the overthrow of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi the previous year. Then, in September 2015, Saud went further. After an anonymous Saudi prince wrote two letters calling for a coup to remove King Salman, Saud publicly endorsed them - the only royal to do so. This was tantamount to treason, and may have sealed his fate. A few days later, he tweeted: ""I call for the nation to turn the content of these letters into popular pressure."" Then his Twitter account went silent. Another dissident prince - Prince Khaled bin Farhan, who fled to Germany in 2013 - believes Saud was tricked into flying from Milan to Rome to discuss a business deal with a Russian-Italian company seeking to open branches in the Gulf. ""A private plane from the company came and took Prince Saud. But it didn't land in Rome, it landed in Riyadh,"" Khaled says. ""It turned out Saudi intelligence had fabricated the entire operation,"" he claims. ""Now Prince Saud's fate is the same as Prince Turki's, which is prisonâ¦ The only fate is an underground prison."" Kidnapped: Saudi Arabia's Missing Princeswill be broadcast on BBC Arabic on Tuesday 15 August at 19:05 GMT and repeated on 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 August The film was also broadcast on BBC Newsnight on Monday 14 August.Watch it here Prince Sultan, being higher up the royal pecking order, was shuttled between prison and house arrest. But his health was also deteriorating, so in 2010 the royal family allowed him to seek medical treatment in Boston, Massachusetts. What he did from the safety of his US exile must have horrified the Saudis - he filed a criminal complaint in the Swiss courts, accusing Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd and Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh of responsibility for his 2003 kidnap. His American lawyer, Clyde Bergstresser, obtained a medical record from King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, where Sultan was admitted on 13 June 2003, which indicated that a tube had been placed into his mouth to help him breathe while anaesthetised, and that one side of his diaphragm was paralysed - presumably as a result of the assault. For the first time a senior Saudi royal was launching a criminal complaint, in a Western court, against another family member. But Bergstresser says the Swiss authorities have shown little interest in the case. ""Nothing has been done to pursue what occurred at the airport,"" he says. ""Who were the pilots? What were the flight plans when these planes from Saudi Arabia arrived? This abduction occurred on Swiss soil and one would think that there would be an interest in finding out how that occurred."" In January 2016, Sultan was staying at an exclusive Paris hotel when, like Saud bin Saif al-Nasr, he was tempted on to an aeroplane. He was planning to visit his father, also a well-known critic of the Saudi government, in Cairo, when the Saudi consulate offered him and his entourage of about 18 - including a personal doctor and nurses and bodyguards from the US and Europe - the use of a private jet. Despite what had happened to him in 2003, he accepted. Two members of the entourage explain how events unfolded. Both prefer to remain anonymous. ""We pulled on to the tarmac and in front of us was a huge airplane, with... it had the country of Saudi Arabia written on it,"" says one. ""It was a little eerie because there were a lot of crew members on board. All of them were male,"" says the other. The plane took off with in-flight monitors showing it was bound for Cairo. But two-and-a-half hours into the flight, the monitors went blank. Prince Sultan was sleeping in his room, but he woke up about an hour before landing. He looked out of the window, and appeared anxious, the former members of his staff say. As it dawned on the passengers that they were about to land in Saudi Arabia, Sultan started banging on the cockpit door and crying for help. A crew member ordered the prince's team to stay in their seats. ""We looked out the window and we just saw a bunch of people get out with their rifles slung over their chest and surrounded the plane,"" says one of the members of his entourage. The soldiers and cabin crew dragged Sultan from the plane. He was screaming at his team to call the US embassy. The prince and his medics were taken to a villa and put under armed guard. On the plane the others waited nervously. They were later taken to a hotel, held for three days without passports or telephones, then allowed to fly to a destination of their choice. Before they left, a Saudi official, who the prince's staff recognised as one of the ""flight attendants"" on the plane, offered an apology. ""He told us that we were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that he was sorry for the inconvenience,"" one of them says. The other adds: ""I wasn't inconvenienced - I was kidnapped. I was held against my will in a country that I did not choose to go to."" It was an astonishing situation. Together with Prince Sultan, about 18 foreign nationals had been kidnapped, taken to Saudi Arabia, and held by the Saudi military. There has been no news of Prince Sultan since these events. I asked the government of Saudi Arabia to respond to the allegations in this film. It declined to comment. Prince Khaled Meanwhile Prince Khaled, still exiled in Germany, worries that he too will be forced to return to Riyadh. ""There were four of us family members in Europe. We criticised the family and its rule in Saudi Arabia. Three of us were kidnapped. I'm the only one left,"" he says. Could he be next on the abduction list? ""I'm convinced. I've been convinced for a long time. If they could do it, they'd have done it by now. I'm very cautious, but it's at the price of my freedom."" Update, October 2018: Two months after this story was published the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Fasial, confirmed that all three missing princes were back in Saudi Arabia. Prince Khaled bin Farhan, meanwhile, says he has heard from sources inside the country that Prince Turki bin Bandar and Saud bin Saif al-Nasr have both been executed. This could not be independently confirmed. Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"North Korean state media released photos of Kim Jong-un apparently reviewing military documents North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reviewed plans to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam but will hold off, state media said. Although prepared for ""the enveloping fire at Guam"", the North said it would watch what ""the foolish Yankees"" do before taking a decision. Last week's threat against Guam escalated the sharp rhetoric being exchanged between the two sides. This latest report points to a pause in the increasingly bitter war of words. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in meanwhile has urged the US not to launch an attack on the Korean peninsula without its consent, saying ""no-one may decide to take military action without the consent"" of the South. In a separate incident in Guam, an emergency alert was broadcast in error on a radio station warning residents of ""civil danger"" on the island. The Guam Homeland Security Office said the alert, which went out shortly after midnight on Tuesday, was a result of human error and would not happen again. In astatement posted on Facebook,external, the office said that the broadcast was ""an unscheduled test"" and urged both residents and visitors to ""remain calm"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? What could North Korea do? North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war The report on state news agency KCNA said Kim Jong-un ""examined the plan for a long time"" and discussed it with senior military officials. The commander of North Korea's strategic force was now merely waiting for orders ""after rounding off the preparations for the enveloping fire at Guam"". But, crucially, the report also said that Mr Kim would watch the US before making any decision, signalling an apparent deceleration in the provocative rhetoric. Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Correspondents say that after days of menacing threats it might seem that Kim Jong-un could be in the mood to finally hit the pause button -  but in a nation as secretive as North Korea, one can never be sure. Analysts say it could simply mean Pyongyang is not fully ready to launch an attack on Guam, so it could just be buying more time. South Korea and China - North Korea's closest ally - have been urging calm and a renewed push for diplomatic resolutions. On Tuesday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the US should not act unilaterally. The two countries'defence agreement,externalstates that they must ""consult together"" when either is threatened. Questions are being raised about whether America would need South Korea's approval to strike back at North Korea if Guam was attacked. According to international law, and the military agreement between South Korea and the US, it does not. So why would President Moon say no military action could be taken without Seoul's ""consent""? Professor Hwee Rhak Park from Kookmin University says it might be a gesture towards liberals in South Korea - who are the president's main supporters - to show that the government is in control of the situation. South Korea is often criticised by its northern neighbour for being a puppet of the US, so this could also be a veiled message to America to tone down the rhetoric. Whatever he means, the South Korean president's stance has been quite clear from the start. He wants a diplomatic resolution, and has reiterated that he's open to talks with Pyongyang.

He also sought to reassure residents of Guam, home to US military bases and about 160,000 people, that they were well-protected and if a missile was fired, ""we'll take it out"". It comes after President Trump threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"", saying: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded.""

That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more.

Guam profile from BBC Monitoring Over the past year North Korea has stepped up its missile tests, despite repeated warnings from all quarters. The state had already conducted five nuclear tests, but then in July it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) claiming it now had the ability to hit the US mainland. The UN then approved fresh economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The measures aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third.

Last week, US media reported that North Korea had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.
