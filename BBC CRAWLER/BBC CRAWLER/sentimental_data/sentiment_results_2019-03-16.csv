"This video can not be played Victim's brother: ""No words to describe the pain"" The brother of a Pakistani man who was killed during Friday's twin mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, has told the BBC of his pride and pain. Khursheed Alam said he was proud his brother, who was killed alongside his son, had tried to tackle the gunman. ""I wish I could die like him,"" he said. Fifty people are now known to have died with another 50 injured. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, live-streamed the attack on Facebook. He has been charged with one count of murder. On Saturday, he appeared in court in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. Further charges are expected to be levelled against him. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns. ""Our gun laws will change,"" she added. How attacks unfolded The victims and missing He has been remanded in custody without a plea and is due to appear in court again on 5 April. Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder The presiding judge ruled that the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs and filming to preserve his fair trial rights. Two others are in custody, but police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. One had gone to help armed with a gun - and has been charged with firearms offences, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. An 18-year-old was also arrested but his involvement was said to be ""tangential"" and he would appear in court on Monday, he added. None of those detained had a criminal record. Fifty people are known to have been injured - two remain in a critical condition, said the police commissioner. Naeem Rashid, 50, and his 21-year-old son Talha had been living in New Zealand since 2010. Mr Rashid has been hailed as a hero on social media after being seen in a video of the attacks apparently trying to tackle the gunman at Al Noor mosque before being shot. His brother, in the northern Pakistani city of Abbottabad, told the BBC's Secunder Kermani he was proud of his actions. ""He was a brave person,"" Mr Alam said. ""I've heard from people there... there were a few witnesses who said he saved a few lives by trying to stop that guy."" But he went to add that even though his brother was being hailed as a hero by some people, it was ""still a shock for us"". ""It's our pride now, but still the loss - it's like cutting your limb off really."" This video can not be played Ali Adeeba: ""He (his father) is the one that actually took a bullet for me"" Mr Alam said he was angry. ""Terrorists don't have a religion,"" he said, adding ""crazy people"" had to be stopped. At the other mosque attacked, in Linwood, a similar intervention occurred. Abdul Aziz says he ran towards the gunman outside the mosque, throwing a credit card machine at him. In the ensuing chase, the gunman dropped one of his weapons and went to fetch more from his car, when Mr Aziz tossed the gun towards him, smashing the car window. The gunman then drove off and was arrested moments later. Officials in New Zealand are now carrying out the difficult task of identifying those who died. They have shared a list of victims with families, but not released it publicly. Omar Nabi holds a phone with a picture of his father Daoud outside the court building Some of the other victims were: Sayyad Milne, 14, who wanted to be a footballer when he grew up Daoud Nabi, 71, who is believed to have thrown himself in front of other people in the mosque to protect them Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Hosne Ara, 42, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch during Friday prayers at 13:40 (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. He fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. More about the suspects Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Social media's role in attack The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. Ms Ardern said the guns used by the attacker appeared to have been modified, and that the suspect's car was full of weapons, suggesting ""his intention to continue with his attack"". He had obtained a gun licence in November 2017 that allowed him to buy the weapons used in the attack. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: NZ ""gun laws will change... now is the time"" New Zealand's Attorney General David Parker said the government would look into banning semi-automatic weapons, but that no final decision had been made. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws in a country with a strong gun lobby and culture of hunting have failed. What are New Zealand's gun laws? The suspect had not been on the radar of security services in New Zealand or Australia. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Christchurch All day on Saturday, the people of Christchurch turned out to show their rejection of the hate that inspired Friday's horrific attacks. At one point a group of young men started quietly singing a traditional Maori song, their heads bowed, eyes closed. This video can not be played Linwood imam: We still love this country The mayor of Christchurch said the killer had come to the city with hate in his heart, to perform an act of terrorism. But she said he did not represent anything about the city. Still, there are lots of uncomfortable questions for the authorities here. The man now in custody, Brenton Tarrant, made no secret of his support for white supremacy. He had reportedly been planning the attacks for months. And yet he was not on any police watch list. He did not have any trouble getting a gun licence, nor in buying a collection of high-powered weapons. A silver fern projected on to the Sydney Opera House in commemoration of the victims Before the attacks, social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The text is called The Great Replacement, a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. The man said he had begun planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The suspect sent the document to 70 people,external, including to Ms Ardern's generic address, less than 10 minutes before the attack, the New Zealand Herald reports. Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million, according to the latest census figures. Numbers have risen sharply since the 1990s as the country took in refugees from various war-torn countries.

"This video can not be played Christchurch shootings: Flowers and Haka in tribute The man charged over Friday's twin mosque attacks in the New Zealand city of Christchurch is believed to have acted alone, police say. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, live-streamed the attack on Facebook. Three others arrested afterwards are not believed to have been involved, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Tributes have been paid for the 50 victims while the first bodies are expected to be released for burial. About 34 people are in hospital receiving treatment for injuries including severe gunshot wounds. A four-year-old girl remains in a critical condition. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her cabinet would discuss issues including gun policy reform on Monday, repeating that there would be ""changes to our gun laws"". Speaking to reporters on Sunday, she said parliament on Tuesday would pay tribute to victims of what she described as an ""act of terror"" and that she expected the bodies of all those killed to be returned to their families by Wednesday. This video can not be played New Zealand gun laws will change, says PM Ms Ardern also said there were ""further questions to be answered"" about the role of social media sites such as Facebook, which was used to broadcast live footage of the attacks. She said these platforms had ""a wide reach"" and this was ""a problem that goes way beyond New Zealand"". Who were the victims? 'Too painful': Christchurch responds to attacks Social media's role in attack Facebook said it had removed as many as 1.5 million videos,externalof the attack from its site in the first 24 hours and that ""all edited versions of the video that do not show graphic content"" were also being deleted. Ms Ardern confirmed that her office had received a document from the suspect nine minutes before the attacks but that it did not contain any specific details, such as a location. She said it was forwarded to the security services within two minutes. Separately, Commissioner Bush said authorities were working as fast as they could to finish formally identifying the victims of the attacks at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques. It was a sensitive process and that he was ""aware of the cultural and religious needs"". The main suspect appeared in court on Saturday in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. He has been charged with one count of murder with more charges expected to follow. Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns, Ms Ardern said. He did not have a criminal record and had not been on the radar of security services in New Zealand or Australia.

"Ms Fadil was writing a book about her experiences A murder investigation is under way in Italy after the death of a Moroccan model who testified against former PM Silvio Berlusconi in 2012. Imane Fadil, 33, died on 1 March in a Milan hospital, a month after being admitted with stomach pains. At the time she said she had been poisoned. Italian media say she may have been poisoned with a radioactive substance. She was a key witness against Mr Berlusconi, who was accused of paying for sex with an underage prostitute. The many trials of Berlusconi Mr Berlusconi, 82, was initially convicted but then acquitted on appeal. He was later convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to carry out community service. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Berlusconi said: ""It's always a pity when a young person dies. I never met this person, never talked to her. ""What I read of her statements made me think that everything was invented, absurd,"" he said. Mr Berlusconi - who has served as prime minister in four governments - is still facing a number of charges, including bribery. He denies the allegations. Milan chief prosecutor Francesco Greco told Reuters news agency there were ""several anomalies"" in Ms Fadil's medical records. ""The doctors have not identified with any certainty any pathology which can explain the death,"" he said. Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reported that Milan's hospital had sent samples to a specialist laboratory. The results suggested the presence of a mix of radioactive substances, including cobalt. This has not been confirmed by Italian prosecutors. Italian media also report that Ms Fadil - a regular guest at Mr Berlusconi's sex parties - was writing a book about her experiences, and magistrates investigating her death have obtained a copy of the manuscript. Mr Berlusconi's reputation was tarnished by allegations about the parties at his private villa. Both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug denied they had sex In October 2010, it emerged that Mr Berlusconi had called a police station asking for the release of a 17-year-old girl, Karima ""Ruby"" El Mahroug. She was being held for theft and was also said to have attended his so-called ""bunga-bunga"" parties. An explanation of bunga bunga In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying her for sex, and of abuse of power.The case was eventually overturned in 2014. Mr Berlusconi has always maintained he is ""no saint"" but firmly rejects claims he has ever paid for sex with a woman, saying: ""I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest.""

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable at party conference The Liberal Democrats are on a mission to go from ""protest back to power"", the party's departing leader, Sir Vince Cable, has said. In a speech in York, Sir Vince called for the party to continue arguing for the benefits of staying in the EU. He also accused Prime Minister Theresa May of prioritising Conservative Party unity over maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Sir Vince, 75, will step down in May after leading the Lib Dems since 2017. What next for the Lib Dems? Cable to quit as Lib Dem leader in May Speaking on Sunday at the party's spring conference, Sir Vince said ""we are Remain"", adding: ""Whatever happens in the next few weeks of parliamentary twists and turns, we must argue - since no-one else can be relied upon to do so - that none of the several mutually exclusive versions of Brexit on offer - soft or hard - are as good as the deal we currently have."" Next week, Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons for a third time after it was twice voted down by large margins. Mrs May's efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics to back the deal have focused on attempts to revise the backstop, the measures in the Brexit deal aimed at preventing the return of a hard border in Ireland. ""The intensity of the campaign to remove it speaks volumes about the underlying motives of those who demanded Brexit and now demand a 'clear Brexit',"" Sir Vince said. ""They simply deny our history, which is entwined with that of Ireland."" Jo Swinson, deputy leader since 2017, is one of the leading contenders to be the next leader Sir Vince also targeted Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley personally for criticism, following a series of gaffes. Ms Bradley previously said that deaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland during the Troubles were ""not crimes"" - comments sheended up apologising for. She also admitted toinitially not understanding that nationalists did not vote for unionist parties during elections. ""It really is quite shocking that this government is so lacking in talent that it employs a secretary of state for Northern Ireland who says she doesn't understand sectarian voting patterns and then compounds this public declaration of ignorance with a blatantly and naively one-sided view of the killings in the Troubles,"" Sir Vince said. ""Ms Bradley has revealed an ugly truth: that peace in Ireland matters less than peace in the Conservative Party."" Sir Vince will step down in May Sir Vince, who clashed repeatedly with Mrs May over immigration policy while they sat around the Cabinet table during the coalition years, used his speech to return to the issue, saying it highlights a divide in British politics. ""Our mission to move from survival to success, from protest back to power, takes place in a world where liberal values are under siege and in retreat. ""Nothing quite defines liberalism like its opposite, illustrated by Theresa May's policies on immigration."" The Lib Dems have 11 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. Sir Vince, a former business secretary under the Coalition government, will step down after the English local elections in May. Leading candidates to replace him include the current deputy leader, Jo Swinson, relative newcomer Layla Moran and former environment secretary Ed Davey. What next for the Lib Dems?

"This video can not be played Protesters in Paris lit fires and vandalised buildings as violence flared once more Demonstrators have smashed and looted shops in Paris in a resurgence of the gilets jaunes (""yellow vest"") protests that started four months ago in France. Rioters torched a luxury handbag store and vandalised an upscale restaurant on the famed Champs-ÃlysÃ©es avenue. Police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters. More than 120 people were arrested. The protests began over fuel tax rises but have since developed into a broader revolt against perceived elitism. Police say about 10,000 people took part in Saturday's protest in the French capital, a marked increase compared with similar demonstrations in recent weeks. Some 32,300 in total took to the streets throughout France, according to the Interior Ministry. Who are the 'gilets jaunes' protests? The story of the gilet jaunes However, police said 36,000 people took part peacefully in a separate march against climate change in another part of Paris. Protesters threw cobblestones at police at the Arc de Triomphe war memorial. As well as a surge in numbers on Saturday, there was a return to the levels of violence that characterised the early protests. A fire burns on the Champs-Elysees in Paris during Saturday's protests The high-end Fouquet's restaurant was torched More than 120 people were arrested in Paris Fouquet's - an upscale restaurant popular with politicians and celebrities - was vandalised, as was a Boss menswear store. Rioters also set fire to the luxury Longchamp handbag store. Fires were lit in the streets, with at least one car set ablaze, and a bank branch was set alight. The bank was located on the ground floor of an apartment building, which was engulfed by flames. The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, a spokesman told the AFP news agency. French frustrations boil over in angry debates Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that more than 1,400 police officers had been mobilised. Mr Castaner said he had given police an order to respond to the ""unacceptable attacks with the greatest firmness"". Writing on Twitter, he said: ""Let there be no doubt: they are looking for violence and are there to sow chaos in Paris."" By mid-afternoon, 129 people were arrested, AFP reports. Demonstrators throw cobblestones at police during clashes near the Arc de Triomphe In January, the government ordered police to crack down on violence in the protests, leading to complaints of police brutality. President Emmanuel Macron offered concessions to the protesters after the movement swept the nation - including â¬10bn (Â£8.5bn; $11bn) designed to boost the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners - but they failed to quell the discontent. For the past month, Mr Macron has toured France, listening to local mayors and citizens as part of his ""grand dÃ©bat"" - a big national debate. He has also asked communities to come together and put forward their ideas for how to fix France, and there have so far been 8,253 local meetings. The yellow vest movement has faced accusations of anti-Semitism in recent weeks after a prominent Jewish philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut, was targeted by insults and taunts in Paris. Officers in Paris intervened to form a barrier after a group of individuals involved in the march confronted Mr Finkielkraut and started verbally insulting him. Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? The 69-year-old academic told Le Parisien newspaper that he heard people shouting ""dirty Zionist"" and ""throw yourself in the canal"". A few days before Mr Finkielkraut was attacked, official data suggested there had been a 74% rise in anti-Semitic attacks in France last year.

"Tory MP Nick Boles is resigning from his local Conservative association after clashing with them over Brexit. Mr Boles, who wants to remain as MP for Grantham and Stamford, has spoken out about leaving the EU with no deal. Local activists had wanted to deselect him as their candidate in the next general election because of his stance. In his letter, seen by the BBC, he said he was resigning with immediate effect and that a ""division had opened up"" between him and the local association. A simple guide to Brexit What happened this week? And what happens now? He wrote: ""I regret that my relationship with you should end in this way. But a politician without principles is worthless.

He wrote: ""As you are all aware, Nick has been at odds with the local party and the prime minister for some time, so this announcement does not come as a complete surprise, but the timing does leave a lot to be desired."" He said the process of selecting a new candidate would start at the group's AGM later this month. Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles was a ""valued member of the Conservative parliamentary party which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive"". His announcement comes after a busy week in Westminster, whenMPs voted to seek a delayto the UK's departure from the EU, due to take place on 29 March. The third ""meaningful vote"" on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is expected to take place next week. If it is agreed, she has promised to seek a short extension to the departure date.

Mr Boles said he was ""proud"" of his role in the cross-party campaign to force Mrs May to request an extension to Article 50 beyond 29 March and block a no-deal Brexit.

Mr Farage aims to walk 100 of the 270-mile March to Leave, which is due to arrive in the capital on 29 March. Separately, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said politicians will move ""heaven and earth"" to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. Speaking before an event in Gravesend, Kent, Mr McDonnell said ""quite a number"" of MPs would be prepared to support a compromise deal, with the guarantee the deal goes back to the people for a final say on Brexit.

"New Zealand police guard one of the Christchurch mosques where people were killed A man has been arrested in the UK on suspicion of making a malicious social media post about the attacks that killed 49 people at mosques in New Zealand. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the post was ""making reference and support for the terrible events"". The arrested man is a 24-year old from Oldham. GMP said where ""people cross the line, we will take robust action, which may include arrest and prosecution"". The force said: ""This is a very difficult time for people.

"The problem for any novelist choosing rock'n'roll as a subject for a book is how to make their fiction stranger - and more compelling - than the truth. What can they say or reveal that hasn't been said and revealed in half-a-century of tell-all sex-and-drugs-and-rock-and-roll memoirs, from Stephen Davis's snorts-and-all biography of Led Zeppelin, Hammer of the Gods, to Keith Richards' magnificent memoir, Life? It is not an easy task. Don DeLillo did a good job in 1973 with Great Jones Street, and John Niven's dark satire Kill Your Friends is a terrific take-down of the music business. And there's Roddy Doyle's The Commitments and Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad. All succeed. But they represent the occasional one-hit wonder in a literary genre piled high with non-charting flops. The American author Taylor Jenkins Reid is the latest writer to enter the unforgiving mosh-pit that is pop fiction with her Flower-Power era novel Daisy Jones & The Six. The story starts in the mid-60s when Daisy Jones is a 14-year-old only child living with her distant but wealthy parents in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She decides to make her own fun, which involves hanging out in clubs on Sunset Strip, taking drugs, and having lots of sex. The famous Whisky A Go Go night club on Sunset Strip in LA, where Daisy Jones dreams of performing Meanwhile, over in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Billy Dunne and his brother Graham form a teenage band with three other local lads. They do okay, hire a keyboard player called Karen, become The Six and move to LA, where in due course, they hook up with the naturally gifted but constantly strung-out Miss Jones. The book is written as an oral history with each band member and associate (managers, partners, producers etc) giving their side of the story with recollections that often differ: Graham:""Billy was always in charge, you know? Billy wrote the lyrics, Billy composed and arranged all of the songs. If Billy goes to rehab the tour is over. If Billy is ready to go back to the studio, we all have to report for duty. He ran the show."" Billy:""We were all a team."" It reads like you're watching one of those low-budget TV documentaries where a bunch of people of whom you've largely never heard, recollect a culturally important past event in which they were involved. It doesn't make for the best telly, and nor does it make irresistible readingâ¦ for the first 80 pages. Thereafter, as you are drawn further and further into the bell-bottomed, drug-addled, band-on-a-verge-of-a-breakthrough world of Daisy Jones & The Six, it's like their first album: a real grower. So much so, in fact, there will be occasions when you find yourself unconsciously reaching for a mobile device to hear one of the band's songs. That is a mark of how effective Taylor Jenkins Reid's structural device is most of the time, although there are moments when the documentary realism falters and the novel slips into a slightly trite 1970s pastiche. But those moments are as rare as Daisy & The Six turning in a duff performance as they make their way from wannabes to chart-topping superstars. The author draws you into believing in the fictional superstars' success story Taylor Jenkins Reid began her career in film production, before turning to writing novels It is a much-told fable, of course, which is saved from being a hackneyed re-hash by the quality of the writing. The characters are well drawn, idiosyncratic, and believable. Their actions and opinions make sense. That authenticity extends to the passages in which the songs are written, which not only ring true in terms of the creative process but also in the lyrics, which genuinely capture the Fleetwood Mac vibe, the band appears to be based upon. Taylor Jenkins Reid says when she decided to write a book about rock 'n' roll, she remembered seeing a moment of ""love"" between Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham There is one other aspect to this novel that takes it away from the cheesy end of the market and gives it a life beyond another faux rock doc with a dim drummer. At its heart Daisy Jones & The Six is a well observed, sensitively told love story. Not a simple tale of lost and found or found and lost. But a messier exploration of what love is, what it costs, and how a life lived without it, looks. Admittedly, it is not a great literary masterpiece, but it is a great read. And given the way it has been written, which feels more like a script than a novel, it is no surprise that Reese Witherspoon bought the rights and was subsequently commissioned by Amazon to turn it into a TV series complete with soundtrack. I, for one, will be watching.

"This video can not be played Lauren's attempts to create brain tingles has attracted 125,000 subscribers In Lauren's most popular ASMR video she ""role-plays"" a hairdresser, inviting the viewer to relax as she pretends to trim their beard. ""If you are a girl, it is OK to imagine you have a big beard,"" she says. Why would a video of someone acting out cutting an imaginary beard be watched 700,000 times? Lauren, whose YouTube channel is called Scottish Murmurs, says it is because of the up-close personal attention she gives and the sounds she creates such as the click of the scissors or the squelch of the shaving cream. Hairbrushing is one of the ASMR role-plays Lauren does ""People find the video really tingly,"" she tellsBBC Scotland's The Nine. This brain tingle sensation is the hallmark of ASMR videos, a YouTube subgenre that continues to grow massively. The initials stand for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, which sounds like a vaguely scientific term but the name actually appears to have been coined by people in the scene. It also sounds quite sexual but Lauren is adamant that is not the case. Instead, she says it helps people to relax, to clear their mind before sleep or even to cope with anxiety or mental health issues. A recent study by Sheffield University appears to back that up, suggesting it may have physiological benefits,external. Rapper Cardi B released an ASMR video last year In October,superstar rapper Cardi B released an ASMR video,external, signalling how popular the genre has become. And during last month's Super Bowl an advert featured Big Little Lies actress Zoe Kravitz whispering and tapping on a beer bottle, presumably with the intention of giving shivers of delight to viewers. Big Little Lies actress Zoe Kravitz starred in a Superbowl advert The term is believed to have been coined by American Jennifer Allen, who started a Facebook group on the topic in 2010. It is a physical sensation in response to specific sights and sounds. Lauren describes the tingles generated by the videos as ""the shiveries"", a frisson that travels from the top of the head down the spine and can be caused by numerous different triggers. There are more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube including subjects such as people having haircuts, massages and towel-folding tutorials. Lauren, from Glasgow, has been posting to her Scottish Murmurs channel for about two-and-a-half years and has 125,000 subscribers. Her 200 videos have been watched about 25 million times in total. The 24-year-old says she makes money from the channel but nowhere near as much as the big stars who earn hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. They whisper, tap their fingers, make ""mouth sounds"" or act out role-play scenarios such as a doctor's appointment or a visit to the hairdresser's, all with the aim of engendering the ""shiveries"". Lauren likes to make the role-play videos in which she can use her acting skills as well as her creativity in making the trigger sounds. She uses hi-tech binaural microphones to create a 3D audio experience that makes the listener feel they are in the middle of the scene. Lauren says she first got into ASMR at university. ""I'm one of those people who cannot study in silence,"" she says. ""I need to listen to music or something in the background."" ""At first I found it a bit weird, the whispering felt a bit odd, but I kept listening and I found I was getting tingles and I was feeling relaxed."" Towards the end of her time at university she decided to try to make her own ASMR videos. Her Scottish accent was instantly popular. ""A lot of people find it really relaxing, especially over in America,"" Lauren says. ""A really common comment is the way we say ""girl"", they really like the sound of that word."" She also does a series of parody videos where she lays the Scottish accent on thick and speaks like a granny. ""It's got that motherly vibe to it that people find relaxing,"" she says. Whispering, role-playing, massages, creams, rubber gloves, mouth sounds and the clicking of the tongue are all popular ways of triggering that brain tingle or ""head orgasm"" as some have described it. But Lauren denies there is any sexual element. ""A lot of the ASMR videos are whispering and sometimes people assume it is sexual,"" she says. She likens it to yoga, the poses of which can be considered sexual and provocative. ""If you take it out of context you could make it sexual but actually ASMR itself, the tingling, the videos on YouTube, are not,"" she says. According to Lauren, her purpose is to help people relax and deal with the stresses of everyday life. Her cousin killed herself a couple of years ago and that brought home to her the struggles people have with mental health. ""A lot of people use ASMR to help them when they are feeling lonely or anxious,"" she says. ""I have had emails from all sorts of people explaining how much my videos have helped them.""

By the end of the broadcast, more than Â£63m had been raised. The last Red Nose Day, two years ago, raised Â£71.3m by the end of the evening. This year's Red Nose Day telethon also saw a dip in ratings, with an average of 5.6 million people tuning in - 600,000 fewer viewers compared to 2017. The highest amount the event has raised so far was Â£108.4m in 2011, once all the pledges had been redeemed. Half the money raised from Comic Relief goes to causes in the UK and half to those around the world. The fundraising TV show also featured an appearance from Little Mix - who looked less than impressed when former shadow chancellor Ed Balls had a go at singing one of their biggest hits, Shout Out To My Ex. The chart-topping band and the Strictly Come Dancing favourite were among a number of celebrities who climbed Africa's highest mountain Kilimanjaro to raise more than Â£2m towards the show's final total.

"The man was in the back bedroom when the tree fell down at about 07:30 GMT and caused him a minor head injury A man has been hurt by a large oak tree that crashed on to the roof of a two-storey house in high winds. A branch from the mature tree drove into one of the windows of the family home in Chetwood Road, near Crawley, where a couple and their child live. West Sussex Fire and Rescue said a man suffered a non-serious head injury. Neighbour Jeremy Clayden said he heard an ""almighty crash"" at about 07:30 GMT and said he was shocked by the extent of the damage to the first floor. The couple and their child are currently staying with neighbours. Another home nearby was also evacuated. The man was in the back bedroom when the tree came down. He was treated at the scene by South East Coast Ambulance Service. Mr Clayden,  a property surveyor, said: ""I've seen some things in my time, but never a tree of this size fall on to the back of a house. ""There had been very strong winds here before it fell. A tree surgeon and building control officer were called to the scene ""The damage is extensive, the entire rear left side of the house on the first floor is demolished and the flank wall is now bowing and most likely structurally unstable. ""It will be a big job to fix, it's no easy task just moving the tree."" West Sussex Fire and Rescue service said crews were still at the scene and the road, as well as nearby Howard Road, had been cordoned off. A building control officer is due to formally check the integrity of the building. West Sussex County Council Turn Blue Monday Orange at Littlehampton Wave!

"The problem for any novelist choosing rock'n'roll as a subject for a book is how to make their fiction stranger - and more compelling - than the truth. What can they say or reveal that hasn't been said and revealed in half-a-century of tell-all sex-and-drugs-and-rock-and-roll memoirs, from Stephen Davis's snorts-and-all biography of Led Zeppelin, Hammer of the Gods, to Keith Richards' magnificent memoir, Life? It is not an easy task. Don DeLillo did a good job in 1973 with Great Jones Street, and John Niven's dark satire Kill Your Friends is a terrific take-down of the music business. And there's Roddy Doyle's The Commitments and Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad. All succeed. But they represent the occasional one-hit wonder in a literary genre piled high with non-charting flops. The American author Taylor Jenkins Reid is the latest writer to enter the unforgiving mosh-pit that is pop fiction with her Flower-Power era novel Daisy Jones & The Six. The story starts in the mid-60s when Daisy Jones is a 14-year-old only child living with her distant but wealthy parents in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She decides to make her own fun, which involves hanging out in clubs on Sunset Strip, taking drugs, and having lots of sex. The famous Whisky A Go Go night club on Sunset Strip in LA, where Daisy Jones dreams of performing Meanwhile, over in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Billy Dunne and his brother Graham form a teenage band with three other local lads. They do okay, hire a keyboard player called Karen, become The Six and move to LA, where in due course, they hook up with the naturally gifted but constantly strung-out Miss Jones. The book is written as an oral history with each band member and associate (managers, partners, producers etc) giving their side of the story with recollections that often differ: Graham:""Billy was always in charge, you know? Billy wrote the lyrics, Billy composed and arranged all of the songs. If Billy goes to rehab the tour is over. If Billy is ready to go back to the studio, we all have to report for duty. He ran the show."" Billy:""We were all a team."" It reads like you're watching one of those low-budget TV documentaries where a bunch of people of whom you've largely never heard, recollect a culturally important past event in which they were involved. It doesn't make for the best telly, and nor does it make irresistible readingâ¦ for the first 80 pages. Thereafter, as you are drawn further and further into the bell-bottomed, drug-addled, band-on-a-verge-of-a-breakthrough world of Daisy Jones & The Six, it's like their first album: a real grower. So much so, in fact, there will be occasions when you find yourself unconsciously reaching for a mobile device to hear one of the band's songs. That is a mark of how effective Taylor Jenkins Reid's structural device is most of the time, although there are moments when the documentary realism falters and the novel slips into a slightly trite 1970s pastiche. But those moments are as rare as Daisy & The Six turning in a duff performance as they make their way from wannabes to chart-topping superstars. The author draws you into believing in the fictional superstars' success story Taylor Jenkins Reid began her career in film production, before turning to writing novels It is a much-told fable, of course, which is saved from being a hackneyed re-hash by the quality of the writing. The characters are well drawn, idiosyncratic, and believable. Their actions and opinions make sense. That authenticity extends to the passages in which the songs are written, which not only ring true in terms of the creative process but also in the lyrics, which genuinely capture the Fleetwood Mac vibe, the band appears to be based upon. Taylor Jenkins Reid says when she decided to write a book about rock 'n' roll, she remembered seeing a moment of ""love"" between Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham There is one other aspect to this novel that takes it away from the cheesy end of the market and gives it a life beyond another faux rock doc with a dim drummer. At its heart Daisy Jones & The Six is a well observed, sensitively told love story. Not a simple tale of lost and found or found and lost. But a messier exploration of what love is, what it costs, and how a life lived without it, looks. Admittedly, it is not a great literary masterpiece, but it is a great read. And given the way it has been written, which feels more like a script than a novel, it is no surprise that Reese Witherspoon bought the rights and was subsequently commissioned by Amazon to turn it into a TV series complete with soundtrack. I, for one, will be watching. Reese Witherspoon will co-produce a 13-part TV series based on the book, commissioned by Amazon Studios Captain Marvel starring Oscar-winning Brie Larson âââââ All the Rembrandts at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam âââââ Only Fools and Horses The Musical âââââ Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter,external New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Protesters in Paris lit fires and vandalised buildings as violence flared once more Demonstrators have smashed and looted shops in Paris in a resurgence of the gilets jaunes (""yellow vest"") protests that started four months ago in France. Rioters torched a luxury handbag store and vandalised an upscale restaurant on the famed Champs-ÃlysÃ©es avenue. Police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters. More than 120 people were arrested. The protests began over fuel tax rises but have since developed into a broader revolt against perceived elitism. Police say about 10,000 people took part in Saturday's protest in the French capital, a marked increase compared with similar demonstrations in recent weeks. Some 32,300 in total took to the streets throughout France, according to the Interior Ministry. Who are the 'gilets jaunes' protests? The story of the gilet jaunes However, police said 36,000 people took part peacefully in a separate march against climate change in another part of Paris. Protesters threw cobblestones at police at the Arc de Triomphe war memorial. As well as a surge in numbers on Saturday, there was a return to the levels of violence that characterised the early protests. A fire burns on the Champs-Elysees in Paris during Saturday's protests The high-end Fouquet's restaurant was torched More than 120 people were arrested in Paris Fouquet's - an upscale restaurant popular with politicians and celebrities - was vandalised, as was a Boss menswear store. Rioters also set fire to the luxury Longchamp handbag store. Fires were lit in the streets, with at least one car set ablaze, and a bank branch was set alight. The bank was located on the ground floor of an apartment building, which was engulfed by flames. The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, a spokesman told the AFP news agency. French frustrations boil over in angry debates Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that more than 1,400 police officers had been mobilised. Mr Castaner said he had given police an order to respond to the ""unacceptable attacks with the greatest firmness"". Writing on Twitter, he said: ""Let there be no doubt: they are looking for violence and are there to sow chaos in Paris."" By mid-afternoon, 129 people were arrested, AFP reports. Demonstrators throw cobblestones at police during clashes near the Arc de Triomphe In January, the government ordered police to crack down on violence in the protests, leading to complaints of police brutality. President Emmanuel Macron offered concessions to the protesters after the movement swept the nation - including â¬10bn (Â£8.5bn; $11bn) designed to boost the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners - but they failed to quell the discontent. For the past month, Mr Macron has toured France, listening to local mayors and citizens as part of his ""grand dÃ©bat"" - a big national debate. He has also asked communities to come together and put forward their ideas for how to fix France, and there have so far been 8,253 local meetings. The yellow vest movement has faced accusations of anti-Semitism in recent weeks after a prominent Jewish philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut, was targeted by insults and taunts in Paris. Officers in Paris intervened to form a barrier after a group of individuals involved in the march confronted Mr Finkielkraut and started verbally insulting him. Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? The 69-year-old academic told Le Parisien newspaper that he heard people shouting ""dirty Zionist"" and ""throw yourself in the canal"". A few days before Mr Finkielkraut was attacked, official data suggested there had been a 74% rise in anti-Semitic attacks in France last year.

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2019: Wales beat Ireland to complete Six Nations Grand Slam Six Nations: Wales v Ireland Wales(16) 25 Try:ParkesCon: AnscombePens:Anscombe 6 Ireland(0) 7 Try:LarmourCon:Carty Wales are celebrating a third Grand Slam in 11 years after they put Ireland to the sword in ruthless fashion to storm to the Six Nations title. After Hadleigh Parkes' early try, Gareth Anscombe added a conversion and three penalties for a 16-0 half-lead as Ireland's indiscipline cost them dear. And the fly-half added three more in an equally one-sided second period, Ireland looking nothing like the second-ranked team in world rugby, Jordan Larmour's late try no sort of consolation. Seldom in this championship have Wales been spectacular in attack but their defence has been remorseless and their fortitude under pressure remarkable, and the celebrations will go long into a sodden Cardiff night. It means Warren Gatland, in his 50th and final Six Nations match in charge, becomes the first coach in Five or Six Nations history to win three Slams, his team's record-breaking winning run now stretching to 14 games. For Ireland the tournament ended as it began, with a chastening defeat that leaves significant questions hanging over their World Cup ambitions. 'Relentless work and a deep belief' - Gatland's Grand Slam coup Reaction from the Principality Stadium It's nice when predictions come true - Gatland England and Scotland draw astonishing Test This video can not be played Six Nations: Parkes try gives Wales crucial early lead In an atmosphere of feverish excitement Wales exploded from the blocks, bundling Jacob Stockdale into touch from the kick-off and setting up a driving maul from the line-out before Anscombe's cute chip was gathered by Parkes for the centre to tumble over the line. It took a last-ditch tackle in the left-hand corner from Parkes to stop Stockdale striking back immediately after Johnny Sexton's cross-kick, although Wales then lost George North to injury, Anscombe moving to full-back, Dan Biggar coming in at fly-half and Liam Williams switching to the right wing. Ireland were being starved of possession and territory, shipping too many soft penalties, Anscombe landing one from way out wide for 10-0 with 20 minutes gone. As the rain swept in Joe Schmidt's men finally built a period of pressure but struggled to convert it into points. First Sexton kicked a penalty to the corner but the subsequent driving maul was disrupted by formidable Welsh defence, and another prime attacking opportunity was tossed away when CJ Stander tried to take a quick tap and go from a scrum free-kick 10 metres out and instead kicked it straight into a team-mate. Anscombe drilled over a second penalty of his own from 40 metres and added another with the clock red to make it 16-0 at the interval, the capacity crowd in full cry, the Slam in their sights. This video can not be played Six Nations 2019: Wales lift trophy after completing Grand Slam Ireland needed to score first in the second period but Cian Healy entered a ruck from the side and Anscombe made no mistake from the tee, Ireland's woes summed up by Sexton putting the re-start dead. The penalties kept coming. Stander failed to roll away from a ruck, Anscombe landed his 17th point. When Ireland did threaten the Welsh line through a series of powerful drives from their forwards, the ball was thrown into touch by Sexton when it finally went wide. *Wales get three bonus points for winning all five of their games So comfortable and one-sided was it that the victory songs were ringing round the three tiers of the steep-sided stadium with half an hour still to play. The tension that so many had expected was totally absent, an Ireland team who had beaten world champions New Zealand in the autumn and won a Slam of their own at Twickenham a year ago utterly unrecognisable. Anscombe's sixth penalty added salt to the wounds as the rain became torrential, the only question whether the visitors would be kept scoreless. Superlative defence on the Welsh line kept them at bay until replacement Larmour's try deep into the final moments, but nothing could dampen the mood as the final whistle sounded. In the critical first 40 minutes the Welsh captain beat more defenders and made more metres and carries than any other man on the pitch, and while Anscombe kicked the points, Jones - as he was throughout the championship - was totemic, a multiple Slam winner in his finest hour. Warren Gatland has become the first coach to win three Grand Slams in Five/Six Nations history following 2008 and 2012. Gatland has won 43 Six Nations matches, 13 more than anyone else. Wales have won their last 14 Test matches, England are the only European tier one side to have won more consecutive matches in all competitions (W18 - 2015-17, W14 - 2002-03). Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones equalled prop Gethin Jenkins' combined appearance record for Wales and the British and Irish Lions of 134 Tests. This video can not be played Six Nations: Warren Gatland proud as Wales create history Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones, speaking to BBC One:""Anything can happen when you work hard and you're a proud nation and we've shown that. ""Warren's the man at the top and we've been under pressure but he's always been unwavering. He's got a bit left on his contract but I'm sure we'll miss him when he's eventually gone. ""At times we've been unconvincing so we like to think there's still potential in us. We're well aware we've just put a big target on our backs before the World Cup."" The match was Warren Gatland's 50th and final Six Nations match in charge of Wales Wales coach Warren Gatland, speaking to BBC One:""It was a fantastic performance, we didn't look too tired did we? ""We spoke beforehand about the players playing for themselves, their families and the fans and being able to create a bit of history. You can never take that away from them now. ""I said if we won the first game against France we've got a good chance of winning the whole thing. If that creates that bit of belief in the players then maybe something like this can happen."" Ireland captain Rory Best, speaking to BBC One:""Wales had a cracking start. They built into the game. They're a very determined side and hard to beat here. ""We couldn't get a footing in the game. Our set-piece wasn't up to the standard that we expect. They put a lot of pressure on us and we struggled to respond. ""It's been a very competitive Six Nations. We have to go and address why we lost. We've been inconsistent this championship and we'll have to dust ourselves off and finish the calendar year strong. ""We can talk about the aftermath of this later on but you have to give credit to Wales - they're deserved Grand Slam winners.""

"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds speaks to the media outside the Cabinet Office on Friday The Democratic Unionist Party has said there are ""still issues to be discussed"" with the government as Theresa May continues to try to win support for her Brexit deal. Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons next week for a third vote. It comes after MPs this weekrejected her dealandvoted to delay Brexit. The DUP, which has twice voted against the agreement, said it remained in discussions with the government. It has been reported by the Spectator magazine that there isa ""better than 50:50 chance"",externalthe party will support the deal next week. MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? McVey hints she will back PM's Brexit deal A DUP spokesman denied reports that extra money for Northern Ireland had been part of the talks, despite the involvement of Chancellor Philip Hammond in discussions on Friday. The party has previously voted against the deal over concerns around the Northern Ireland backstop - an insurance policy to maintain an open border in Ireland. The 10 votes provided by the DUP, which props up the government, are thought to be key to the prime minister securing her deal. A DUP party spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the government to ensure Northern Ireland is not separated out from the rest of the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. Contrary to some reports, we are not discussing cash. ""There are still issues to be addressed in our discussions."" If the deal fails to gain support, having already been defeated in the Commons by large margins twice, Mrs May has warned a longer extension may be needed, and the UK may have to take part in European elections. Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics suggested a delay of up to two years could be required if MPs continue to reject Mrs May's withdrawal agreement. ""Number one priority would be the deal that is reached is passed,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If it is not the case, what we need is clear vision from the UK government how much time UK needs to come up with new proposals, new ideas how we proceed. ""In that case it's not a couple of months, I believe then we are talking about maybe one or two years."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey,who resigned over the Brexit agreement, suggested fellow Brexiteers could back Mrs May's ""rubbish"" deal next week to make sure the UK leaves the EU. She told BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking With Nick Robinson podcast: ""The element now is that people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal."" Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said ""quite a number"" of MPs would be prepared to support a compromise deal, with the guarantee the deal goes back to the people for a final say on Brexit. Speaking before an event in Gravesend, Kent, Mr McDonnell said politicians would move ""heaven and earth"" to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. But any final say should not be on the deal Mrs May has agreed, ""because it's not credible"", he said. Earlier,Tory MP Nick Boles resigned from his local Conservative associationafter clashing with the group over Brexit. Mr Boles, who has spoken out against leaving the EU with no deal, said a ""division had opened up"" between him and the local association. Local activists had wanted to deselect him as their candidate in the next general election because of his stance on Brexit. Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles was a ""valued member of the Conservative parliamentary party, which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive"". Separately, pro-Brexit marchers, led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage,have begun a two-week journey from Sunderland to London. About 100 people assembled to start the march. They were joined by counter-protesters, including those from anti-Brexit campaign Led by Donkeys. Mr Farage aims to walk 100 miles of the 270-mile March to Leave, which is due to arrive in the capital on 29 March.

"The problem for any novelist choosing rock'n'roll as a subject for a book is how to make their fiction stranger - and more compelling - than the truth. What can they say or reveal that hasn't been said and revealed in half-a-century of tell-all sex-and-drugs-and-rock-and-roll memoirs, from Stephen Davis's snorts-and-all biography of Led Zeppelin, Hammer of the Gods, to Keith Richards' magnificent memoir, Life? It is not an easy task. Don DeLillo did a good job in 1973 with Great Jones Street, and John Niven's dark satire Kill Your Friends is a terrific take-down of the music business. And there's Roddy Doyle's The Commitments and Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad. All succeed. But they represent the occasional one-hit wonder in a literary genre piled high with non-charting flops. The American author Taylor Jenkins Reid is the latest writer to enter the unforgiving mosh-pit that is pop fiction with her Flower-Power era novel Daisy Jones & The Six. The story starts in the mid-60s when Daisy Jones is a 14-year-old only child living with her distant but wealthy parents in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She decides to make her own fun, which involves hanging out in clubs on Sunset Strip, taking drugs, and having lots of sex. The famous Whisky A Go Go night club on Sunset Strip in LA, where Daisy Jones dreams of performing Meanwhile, over in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Billy Dunne and his brother Graham form a teenage band with three other local lads. They do okay, hire a keyboard player called Karen, become The Six and move to LA, where in due course, they hook up with the naturally gifted but constantly strung-out Miss Jones. The book is written as an oral history with each band member and associate (managers, partners, producers etc) giving their side of the story with recollections that often differ: Graham:""Billy was always in charge, you know? Billy wrote the lyrics, Billy composed and arranged all of the songs. If Billy goes to rehab the tour is over. If Billy is ready to go back to the studio, we all have to report for duty. He ran the show."" Billy:""We were all a team."" It reads like you're watching one of those low-budget TV documentaries where a bunch of people of whom you've largely never heard, recollect a culturally important past event in which they were involved. It doesn't make for the best telly, and nor does it make irresistible readingâ¦ for the first 80 pages. Thereafter, as you are drawn further and further into the bell-bottomed, drug-addled, band-on-a-verge-of-a-breakthrough world of Daisy Jones & The Six, it's like their first album: a real grower. So much so, in fact, there will be occasions when you find yourself unconsciously reaching for a mobile device to hear one of the band's songs. That is a mark of how effective Taylor Jenkins Reid's structural device is most of the time, although there are moments when the documentary realism falters and the novel slips into a slightly trite 1970s pastiche. But those moments are as rare as Daisy & The Six turning in a duff performance as they make their way from wannabes to chart-topping superstars. The author draws you into believing in the fictional superstars' success story Taylor Jenkins Reid began her career in film production, before turning to writing novels It is a much-told fable, of course, which is saved from being a hackneyed re-hash by the quality of the writing. The characters are well drawn, idiosyncratic, and believable. Their actions and opinions make sense. That authenticity extends to the passages in which the songs are written, which not only ring true in terms of the creative process but also in the lyrics, which genuinely capture the Fleetwood Mac vibe, the band appears to be based upon. Taylor Jenkins Reid says when she decided to write a book about rock 'n' roll, she remembered seeing a moment of ""love"" between Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham There is one other aspect to this novel that takes it away from the cheesy end of the market and gives it a life beyond another faux rock doc with a dim drummer. At its heart Daisy Jones & The Six is a well observed, sensitively told love story. Not a simple tale of lost and found or found and lost. But a messier exploration of what love is, what it costs, and how a life lived without it, looks. Admittedly, it is not a great literary masterpiece, but it is a great read. And given the way it has been written, which feels more like a script than a novel, it is no surprise that Reese Witherspoon bought the rights and was subsequently commissioned by Amazon to turn it into a TV series complete with soundtrack. I, for one, will be watching.

"Snow has returned to a number of areas across Scotland, including Dunblane A wintry snap returned to much of Scotland with a warning for snow in place throughout Saturday. A Met Office yellow warning was issued which lasted until 21:00. The most northerly parts of the country were not covered but ""disruptive snow"" was forecast - mainly over higher ground - further south. The Met Office also issued an ice warning for most of the country which lasted from 21:00 on Saturday until 09:30 on Sunday. Much of Scotland is covered by the warning for snow - particularly on higher ground Forecasters said 10cm (4in) of snow was possible on the hills on Saturday but no more than a ""transient slushy covering"" was expected at low levels such as the central lowlands. However, up to 6cm (2.5in) was expected at between 200m and 300m above sea level with more possible at higher levels. It came just days after Storm Gareth brought considerable travel disruption as it swept across the country. Police warned drivers that conditions could be hazardous due to the snow and that ""extra caution"" should be shown.

"The storm had earlier caused destruction in Mozambique A tropical storm has swept away bridges and homes in eastern Zimbabwe, killing at least 24 people, officials say. Cyclone Idai cut off power and communications in parts of Manicaland province on the border with Mozambique. Some 40 people are missing. People fled from their homes to the slopes of mountain and were waiting to be rescued, but strong winds have hampered helicopter flights. In Mozambique, where Idai made landfall on Thursday, at least 19 people died. Flooding across the rest of the country had already killed nearly 70 people before the storm's arrival.

It is not an easy task. Don DeLillo did a good job in 1973 with Great Jones Street, and John Niven's dark satire Kill Your Friends is a terrific take-down of the music business. And there's Roddy Doyle's The Commitments and Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad. All succeed. But they represent the occasional one-hit wonder in a literary genre piled high with non-charting flops. The American author Taylor Jenkins Reid is the latest writer to enter the unforgiving mosh-pit that is pop fiction with her Flower-Power era novel Daisy Jones & The Six. The story starts in the mid-60s when Daisy Jones is a 14-year-old only child living with her distant but wealthy parents in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She decides to make her own fun, which involves hanging out in clubs on Sunset Strip, taking drugs, and having lots of sex. The famous Whisky A Go Go night club on Sunset Strip in LA, where Daisy Jones dreams of performing Meanwhile, over in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Billy Dunne and his brother Graham form a teenage band with three other local lads. They do okay, hire a keyboard player called Karen, become The Six and move to LA, where in due course, they hook up with the naturally gifted but constantly strung-out Miss Jones. The book is written as an oral history with each band member and associate (managers, partners, producers etc) giving their side of the story with recollections that often differ: Graham:""Billy was always in charge, you know? Billy wrote the lyrics, Billy composed and arranged all of the songs. If Billy goes to rehab the tour is over. If Billy is ready to go back to the studio, we all have to report for duty. He ran the show."" Billy:""We were all a team."" It reads like you're watching one of those low-budget TV documentaries where a bunch of people of whom you've largely never heard, recollect a culturally important past event in which they were involved. It doesn't make for the best telly, and nor does it make irresistible readingâ¦ for the first 80 pages. Thereafter, as you are drawn further and further into the bell-bottomed, drug-addled, band-on-a-verge-of-a-breakthrough world of Daisy Jones & The Six, it's like their first album: a real grower. So much so, in fact, there will be occasions when you find yourself unconsciously reaching for a mobile device to hear one of the band's songs. That is a mark of how effective Taylor Jenkins Reid's structural device is most of the time, although there are moments when the documentary realism falters and the novel slips into a slightly trite 1970s pastiche. But those moments are as rare as Daisy & The Six turning in a duff performance as they make their way from wannabes to chart-topping superstars. The author draws you into believing in the fictional superstars' success story Taylor Jenkins Reid began her career in film production, before turning to writing novels It is a much-told fable, of course, which is saved from being a hackneyed re-hash by the quality of the writing. The characters are well drawn, idiosyncratic, and believable. Their actions and opinions make sense. That authenticity extends to the passages in which the songs are written, which not only ring true in terms of the creative process but also in the lyrics, which genuinely capture the Fleetwood Mac vibe, the band appears to be based upon. Taylor Jenkins Reid says when she decided to write a book about rock 'n' roll, she remembered seeing a moment of ""love"" between Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham There is one other aspect to this novel that takes it away from the cheesy end of the market and gives it a life beyond another faux rock doc with a dim drummer. At its heart Daisy Jones & The Six is a well observed, sensitively told love story. Not a simple tale of lost and found or found and lost. But a messier exploration of what love is, what it costs, and how a life lived without it, looks. Admittedly, it is not a great literary masterpiece, but it is a great read.

"The man was in the back bedroom when the tree fell down at about 07:30 GMT and caused him a minor head injury A man has been hurt by a large oak tree that crashed on to the roof of a two-storey house in high winds. A branch from the mature tree drove into one of the windows of the family home in Chetwood Road, near Crawley, where a couple and their child live. West Sussex Fire and Rescue said a man suffered a non-serious head injury. Neighbour Jeremy Clayden said he heard an ""almighty crash"" at about 07:30 GMT and said he was shocked by the extent of the damage to the first floor. The couple and their child are currently staying with neighbours. Another home nearby was also evacuated. The man was in the back bedroom when the tree came down. He was treated at the scene by South East Coast Ambulance Service. Mr Clayden,  a property surveyor, said: ""I've seen some things in my time, but never a tree of this size fall on to the back of a house. ""There had been very strong winds here before it fell. A tree surgeon and building control officer were called to the scene ""The damage is extensive, the entire rear left side of the house on the first floor is demolished and the flank wall is now bowing and most likely structurally unstable. ""It will be a big job to fix, it's no easy task just moving the tree."" West Sussex Fire and Rescue service said crews were still at the scene and the road, as well as nearby Howard Road, had been cordoned off. A building control officer is due to formally check the integrity of the building. West Sussex County Council Turn Blue Monday Orange at Littlehampton Wave!

In his letter, seen by the BBC, he said he was resigning with immediate effect and that a ""division had opened up"" between him and the local association. A simple guide to Brexit What happened this week? And what happens now? He wrote: ""I regret that my relationship with you should end in this way. But a politician without principles is worthless.

He wrote: ""As you are all aware, Nick has been at odds with the local party and the prime minister for some time, so this announcement does not come as a complete surprise, but the timing does leave a lot to be desired."" He said the process of selecting a new candidate would start at the group's AGM later this month. Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles was a ""valued member of the Conservative parliamentary party which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive"". His announcement comes after a busy week in Westminster, whenMPs voted to seek a delayto the UK's departure from the EU, due to take place on 29 March. The third ""meaningful vote"" on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is expected to take place next week. If it is agreed, she has promised to seek a short extension to the departure date.

In his letter, he said: ""While I have consistently argued that Brexit must be delivered, and have voted for the prime minister's deal every time she has brought it to the House of Commons, I am certain that crashing out of the EU without a deal would do great harm to the British people and have done everything in my power to prevent it."" Mr Boles said he was ""proud"" of his role in the cross-party campaign to force Mrs May to request an extension to Article 50 beyond 29 March and block a no-deal Brexit.

But Mr Hill told the BBC: ""Talk to the man and woman on the street and they're also quite angry that their MP seems to be going back on what he promised to do at the general election. He signed up to the manifesto about coming out of the single market and the customs union."" Nigel Farage made a speech to those taking part in a pro-Brexit march from an open top bus Meanwhile, pro-Brexit marchers, led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage,have begun a two-week journey from Sunderland to London.

Separately, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said politicians will move ""heaven and earth"" to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. Speaking before an event in Gravesend, Kent, Mr McDonnell said ""quite a number"" of MPs would be prepared to support a compromise deal, with the guarantee the deal goes back to the people for a final say on Brexit.

"Hugh Grant's daughter was played by Lily James in the Comic Relief sequel to Four Weddings Stars of Four Weddings and a Funeral reunited for the first time in 25 years to help Comic Relief raise Â£63m. In themini sequel, Rowan Atkinson returned as the bumbling vicar - this time presiding over the daughter of the two original leads, Carrie (Andie MacDowell) and Charles (Hugh Grant). Miranda, played by Lily James, was seen marrying the daughter of Fiona (Dame Kristen Scott Thomas). The show also saw the return of Keeley Hawes in a Bodyguard spin-off. This video can not be played Watch a clip of Hugh Grant and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas in the Four Weddings sequel The Four Weddings sketch - One Red Nose Day and a Wedding - also starred Alicia Vikander, who won an Oscar for her role in The Danish Girl, as Miranda's new wife. Sam Smith made a cameo as one of the wedding singers in the short film, presided over by Comic Relief co-founder Richard Curtis, writer of the original film. There were plenty of jokey references to Four Weddings, including its most-quoted line - as Grant's character claimed that he ""hadn't noticed"" it was raining. The segment featured many of the returning cast - and a special mention was made of Scarlett, played by actress Charlotte Coleman, whodied of an asthma attack,externalin 2001.

By the end of the broadcast, more than Â£63m had been raised. The last Red Nose Day, two years ago, raised Â£71.3m by the end of the evening. This year's Red Nose Day telethon also saw a dip in ratings, with an average of 5.6 million people tuning in - 600,000 fewer viewers compared to 2017. The highest amount the event has raised so far was Â£108.4m in 2011, once all the pledges had been redeemed. Half the money raised from Comic Relief goes to causes in the UK and half to those around the world. The fundraising TV show also featured an appearance from Little Mix - who looked less than impressed when former shadow chancellor Ed Balls had a go at singing one of their biggest hits, Shout Out To My Ex. The chart-topping band and the Strictly Come Dancing favourite were among a number of celebrities who climbed Africa's highest mountain Kilimanjaro to raise more than Â£2m towards the show's final total. Little Mix's Jade and Leigh-Anne looked less than impressed with Ed Balls Former England football captain David Beckham again teamed up with James Corden to poke fun at his own previous fashion choices, in a comic video monologue at the start of the night.

"Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court on Saturday in relation to the mosque attacks The main suspect in the killings of 49 people in shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday has appeared in court on a single murder charge. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, was brought to the dock in a white prison shirt and handcuffs. Further charges are expected to be made against him. PM Jacinda Ardern said Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns, adding: ""Our gun laws will change."" Two others are in custody. None of those detained had a criminal record. Mr Tarrant was described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist"". The suspect, who stood silently during the brief hearing in Christchurch, was remanded in custody without a plea and is due to appear in court again on 5 April. The court judge ruled that the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs and filming to preserve his fair trial rights. Reaction to the attacks How attacks unfolded The victims and missing Ms Ardern called the attack ""an act of terror"", and officials are still carrying out the identification of the victims. Ms Ardern said the guns used by the attacker appeared to have been modified, and that the suspect's car was full of weapons, suggesting ""his intention to continue with his attack"". Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, she said the suspect had obtained a gun licence in November 2017 that allowed him to buy the weapons used in the attack. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: NZ ""gun laws will change... now is the time"" ""The mere fact... that this individual had acquired a gun licence and acquired weapons of that range, then obviously I think people will be seeking change, and I'm committing to that."" New Zealand's Attorney-General David Parker said the government would look into banning semi-automatic weapons, but that no final decision had been made. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws in a country with a strong gun lobby and culture of hunting have failed. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Christchurch All day on Saturday the people of Christchurch have been turning out to show their rejection of the hate that inspired Friday's horrific attacks. In ones and twos and in family groups, people have been coming by the hundred to a makeshift memorial set up on the edge of Hagley Park. Outside the two mosques that were attacked, people have been laying more flowers. Many have left hand-written notes. ""This is not New Zealand,"" one read. At one point a group of young men started quietly singing a traditional Maori song, their heads bowed, eyes closed. The mayor of Christchurch said the killer had come to the city with hate in his heart, to perform an act of terrorism. But she said he did not represent anything about the city. Still, there are lots of uncomfortable questions for the authorities here. The man now in custody, Brenton Tarrant, made no secret of his support for white supremacy. He had reportedly been planning the attacks for months. And yet he was not on any police watch list. He did not have any trouble getting a gun licence, nor in buying a collection of high-powered weapons. This video can not be played Linwood imam: We still love this country The suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand,"" Ms Ardern said, without formally identifying him. She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" More about the suspects Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Before the attacks, social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The text is called The Great Replacement, a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. The man said he had began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The suspect sent the document to 70 people,external, including to Ms Ardern's generic address, less than 10 minutes before the attack, the New Zealand Herald reports. The minimum legal age to own a gun is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons All gun owners must have a licence but most individual weapons do not have to be registered, one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want More on the country's gun laws Relatives and friends have confirmed the identities of several victims, including: Daoud Nabi, 71, who is believed to have thrown himself in front of other people in the mosque to protect them Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Hosne Ara, 42, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived Pakistan's foreign ministry named six of its nationals who were killed,external, and said another three missing were still being identified. Ms Ardern said financial support would be made available to those who had lost someone on whom they were financially dependent. A total of 48 people were wounded and 11 are said to be in a critical condition in hospital. Omar Nabi holds a phone with a picture of his father Daoud outside the court building Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel expressed ""revulsion"" at this ""act of terrorism"", saying: ""We have welcomed new people into our city. They're our friends, they're our neighbours."" Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million, according to the latest census figures. Numbers rose sharply as the country took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch during Friday prayers at 13:40 (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. He fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. Social media's role in attack Anger and solidarity at UK gathering The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. Police say they recovered firearms from both mosques, and explosive devices were found in a car belonging to one of the suspects.

"This video can not be played Victim's brother: ""No words to describe the pain"" The brother of a Pakistani man who was killed during Friday's twin mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, has told the BBC of his pride and pain. Khursheed Alam said he was proud his brother, who was killed alongside his son, had tried to tackle the gunman. ""I wish I could die like him,"" he said. Fifty people are now known to have died with another 50 injured. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, live-streamed the attack on Facebook. He has been charged with one count of murder. On Saturday, he appeared in court in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. Further charges are expected to be levelled against him. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns. ""Our gun laws will change,"" she added.

Two others are in custody, but police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. One had gone to help armed with a gun - and has been charged with firearms offences, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. An 18-year-old was also arrested but his involvement was said to be ""tangential"" and he would appear in court on Monday, he added. None of those detained had a criminal record. Fifty people are known to have been injured - two remain in a critical condition, said the police commissioner. Naeem Rashid, 50, and his 21-year-old son Talha had been living in New Zealand since 2010. Mr Rashid has been hailed as a hero on social media after being seen in a video of the attacks apparently trying to tackle the gunman at Al Noor mosque before being shot. His brother, in the northern Pakistani city of Abbottabad, told the BBC's Secunder Kermani he was proud of his actions. ""He was a brave person,"" Mr Alam said. ""I've heard from people there... there were a few witnesses who said he saved a few lives by trying to stop that guy."" But he went to add that even though his brother was being hailed as a hero by some people, it was ""still a shock for us"". ""It's our pride now, but still the loss - it's like cutting your limb off really."" This video can not be played Ali Adeeba: ""He (his father) is the one that actually took a bullet for me"" Mr Alam said he was angry. ""Terrorists don't have a religion,"" he said, adding ""crazy people"" had to be stopped. At the other mosque attacked, in Linwood, a similar intervention occurred. Abdul Aziz says he ran towards the gunman outside the mosque, throwing a credit card machine at him. In the ensuing chase, the gunman dropped one of his weapons and went to fetch more from his car, when Mr Aziz tossed the gun towards him, smashing the car window. The gunman then drove off and was arrested moments later. Officials in New Zealand are now carrying out the difficult task of identifying those who died. They have shared a list of victims with families, but not released it publicly.

"Fifty-one people were killed and dozens more wounded in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March 2019. A lone gunman pleaded guilty to the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre and was convicted. Below are the names and, where available, pictures of those who died. Many had moved to New Zealand to study or to work, and to build a better life for themselves and their families. Some were refugees, who thought they had found safety. The 70-year-old father of four from Somalia was killed at the Al Noor mosque. His son Said arrived at the mosque as the attack was underway, saw the gunman in the street and drove off. ""This is devastating. My father survived through civil war. I never thought this kind of stuff would happen to him in New Zealand,"" he told the Washington Post. Abdul Fattah Qasem Ibrahim Qasem was the former secretary of the Muslim Association of Canterbury was a respected elder in the Muslim community and helped with interpretation for refugees and migrants from the Middle East. ""He is a massive man, a giant. He has a heart of gold. He was that fantastic person who just wanted everyone to be amazing,"" his son-in-law Mohammed Al-Kubaisy told Stuff. He was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality. His death was confirmed by the Egyptian migration ministry. ""My dad was a good kind man,"" his son Omar told the BBC. ""Him and mum had great jobs and were well off in Egypt but they immigrated to NZ in 1996 for me. For my education, so that I could have a better chance to study what I want. We have been here 23 years."" ""He had many friends and family who loved him,â he added. âHe was a pure hearted soul who never treated anyone badly."" The retired engineer was killed while praying, his wife told the New Zealand Herald. ""We should be strong, especially in this case. I lose my husband but I'm not angry. I'm sad because I don't see him again, I don't talk to him again,"" Nuha Asad said. ""I'm happy in the same time because it happened while he prayed. I take comfort because he was a good man."" The Palestinian doctor's family believe he was killed in the attack at the mosque where he prayed every Friday. Mr Hamid and his wife Hahan moved to New Zealand 23 years ago, and had two sons. Mr Hamid specialised in cardiorespiratory illnesses for the Canterbury District Health Board. Ansi Alibava was at the mosque with her husband Ponnath Abdul Nazer, who worked in a local supermarket. The pair had moved to Christchurch from Kerala, India, in February last year so Ms Alibava could study for a master's degree in agricultural engineering. ""She loved all people - cousins, friends,"" Mr Nazer told the BBC. ""She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members.""
                        He said she had been living her dream by studying and travelling in New Zealand. Neither of them had previously been outside Kerala. They have been financially supporting their families. Ashraf Ali, from Fiji, had gone to the Al Noor mosque with his brother, Ramzan. Ramzan Ali said he managed to hide from the gunman, but his brother did not escape. Ramzan Ali told the New Zealand Herald he watched the video of the attack, and recognised his 58-year-old brother because of his Fijian rugby shirt. ""I will never be able to forget him. If he wanted to do something he would just do it. He won't even think twice. And he was always successful."" Ashraf Al-Masri was one of four Egyptian victims named by the Egyptian government. The father of two leaves behind a wife and two children. They are accompanying their husband and father's body back to Egypt for burial. He was one of four Egyptians killed in the attack. Ashraf Morsi's brother, Khaled, told BBC Arabic that their mother had been left broken by the death of her son. He said she repeats his name over and over again. Asif Vora was killed at the Al Noor mosque alongside his son Ramiz. Insurance agent Asif had recently become a grandfather. He and his wife had travelled to Christchurch from their home in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, last month to see the new baby, his brother Mahsin told BBC Gujarati. Atta Elayyan was the goalkeeper for New Zealand's futsal (a form of five-a-side football) team and chief executive of technology consultancy and app developer LWA Solutions, which he founded in 2010. ""There is huge hole in our hearts,"" said Josh Margetts, NZF's futsal development manager. ""Atta was a great man and well liked by everyone in the Futsal Whites squad and the futsal community. There are no words to sum up how we are all feeling. He will be sorely missed."" Mr Elayyan, who was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality, leaves behind a wife, Farah, and a two-year-old daughter, Aya. Daoud Nabi was born in Afghanistan, but moved his family to New Zealand in the 1980s to escape the Soviet invasion. The 71-year-old is believed to have thrown himself in front of other people in the mosque to protect them when the gunman burst in. He was an engineer, reportedly with a love of vintage cars, but in his retirement was a community leader in New Zealand.

"This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded A gunman opened fire in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more. As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. This series of events has, once again, shone a spotlight on how sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit try - and fail - to address far-right extremism on their platforms. Attacks mapped What is known about the suspects? As the video continued to spread, other members of the public put up their own posts pleading with people to stop sharing it. One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. About 10 to 20 minutes before the attack in New Zealand, someone posted on the /pol/section of 8chan, a message board popular with the alt-right. The post included links to the suspect's Facebook page, where he stated he would be live-streaming and published a rambling and hate-filled document That document was, asBellingcat analyst Robert Evans points out,external, filled with ""huge amounts of content, most of it ironic, low-quality trolling"" and memes, in order to distract and confuse people The suspect also referenced a meme in the actual video. Before opening fire he shouted ""subscribe to PewDiePie"", a reference toa meme about keeping YouTube star PewDiePie as the most-subscribed-to channel on the platform,external. PewDiePiehas been embroiled in a race row before, so some have speculated that the attacker knew that mentioning him would provoke a reaction online. PewDiePie later said on Twitter he was ""absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person"" The attacks were live-streamed on Facebook and, despite the original being taken down, were quickly replicated and shared widely on other platforms, including YouTube and Twitter People continue to report seeing the video, despite the sites acting pretty swiftly to remove the original and copies, and copies are still being uploaded to YouTube faster than it can remove them Several Australian media outlets broadcast some of the footage, as did other major newspapers around the world Ryan Mac, a BuzzFeed technology reporter,,externalhas created a timeline of where he has seen the video, including it being shared from a verified Twitter account with 694,000 followers. He claims it has been up for two hours While huge numbers of people have been duplicating and sharing the footage online, many others responded with disgust - urging others not only not to share the footage, but not even to watch it. Spreading the video, many said, was what the attacker had wanted people to do. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The website later removed the document, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Daily Mirror editor Lloyd Embley also tweeted that they had removed the footage, and that publishing it was""not in line with our policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos"",external. All of the social media firms have sent heartfelt sympathy to the victims of the mass shootings, reiterating that they act quickly to remove inappropriate content. Facebook said: ""New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we removed both the shooter's Facebook account and the video. ""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand Police as their response and investigation continues.""

In terms of what they have done historically to combat the threat of far-right extremists, the social media companies' approach has been more chequered. Twitter acted to remove alt-right accounts in December 2017. Previously it has removed and then reinstated the account of Richard Spencer, an American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right"". Facebook, which suspended Mr Spencer's account in April 2018, admitted at the time that it was difficult to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political speech. Agonising wait for victims' families UK mosque security to be discussed This month, YouTube was accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible for its handling of a video promoting the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. British MP Yvette Cooper said the video-streaming platform had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the service. Dr Ciaran Gillespie, a political scientist from Surrey University, thinks the problem goes far deeper than a video, shocking as that content has been. ""It is not just a question about broadcasting a massacre live. The social media platforms raced to close that down and there is not much they can do about it being shared because of the nature of the platform, but the bigger question is the stuff that goes before it,"" he said. At least 49 people were killed in the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch As a political researcher, he uses YouTube ""a lot"" and says that he is often recommended far-right content. ""There is oceans of this content on YouTube and there is no way of estimating how much. YouTube has dealt well with the threat posed by Islamic radicalisation, because this is seen as clearly not legitimate, but the same pressure does not exist to remove far-right content, even though it poses a similar threat. ""There will be more calls for YouTube to stop promoting racist and far-right channels and content."" His views are echoed by Dr Bharath Ganesh, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""Taking down the video is obviously the right thing to do, but social media sites have allowed far-right organisations a place for discussion and there has been no consistent or integrated approach to dealing with it. ""There has been a tendency to err on the side of freedom of speech, even when it is obvious that some people are spreading toxic and violent ideologies."" Now social media companies need to ""take the threat posed by these ideologies much more seriously"", he added. ""It may mean creating a special category for right-wing extremism, recognising that it has global reach and global networks."" Neither under-estimate the magnitude of the task, especially as many of the exponents of far-right views are adept at, what Dr Gillespie calls, ""legitimate controversy"". ""People will discuss the threat posed by Islam and acknowledge it is contentious but point out that it is legitimate to discuss,"" he said. These grey areas are going to be extremely difficult for the social media firms to tackle, they say, but after the tragedy unfolding in New Zealand, many believe they must try harder.

"New Zealand has said it will reform its gun laws after 50 people were killed in a mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch. In 2016 New Zealand Police estimated that there were 1.2 million legal firearms owned by civilians - that equates to around one for every four people. So, what does the law say now? The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm. All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons don't have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case. In order to own a gun legally, applicants for a firearm licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records. Factors like mental health, addiction and domestic violence should be considered. Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Christchurch shootings: Social media's role Once a licence has been issued, gun-owners can buy as many weapons as they want. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. While most guns don't have to be registered, a special application does have to be made to police to own military-style semi-automatic weapons, pistols, or other restricted firearms. Because of this, police say they can't be sure how many legally owned firearms there are in the country as there is ""no record of the majority of firearms"". As of June 2018, there were 246,952 active firearms licences including dealers and individual owners. The year before, of the 43,509 who people applied for firearms licences, 43,321 were granted them. Until the mosque attacks, New Zealand's worst mass shooting was in 1990 in the small seaside town of Aramoana on the South Island, in which 13 people were killed. That shooting prompted an amendment to the the Arms Act (1983), the main law governing gun use and ownership, restricting the ownership of military-style semi-automatic weapons. But parliament stopped short of a total ban. The law was further amended in 2012 to clarify which weapons are restricted. In a response to an official request for information last year, New Zealand Police published figures showing that 859 restricted-category firearms were seized by police between 2008 and 2017. During the same period, 12,688 firearms of all types were seized. Police figures show that in the decade to 2017-18, there were 28 homicides involving a firearm where the offender had a current firearms licence, and 126 homicides where the offender had never held a firearms licence.

"An image of Andrew Graystone outside a Manchester mosque was widely shared A man who stood outside a Manchester mosque after the shooting of 50 people at mosques in New Zealand said he wanted to ""respond with friendship"". Andrew Graystone was pictured with a placard saying: ""You are my friends. I will keep watch while you pray."" He said Muslims at a Levenshulme mosque ""beamed"" when they saw his act. ""There are two ways you can respond to an attack like this -  you can respond with fear or you can respond with friendship,"" he said.

"This video can not be played London imam Mohammed Mahmoud calls for a crackdown on far-right extremism There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated tovictims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"". The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"". New Zealand mosque shootings kill 49 Outpouring of support from UK after NZ attack Lawrence Lewis said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"" Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered... ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"". ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said. The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said. ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred."" ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together,"" said Yelda Mahmood Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together. ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that? ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships."" Sadiq Khan and faith and community leaders gathered for the event at the East London Mosque In the wake of the attack,police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace.""

"Brittany Ferries is one of two suppliers which has a contract to provide extra ferry services The government will be forced to spend tens of millions of additional pounds to keep its no-deal ferry contracts in place if Brexit is delayed. Sources have confirmed to the BBC extra payments will need to be made to two ferry companies, to cover their costs of preparing for a 29 March exit. Extra ferries may be needed in case of congestion on roads to the coast. Brittany Ferries, one of the contractors, said it had already incurred large fuel and staffing costs. It said it would need to be compensated for those expenses. In December the Department for Transport contracted three suppliers to provide additional capacity on cross-channel ferries that carry lorries. Sources close to the Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed to the BBC that additional payments would have to be made to Brittany Ferries and Danish ferry company DFDS to cover their costs so far. Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Brittany Ferries said it had planned 20 additional weekly sailings - the equivalent of 2,000 nautical miles - employed extra staff, and moved 20,000 passenger bookings to accommodate the DfT. ""The new schedule cannot now be changed, even as an extension to Article 50 [meaning Brexit is delayed] seems likely,"" it added in a statement. Although the UK could still leave the EU as planned on 29 March, MPs have voted in favour ofasking the EU to delay Brexit. A DfT spokesperson said that ""the legal default in UK and EU law remains that the UK will leave the EU without a deal [on 29 March] unless something else is agreed"". They added: ""The government has always been clear that any extra capacity that is not used can be sold back to the market."" The government's procurement of additional cross-channel ferry services has already seen the collapse of a contract with ferry company Seaborne Freight and a Â£33m compensation payment to Eurotunnel. Seaborne Freight had its deal cancelled after the Irish company backing it pulled out. Shortly after it was awarded the contract, theBBC found out that Seaborne had no shipsand had never run a ferry service. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel sued the government because it had not been considered for a contract. It argued that unlike Seaborne, it has actually run a cross-Channel ferry service - MyFerryLink, which closed in 2015 - and should have been approached. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has been heavily criticised for the Seaborne deal, which would have been worth Â£13.8m. A report in February by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that the deals with DFDS, Brittany Ferries and Seaborne Freight, worth more than Â£100m, contained no provision for the start date to be delayed beyond 29 March. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, called this decision ""shocking"" and accused Transport Secretary Chris Grayling of ""squandering huge amounts of public money"". But a Whitehall source said the contingency sailings had to be ready for the original Brexit date, and referred to the possibility of further payments as ""the cost of keeping no-deal on the table"". The NAO also said that the cancellation of all three contracts prior to the end of March would incur a maximum termination charge of Â£56.6m.

"Ms Fadil was writing a book about her experiences A murder investigation is under way in Italy after the death of a Moroccan model who testified against former PM Silvio Berlusconi in 2012. Imane Fadil, 33, died on 1 March in a Milan hospital, a month after being admitted with stomach pains. At the time she said she had been poisoned. Italian media say she may have been poisoned with a radioactive substance. She was a key witness against Mr Berlusconi, who was accused of paying for sex with an underage prostitute. The many trials of Berlusconi Mr Berlusconi, 82, was initially convicted but then acquitted on appeal. He was later convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to carry out community service. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Berlusconi said: ""It's always a pity when a young person dies. I never met this person, never talked to her. ""What I read of her statements made me think that everything was invented, absurd,"" he said. Mr Berlusconi - who has served as prime minister in four governments - is still facing a number of charges, including bribery. He denies the allegations. Milan chief prosecutor Francesco Greco told Reuters news agency there were ""several anomalies"" in Ms Fadil's medical records. ""The doctors have not identified with any certainty any pathology which can explain the death,"" he said. Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reported that Milan's hospital had sent samples to a specialist laboratory. The results suggested the presence of a mix of radioactive substances, including cobalt. This has not been confirmed by Italian prosecutors. Italian media also report that Ms Fadil - a regular guest at Mr Berlusconi's sex parties - was writing a book about her experiences, and magistrates investigating her death have obtained a copy of the manuscript. Mr Berlusconi's reputation was tarnished by allegations about the parties at his private villa. Both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug denied they had sex In October 2010, it emerged that Mr Berlusconi had called a police station asking for the release of a 17-year-old girl, Karima ""Ruby"" El Mahroug. She was being held for theft and was also said to have attended his so-called ""bunga-bunga"" parties. An explanation of bunga bunga In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying her for sex, and of abuse of power.The case was eventually overturned in 2014. Mr Berlusconi has always maintained he is ""no saint"" but firmly rejects claims he has ever paid for sex with a woman, saying: ""I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest.""

"Eight million tonnes of plastics enter the oceans each year One hundred and seventy countries have pledged to ""significantly reduce"" the use of plastics by 2030. After five days of talks at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, a non-binding resolution was made over throwaway items like plastic bags. An initial proposal to phase out single-use plastic by 2025 was opposed by several nations including the US. Over eight million tonnes of plastic enter the world's oceans each year. ""It's hard to find one solution for all member states,"" Siim Kiisler, the UN assembly president, told journalists before the vote. ""The environment is at a turning point.

The assembly is the world's top international environment body, and this week's pledge will set the tone for the UN's Climate Action Summit in September.

"This video can not be played London imam Mohammed Mahmoud calls for a crackdown on far-right extremism There was a message of solidarity as faith and community leaders, joined by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, held a gathering at the East London Mosque dedicated tovictims of the New Zealand mosque shootings. Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up at the event in Whitechapel, as one speaker after another called for people to come together, across countries and religions. The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Rashid Khan, expressed ""solidarity and companionship with all the people who are suffering from the heinous act of violence against minority communities"". The Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said an ""attack on faith anywhere"" was an ""attack on faith everywhere"". But there was also an obvious sense of anger from the Muslim community - not just at the attackers but also the media, politicians, and other public figures for ""demonising"" Muslims. Mohammed Mahmoud, an imam who was praised for his response to an attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in 2017, said the security and peace of Muslims was under threat. He said people in power were partly responsible for ""perpetuating the narrative of otherness of a group who are perceived as infiltrators, and the dehumanisation and the vilification of Muslims who, by and large, are peaceful, law-abiding, loving citizens"". New Zealand mosque shootings kill 49 Outpouring of support from UK after NZ attack Lawrence Lewis said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"" Others were critical of the media for giving a platform to people they say are openly Islamophobic, as well as the coverage of terror attacks. Jusna Begum, 43, who believes Islamophobia is getting worse, said: ""I've stopped reading them, how attacks are covered... ""A simple headline will always go back to the religion, for example this Australian guy, we won't say white, or Christian, we say mad men."" Lawrence Lewis, 28, said the media ""fuels the fire and makes the problem worse"". ""I feel like a lot of the time the Western narrative of the media is to demonise Islam, because they think that the laws and principles of Islam go against their ideology, and it doesn't,"" he said. Sheila McGregor, of the Tower Hamlets Stand Up To Racism group, said the ""demonisation"" of Muslims was a ""global phenomenon"" and had been carried out by politicians for ""decades"". ""This kind of act happens when people feel it is legitimate and it's legitimised from the top,"" she said. The role of language in fomenting anti-Islam sentiment was touched on by several of the speakers, including the London mayor. Mr Khan did not reference the media or any politicians directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and at their role in people becoming radicalised. ""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use, and the messages we amplify,"" the mayor said. ""There are some people in our city, in our country, who fan the flames of hatred."" ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together,"" said Yelda Mahmood Others spoke of their shock at the New Zealand attack and their fear that something similar might happen in other mosques. Yelda Mahmood, 28, who had travelled from the US to London, said: ""Humanity as a whole needs to come together. ""It doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you practice. ""How can someone go to someone's house of worship and do something like that? ""It happens on the streets and in our neighbourhoods and now in our place of worships."" Sadiq Khan and faith and community leaders gathered for the event at the East London Mosque In the wake of the attack,police have increased patrols at British mosques to provide reassurance. But Mohammed Mahmoud said there also needed to be more done to prevent people from spreading their Islamophobic views. He added: ""We demand that these platform providers, these people who provide columns and airtime for such individuals are called out and exposed and scandalised for their crimes against not only a group of Muslims who are peace loving, but also the crimes of disturbing the peace."" Mr Khan said he hoped the increased presence of police at mosques would reassure worshippers. ""As far as we are concerned our diversity is a strength not weakness,"" he said.

"A 29-year-old man died at the scene before paramedics arrived A 29-year-old man has been stabbed to death in a fight in south-west London. He was stabbed at the junction of Gowan Avenue and Munster Road in Fulham in the early hours of Saturday and died at the scene. Neighbours said they heard an argument unfolding at 00:30 GMT, before police and paramedics arrived. A friend of the victim's described him as a ""good and big man"" and said: ""At the age of 29, you don't do silly things like this, knife crimes."" The friend, who asked not to be named, said he was not aware of any similar violent incidents in the residential area but added: ""There might have been a stabbing in this area, don't get me wrong, but they are normally with kids, not people our age."" Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham, said he had thanked the local ""hero"" who gave CPR to the victim and also thanked a group of girls from New Zealand who had stopped to help.

"Eight million tonnes of plastics enter the oceans each year One hundred and seventy countries have pledged to ""significantly reduce"" the use of plastics by 2030. After five days of talks at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, a non-binding resolution was made over throwaway items like plastic bags. An initial proposal to phase out single-use plastic by 2025 was opposed by several nations including the US. Over eight million tonnes of plastic enter the world's oceans each year. ""It's hard to find one solution for all member states,"" Siim Kiisler, the UN assembly president, told journalists before the vote. ""The environment is at a turning point. We don't need verbose documents, we need concrete commitments."" Coca-Cola reveals how much plastic it uses Giant plastic catcher heads for Pacific Ocean clean-up The woman who found hidden warming gases in waste More than 4,700 delegates - including environment ministers, scientists and business figures - took part in the meeting. A series of other commitments were also signed, including ones to reduce food wastage and to consult with indigenous populations over the development of new regulations. The assembly is the world's top international environment body, and this week's pledge will set the tone for the UN's Climate Action Summit in September. The final ministerial statement only made only two references to man-made global warming, however, and none to the damage caused by fossil fuels that drive it. However some campaigners have expressed concern that the final ministerial statement made only two references to man-made global warming. Others have criticised countries like the United States, Cuba and Saudi Arabia for blocking attempts to pledge an earlier date for cutting their use of plastics. ""The vast majority of countries came together to develop a vision for the future of global plastic governance,"" said David Azoulay from the Center for International Environmental Law, in an interview with Reuters. ""Seeing the US, guided by the interests of the fracking and petrochemical industry, leading efforts to sabotage that vision is disheartening"".

"The man was in the back bedroom when the tree fell down at about 07:30 GMT and caused him a minor head injury A man has been hurt by a large oak tree that crashed on to the roof of a two-storey house in high winds. A branch from the mature tree drove into one of the windows of the family home in Chetwood Road, near Crawley, where a couple and their child live. West Sussex Fire and Rescue said a man suffered a non-serious head injury. Neighbour Jeremy Clayden said he heard an ""almighty crash"" at about 07:30 GMT and said he was shocked by the extent of the damage to the first floor. The couple and their child are currently staying with neighbours. Another home nearby was also evacuated. The man was in the back bedroom when the tree came down. He was treated at the scene by South East Coast Ambulance Service. Mr Clayden,  a property surveyor, said: ""I've seen some things in my time, but never a tree of this size fall on to the back of a house. ""There had been very strong winds here before it fell. A tree surgeon and building control officer were called to the scene ""The damage is extensive, the entire rear left side of the house on the first floor is demolished and the flank wall is now bowing and most likely structurally unstable. ""It will be a big job to fix, it's no easy task just moving the tree."" West Sussex Fire and Rescue service said crews were still at the scene and the road, as well as nearby Howard Road, had been cordoned off. A building control officer is due to formally check the integrity of the building. West Sussex County Council Turn Blue Monday Orange at Littlehampton Wave!

"Snow has returned to a number of areas across Scotland, including Dunblane A wintry snap returned to much of Scotland with a warning for snow in place throughout Saturday. A Met Office yellow warning was issued which lasted until 21:00. The most northerly parts of the country were not covered but ""disruptive snow"" was forecast - mainly over higher ground - further south. The Met Office also issued an ice warning for most of the country which lasted from 21:00 on Saturday until 09:30 on Sunday. Much of Scotland is covered by the warning for snow - particularly on higher ground Forecasters said 10cm (4in) of snow was possible on the hills on Saturday but no more than a ""transient slushy covering"" was expected at low levels such as the central lowlands. However, up to 6cm (2.5in) was expected at between 200m and 300m above sea level with more possible at higher levels. It came just days after Storm Gareth brought considerable travel disruption as it swept across the country. Police warned drivers that conditions could be hazardous due to the snow and that ""extra caution"" should be shown. Anyone travelling was advised to ensure their vehicle was ""adequately prepared"" with sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing and food and water in case of any delays. Drivers were also advised to charge their mobile phones and plan their route and alternative routes. Gritters were also out in force across the country ahead of the forecast bad weather.

"Potential victims of trafficking are reported to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) The number of potential trafficking and modern slavery victims reported to the authorities has risen by 36% in a year, National Crime Agency figures show. Last year, 6,993 potential victims were referred into the government system, up from 5,142 in 2017 and 3,804 in 2016. But the Human Trafficking Foundation told the Victoria Derbyshire Programme the system is failing to provide long-term support for victims. The Home Office says its work ensures thousands of people receive support. Potential victims are reported to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), which is designed to identify and support victims, while making the prosecution of traffickers easier. Once a victim has signed the form and entered the NRM, the Home Office and the UK Human Trafficking Centre must decide whether to class a person a victim of slavery within 45 days. Once a victim is in the system they can access legal advice, accommodation, protection and support. Tamara Barnett from the Human Trafficking Foundation said a lot of survivors are sent home, or disappear 'into the ether, back into destitution'. ""We've heard from police officers who have referred people into the NRM repeatedly because each time they leave the NRM they're becoming destitute, being re-trafficked, and the police are identifying them again. ""The NRM just isn't working on that long-term scale."" Meanwhile, the Local Government Association has released figures from the National Crime Agency (NCA), showing council referrals of suspected victims have risen from 131 in 2013 to 1,306 in 2018. It says this has increased by 66% in the last year alone, from 789 in 2017 - putting councils under financial pressure. And it is thought the figures are not reflective of the full scale of the problem in the UK. Helen Gordos, a tactical adviser at the NCA, said: ""In 2013 an estimate was produced by the government that there were approximately 10-13,000 people held in some sort of slavery conditions."" A Home Office spokesman said the government is leading the fight with the Modern Slavery Act and Modern Slavery Strategy. ""Every year the National Referral Mechanism ensures thousands of victims and survivors of modern slavery receive specialist and tailored support, including accommodation, and mental and physical healthcare,"" he said. ""We are reforming the National Referral Mechanism to ensure quicker, more effective decision-making, and have more than doubled the number of caseworkers to reduce the number of people waiting for a decision.""

"This video can not be played Melanie Owen alleged the Tory party was moving backwards A former Conservative employee has claimed she was subjected to racist comments by some fellow party members. Melanie Owen joined the party in 2014 but quit last year over what she considered its inability to deal with the issue. Ms Owen said she was told she had small hands because her ancestors picked cotton, and was made to discuss the so-called ""economic benefits"" of slavery. The party said such comments were ""completely unacceptable"". Ms Owen said she raised concerns with party officials about the issue, but was unhappy about with how it was dealt with. FM denounces 'racist' burka comments Muslims warn PM of Johnson 'whitewash' Abuse 'reality of being black' - Gething The former party activist, who worked for Welsh Secretary and Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns until last year, appeared frequently on radio and TV as a Conservative spokeswoman and a Vote Leave representative during the 2016 Brexit Referendum. ""The Conservative Party needs to decide if it wants individuals who say these types of things to represent them, even if it's only on a grass-roots level,"" she toldBBC Wales' Sunday Politics Walesprogramme. ""I don't feel that the party does enough to combat this. ""If that's the type of member that it wants representing it... it's mad."" The public relations consultant, who lives in Ceredigion, says she knows of others who also left the party because of similar experiences. ""I can recall one joke being made that I have small hands because my ancestors would have needed them for picking cotton,"" she said. ""I should have said something, but when you're in a room full of people who think it's hilarious, it's very difficult."" Melanie Owen represented Vote Leave during the 2016 referendum campaign Ms Owen said she had been ""made to feel quite uncomfortable being made to discuss the economic benefits of slavery, which I felt is not something I should have been subjected to"". While she said only a small number of individuals were involved, Ms Owen said she felt there was an ""overriding sentiment that this was okay to be saying"" and that it became ""quite prolific"". Ms Owen said she believed the party was more liberal in 2014 but there was now ""a little bit of hostility"" in the Conservatives towards people from an ethnic minority background. ""I think there is a move backwards,"" she said, adding that it was celebrated especially among the youth members. ""They need to make a decision as to whether or not racism is something they need to take seriously. ""If they do, they need to do a lot better job of taking individuals to task. ""Otherwise they're going to be losing members who could be doing a lot of good, not forcing it to regress back to the party it probably was in the 50s and 60s."" A Conservative party spokesman said: ""Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong and will not be tolerated, and these kinds of comments are completely unacceptable. ""When cases are reported to the complaints process, an investigation is launched and action will be taken whenever necessary.""

"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

"Ms Loughlin, who was fired from Hallmark, is named in the lawsuit A US mother has filed a $500bn (Â£375bn) lawsuit against the people charged in a university admissions scandal, claiming her son was unfairly denied placement. Jennifer Kay Toy cited the ""despicable actions"" of the alleged conspirators as the reason her child was not admitted to some universities he had applied to. A separate class action suit brought by current students has been filed against the universities named by US officials. The students say a ""warped and rigged"" admission scandal cost them money.

"Sir Vince has said he wants to spend more time with his family and pursuing other interests Sir Vince Cable has announced he will step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats in May, saying it has been a ""privilege"" to lead the party at a ""crucial time"". Sir Vince's 22-month tenure has seen the party languish in the opinion polls and struggle to capitalise on its anti-Brexit stance. But with the UK's departure from the EU ""postponed, and very possibly stopped"", as Sir Vince put it, retirement beckons for the party's 75-year-old leader. While he spends his time writing novels, having dancing lessons and seeing more of his family, the Lib Dems are beginning to think about what lies ahead. After a period in coalition government with the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats suffered badly in the 2015 general election, losing 49 of their 57 MPs. They now sit alongside the Independent Group (Tig) as the joint-fourth largest grouping in the House of Commons, with 11 MPs. But while the breakaway group of ex-Conservative and Labour MPs has the benefit of being a new entity attracting considerable attention, the Liberal Democrats have struggled to make headway in the opinion polls and both the Lib Dems and Tig have dismissed talk of any kind of merger. The Lib Dems claim their membership has more than doubled since 2014, to about 99,000, but they're attempting to broaden their appeal with a registered supporters' scheme. The party has also struggled to reach double figures in opinion polls even at a time when the two main parties have suffered with splits and controversies. Jo Swinson was a minister in the coalition and has been deputy leader since 2017 Layla Moran had been a prominent supporter of the People's Vote campaign Although a leadership contest will not officially begin until after the English local elections in May, possible contenders are already emerging. Leading candidates include the current deputy leader Jo Swinson, relative newcomer Layla Moran and former environment secretary Ed Davey. One senior party figure said ""a good contest"" was important to allow a candidate to emerge who could ""move the party forward, lead and inspire people to join"". Sir Vince acknowledged the Lib Dems had been punished for their time in coalition with the Conservatives, and party members will consider how closely any potential new leader would be associated with that period. Gina Miller has ruled herself out of the contest At their spring conference in York this weekend, party members will vote on changes to rules which would allow registered supporters to have a say in a future leadership contest. This would mean far more people would be eligible to vote, in a similar way to Labour's last leadership contest which saw 180,000 registered supporters participate. The overhaul could also allow non-MPs to stand for the party leadership, although the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who had been seen as a possible candidate, has ruled herself out. ""We will survive"" - the short answer Sir Vince Cable gave when asked in September if the party needed to change fundamentally to remain in existence. But to regain a place in the mainstream of British politics, the Lib Dems must do more than survive, they must flourish. There is clear untapped potential to win support from people opposed to Brexit and turned off by the two main parties and their internal struggles. One test will be May's local elections, and if a general election comes sooner than scheduled in 2022, the party will have for the first time a clear verdict from voters on Vince Cable's time in charge. Whoever leads the party next will be starting from a relatively low base and renewing the party's appeal will be at once an opportunity and a daunting task.

"Snow has returned to a number of areas across Scotland, including Dunblane A wintry snap returned to much of Scotland with a warning for snow in place throughout Saturday. A Met Office yellow warning was issued which lasted until 21:00. The most northerly parts of the country were not covered but ""disruptive snow"" was forecast - mainly over higher ground - further south. The Met Office also issued an ice warning for most of the country which lasted from 21:00 on Saturday until 09:30 on Sunday. Much of Scotland is covered by the warning for snow - particularly on higher ground Forecasters said 10cm (4in) of snow was possible on the hills on Saturday but no more than a ""transient slushy covering"" was expected at low levels such as the central lowlands. However, up to 6cm (2.5in) was expected at between 200m and 300m above sea level with more possible at higher levels. It came just days after Storm Gareth brought considerable travel disruption as it swept across the country. Police warned drivers that conditions could be hazardous due to the snow and that ""extra caution"" should be shown. Anyone travelling was advised to ensure their vehicle was ""adequately prepared"" with sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing and food and water in case of any delays. Drivers were also advised to charge their mobile phones and plan their route and alternative routes. Gritters were also out in force across the country ahead of the forecast bad weather.

"Sir Philip Green is working on a restructuring of his Arcadia Group retail empire that includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge. The billionaire's company said in a statement that it was suffering ""an exceptionally challenging retail market"" in the UK. Arcadia was therefore ""exploring options"" to bolster the business. Job cuts and store closures are likely, but they would not be ""significant"", Arcadia insisted. There were reports on Friday that Sir Philip was considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that would enable him to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Arcadia said that it was issuing its statement in response to that media speculation, but made no mention about a CVA nor potential sales. ""Within an exceptionally challenging retail market and given the continued pressures that are specific to the UK high street we are exploring several options to enable the business to operate in a more efficient manner,"" Arcadia said. ""None of the options being explored involve a significant number of redundancies or store closures. The business continues to operate as usual including all payments being made to suppliers as normal,"" it added. CVAs can be used to cut shop rent bills, and other costs, but they are controversial and when House of Fraser used the arrangement it sparked a huge legal battle with landlords. News that one of the UK's biggest fashion retail groups is struggling comes after a string of High Street names hit financial trouble. Debenhams, New Look, Mothercare, House of Fraser, HMV and LK Bennett are among a roll-call of retailers hit by weak consumer confidence, higher costs, and the growth of online rivals. Philip Green 'paid harassment accuser Â£1m' Karren Brady quits Philip Green's empire Philip Green's Topshop facing boycott Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers. Arcadia also owns Evans and Wallis. Last year Sir Philip was embroiled in claims - strongly denied - of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. The reports earlier that Arcadia was working on turnaround plans suggested that formal talks with shop landlords were expected to begin in the next few weeks. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. The news comes just weeks after Baroness Karren Brady resigned from Arcadia's parent company Taveta, following the emergence of harassment allegations against Sir Philip.

"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

"Sir Philip Green is working on a restructuring of his Arcadia Group retail empire that includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge. The billionaire's company said in a statement that it was suffering ""an exceptionally challenging retail market"" in the UK. Arcadia was therefore ""exploring options"" to bolster the business. Job cuts and store closures are likely, but they would not be ""significant"", Arcadia insisted. There were reports on Friday that Sir Philip was considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that would enable him to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Arcadia said that it was issuing its statement in response to that media speculation, but made no mention about a CVA nor potential sales. ""Within an exceptionally challenging retail market and given the continued pressures that are specific to the UK high street we are exploring several options to enable the business to operate in a more efficient manner,"" Arcadia said. ""None of the options being explored involve a significant number of redundancies or store closures. The business continues to operate as usual including all payments being made to suppliers as normal,"" it added. CVAs can be used to cut shop rent bills, and other costs, but they are controversial and when House of Fraser used the arrangement it sparked a huge legal battle with landlords. News that one of the UK's biggest fashion retail groups is struggling comes after a string of High Street names hit financial trouble. Debenhams, New Look, Mothercare, House of Fraser, HMV and LK Bennett are among a roll-call of retailers hit by weak consumer confidence, higher costs, and the growth of online rivals. Philip Green 'paid harassment accuser Â£1m' Karren Brady quits Philip Green's empire Philip Green's Topshop facing boycott Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers. Arcadia also owns Evans and Wallis. Last year Sir Philip was embroiled in claims - strongly denied - of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. The reports earlier that Arcadia was working on turnaround plans suggested that formal talks with shop landlords were expected to begin in the next few weeks. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. The news comes just weeks after Baroness Karren Brady resigned from Arcadia's parent company Taveta, following the emergence of harassment allegations against Sir Philip.

"This video can not be played Christchurch was put into lockdown as events unfolded A gunman opened fire in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more. As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. This series of events has, once again, shone a spotlight on how sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit try - and fail - to address far-right extremism on their platforms. Attacks mapped What is known about the suspects? As the video continued to spread, other members of the public put up their own posts pleading with people to stop sharing it. One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. About 10 to 20 minutes before the attack in New Zealand, someone posted on the /pol/section of 8chan, a message board popular with the alt-right. The post included links to the suspect's Facebook page, where he stated he would be live-streaming and published a rambling and hate-filled document That document was, asBellingcat analyst Robert Evans points out,external, filled with ""huge amounts of content, most of it ironic, low-quality trolling"" and memes, in order to distract and confuse people The suspect also referenced a meme in the actual video. Before opening fire he shouted ""subscribe to PewDiePie"", a reference toa meme about keeping YouTube star PewDiePie as the most-subscribed-to channel on the platform,external. PewDiePiehas been embroiled in a race row before, so some have speculated that the attacker knew that mentioning him would provoke a reaction online. PewDiePie later said on Twitter he was ""absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person"" The attacks were live-streamed on Facebook and, despite the original being taken down, were quickly replicated and shared widely on other platforms, including YouTube and Twitter People continue to report seeing the video, despite the sites acting pretty swiftly to remove the original and copies, and copies are still being uploaded to YouTube faster than it can remove them Several Australian media outlets broadcast some of the footage, as did other major newspapers around the world Ryan Mac, a BuzzFeed technology reporter,,externalhas created a timeline of where he has seen the video, including it being shared from a verified Twitter account with 694,000 followers. He claims it has been up for two hours While huge numbers of people have been duplicating and sharing the footage online, many others responded with disgust - urging others not only not to share the footage, but not even to watch it. Spreading the video, many said, was what the attacker had wanted people to do. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The website later removed the document, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Daily Mirror editor Lloyd Embley also tweeted that they had removed the footage, and that publishing it was""not in line with our policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos"",external. All of the social media firms have sent heartfelt sympathy to the victims of the mass shootings, reiterating that they act quickly to remove inappropriate content. Facebook said: ""New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we removed both the shooter's Facebook account and the video. ""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand Police as their response and investigation continues.""

In terms of what they have done historically to combat the threat of far-right extremists, the social media companies' approach has been more chequered. Twitter acted to remove alt-right accounts in December 2017. Previously it has removed and then reinstated the account of Richard Spencer, an American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right"". Facebook, which suspended Mr Spencer's account in April 2018, admitted at the time that it was difficult to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political speech. Agonising wait for victims' families UK mosque security to be discussed This month, YouTube was accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible for its handling of a video promoting the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. British MP Yvette Cooper said the video-streaming platform had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the service. Dr Ciaran Gillespie, a political scientist from Surrey University, thinks the problem goes far deeper than a video, shocking as that content has been. ""It is not just a question about broadcasting a massacre live. The social media platforms raced to close that down and there is not much they can do about it being shared because of the nature of the platform, but the bigger question is the stuff that goes before it,"" he said. At least 49 people were killed in the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch As a political researcher, he uses YouTube ""a lot"" and says that he is often recommended far-right content. ""There is oceans of this content on YouTube and there is no way of estimating how much. YouTube has dealt well with the threat posed by Islamic radicalisation, because this is seen as clearly not legitimate, but the same pressure does not exist to remove far-right content, even though it poses a similar threat. ""There will be more calls for YouTube to stop promoting racist and far-right channels and content."" His views are echoed by Dr Bharath Ganesh, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""Taking down the video is obviously the right thing to do, but social media sites have allowed far-right organisations a place for discussion and there has been no consistent or integrated approach to dealing with it. ""There has been a tendency to err on the side of freedom of speech, even when it is obvious that some people are spreading toxic and violent ideologies."" Now social media companies need to ""take the threat posed by these ideologies much more seriously"", he added. ""It may mean creating a special category for right-wing extremism, recognising that it has global reach and global networks."" Neither under-estimate the magnitude of the task, especially as many of the exponents of far-right views are adept at, what Dr Gillespie calls, ""legitimate controversy"". ""People will discuss the threat posed by Islam and acknowledge it is contentious but point out that it is legitimate to discuss,"" he said. These grey areas are going to be extremely difficult for the social media firms to tackle, they say, but after the tragedy unfolding in New Zealand, many believe they must try harder.

"Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court on Saturday in relation to the mosque attacks The main suspect in the killings of 49 people in shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday has appeared in court on a single murder charge. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, was brought to the dock in a white prison shirt and handcuffs. Further charges are expected to be made against him. PM Jacinda Ardern said Mr Tarrant had a firearms licence and owned five guns, adding: ""Our gun laws will change."" Two others are in custody. None of those detained had a criminal record. Mr Tarrant was described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist"". The suspect, who stood silently during the brief hearing in Christchurch, was remanded in custody without a plea and is due to appear in court again on 5 April. The court judge ruled that the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs and filming to preserve his fair trial rights. Reaction to the attacks How attacks unfolded The victims and missing Ms Ardern called the attack ""an act of terror"", and officials are still carrying out the identification of the victims. Ms Ardern said the guns used by the attacker appeared to have been modified, and that the suspect's car was full of weapons, suggesting ""his intention to continue with his attack"". Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, she said the suspect had obtained a gun licence in November 2017 that allowed him to buy the weapons used in the attack. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern: NZ ""gun laws will change... now is the time"" ""The mere fact... that this individual had acquired a gun licence and acquired weapons of that range, then obviously I think people will be seeking change, and I'm committing to that."" New Zealand's Attorney-General David Parker said the government would look into banning semi-automatic weapons, but that no final decision had been made. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws in a country with a strong gun lobby and culture of hunting have failed. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Christchurch All day on Saturday the people of Christchurch have been turning out to show their rejection of the hate that inspired Friday's horrific attacks. In ones and twos and in family groups, people have been coming by the hundred to a makeshift memorial set up on the edge of Hagley Park. Outside the two mosques that were attacked, people have been laying more flowers. Many have left hand-written notes. ""This is not New Zealand,"" one read. At one point a group of young men started quietly singing a traditional Maori song, their heads bowed, eyes closed. The mayor of Christchurch said the killer had come to the city with hate in his heart, to perform an act of terrorism. But she said he did not represent anything about the city. Still, there are lots of uncomfortable questions for the authorities here. The man now in custody, Brenton Tarrant, made no secret of his support for white supremacy. He had reportedly been planning the attacks for months. And yet he was not on any police watch list. He did not have any trouble getting a gun licence, nor in buying a collection of high-powered weapons. This video can not be played Linwood imam: We still love this country The suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand,"" Ms Ardern said, without formally identifying him. She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" More about the suspects Witnesses 'prayed for end to bullets' Before the attacks, social media accounts in the name of Brenton Tarrant were used to post a lengthy, racist document in which the author identified the mosques that were later attacked. The text is called The Great Replacement, a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. The man said he had began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. The suspect sent the document to 70 people,external, including to Ms Ardern's generic address, less than 10 minutes before the attack, the New Zealand Herald reports. The minimum legal age to own a gun is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons All gun owners must have a licence but most individual weapons do not have to be registered, one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want More on the country's gun laws Relatives and friends have confirmed the identities of several victims, including: Daoud Nabi, 71, who is believed to have thrown himself in front of other people in the mosque to protect them Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Hosne Ara, 42, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived Pakistan's foreign ministry named six of its nationals who were killed,external, and said another three missing were still being identified. Ms Ardern said financial support would be made available to those who had lost someone on whom they were financially dependent. A total of 48 people were wounded and 11 are said to be in a critical condition in hospital. Omar Nabi holds a phone with a picture of his father Daoud outside the court building Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel expressed ""revulsion"" at this ""act of terrorism"", saying: ""We have welcomed new people into our city. They're our friends, they're our neighbours."" Muslims make up about 1.1% of New Zealand's population of 4.25 million, according to the latest census figures. Numbers rose sharply as the country took in refugees from various war-torn countries since the 1990s. The first report of an attack came from the Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch during Friday prayers at 13:40 (00:40 GMT). A gunman drove to the mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. He fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. Social media's role in attack Anger and solidarity at UK gathering The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to another mosque in the suburb of Linwood where the second shooting occurred. Police say they recovered firearms from both mosques, and explosive devices were found in a car belonging to one of the suspects.

"A 29-year-old man died at the scene before paramedics arrived A 29-year-old man has been stabbed to death in a fight in south-west London. He was stabbed at the junction of Gowan Avenue and Munster Road in Fulham in the early hours of Saturday and died at the scene. Neighbours said they heard an argument unfolding at 00:30 GMT, before police and paramedics arrived. A friend of the victim's described him as a ""good and big man"" and said: ""At the age of 29, you don't do silly things like this, knife crimes."" The friend, who asked not to be named, said he was not aware of any similar violent incidents in the residential area but added: ""There might have been a stabbing in this area, don't get me wrong, but they are normally with kids, not people our age."" Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham, said he had thanked the local ""hero"" who gave CPR to the victim and also thanked a group of girls from New Zealand who had stopped to help.

"Tommy Robinson, in court under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, said he was told to leave a pub by police English Defence League (EDL) founder Tommy Robinson has lost his legal challenge claiming police harassed him. Appearing in court under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, 36, was asked to move on from a Cambridge pub following a football match in August 2016. He said Cambridgeshire Police had targeted him ""because of his beliefs"". Judge Karen Walden-Smith said there was ""no evidence that Mr Lennon was being treated differently because of his beliefs about fundamentalist Islam."" His harassment claim was heard at Peterborough County Court. Sgt Paul Street, who asked Mr Yaxley-Lennon to move on from the pub, told the court he did not know what Tommy Robinson looked like and thought the name referred to an ""'80s football hooligan"". He said he moved Mr Yaxley-Lennon on due to intelligence that he was a football supporter likely to cause trouble, and was with a group of other ""risk"" supporters. Giving her judgement following a four-day hearing, Ms Walden-Smith said: ""Mr Lennon isn't as well-known as he and his supporters may think."" Ms Walden-Smith ruled that all of his claims, including several under the Human Rights Act, had failed. Mr Yaxley-Lennon said he had been with his three children, aged between five and nine at the time, on a family day out to see Luton Town play Cambridge United. He was with his three young children at the time and was not dressed for a fight, his lawyer said Alison Gurden, representing the 36-year-old, said Sgt Street ""didn't take into account factors that he should have done"". ""It wasn't necessary [to move him on] as there was... nothing to indicate Mr Lennon was likely to become involved in disorder,"" she said. ""He's there with his children and he's certainly not dressed for a fight, he's in his flip-flops."" She said Mr Yaxley-Lennon believed he was ""discriminated against on the grounds of being Tommy Robinson and his beliefs"". When the judge read out her decision, there was a shout of ""the law's an ass"" from the public gallery and Mr Yaxley-Lennon said the judgment reflected the ""entire corrupt system"". The judge ordered that Mr Yaxley-Lennon pay Â£20,000 towards the defendant's costs. Mr Yaxley-Lennon said outside court that he would appeal against the judgement.

"The BBC is running a week of news stories about Bradford on TV, radio and online on national and regional outlets Bradford is a global city, home to a population of more than 500,000 people and 150 different languages. The BBC'sWe Are Bradford projectis telling some of its stories. The city is already known as an industrial revolution boom town that gave the world textiles. And its reputation for some of the finest curry restaurants in the UK is secure. But Bradford's legacy extends wider than that. What else defines Bradford? Scotch barley broth was spooned out at Green Lane Primary by head teacher Jonathan Priestley, father of Bradford writer JB Priestley Bradford is believed to have been the first UK city to offer its poor children free school meals. The first meal, of scotch barley broth and fruit tart, was served to pupils at Green Lane Primary School in Manningham on 28 October 1907. Although records show Manchester provided some dinners for ""destitute and poorly nourished children"" as early as 1879, it's thought Bradford was the first city to offer an organised service for all pupils. The scheme was set up after campaigners Fred Jowett and Margaret McMillan highlighted the high levels of poverty and malnourishment among the city's children. ""At the time there was a great depression in Bradford and the needs of the hungry were only being met by charity,"" says Si Cunningham, of the Bradford Civic Society. ""Fred Jowett and Margaret McMillan saw this as a real injustice so started a public campaign - they thought education was a waste of money if children were hungry."" Teachers immediately noted an improvement in the children's physical health and behaviour, with Jowett, then MP for Bradford West, pushing for a national school meals programme. Pressure on the government prompted the passing of the Education (Provision of Meals) Act, with local authorities given grants to fund half the cost of meals. Prof David Sharpe demonstrating the Bradford sling with BBC Countryfile's John Craven Prof David Sharpe was a newly-qualified plastic surgeon when a fire broke out at Bradford City's Valley Parade ground on 11 May 1985, killing 56 people. He treated many of the injured in the immediate aftermath and went on to treat more than 200 people who suffered burns in the disaster. While treating the injured he found it was crucial to keep swelling down by keeping the hand elevated. However, conventional fabric arm slings did not do this when a patient was lying in a bed with other injuries. In the weeks after the fire, a plastic surgery and burns research unit was founded at the University of Bradford to develop new treatments. Prof Sharpe, who was the director of the unit until retiring in 2013, developed the ""Bradford sling"" while working there. Made from foam and Velcro straps, the simple design aids recovery, applies even pressure over the arm and can either be suspended beside the bed of the patient, or can be held against the patient's body. Ajay Mahajan, who took over as unit director, says it was used ""after every hand operation"". ""It's a very simple device that emanated from Bradford and has revolutionised the management of hand injuries or operations worldwide."" Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was convinced the photographs were genuine After borrowing her father's camera, teenager Elsie Wright and her young cousin Frances used paper cut-outs and hatpins to create some ""supernatural"" friends. The 1917 images, taken near a stream at the end of her garden in the suburban village of Cottingley, show Frances with four dancing fairies and Elsie seated with a dancing gnome. Years before other famous photographic frauds such as the Loch Ness Monster or Big Foot, it's thought the images were simply an elaborate bid for the children to deflect blame for their muddy clothes. Geoff Belknap, head curator at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, says: ""It's easy to look back now and say they're obviously faked, but remember there was no television and it was a very different visual world at that point."" We Are Bradford Amputee Marine breaks Atlantic row record Sinkhole-prone city gets 3D map A public controversy ensued, with leading scientists and writers voicing their opinions in support of and against their authenticity. World War One was nearing its end when the photographs were taken, with people ""wanting to believe"" in the supernatural at the time to connect with killed loved ones, Mr Belknap says. ""They bring up many questions overlapping with modern fears connected to the media and trust."" Frances always maintained the fairies were real but in 1983, five years before her death, Elsie admitted they had been faked. Trolleybuses were a common sight in Bradford for more than 60 years, from June 1911 to March 1972 During the early 20th Century, a web of overhead wires was strung above Bradford's streets to help introduce a flexible, quick and affordable form of mass transportation to the city. Its aging Victorian tramway system had seen a decline in use and local politicians were reluctant to invest in it any further, so had looked abroad for inspiration. ""Many towns had shown an interest in improving transport and introducing new technology, but it was Bradford and Leeds who were most determined,"" says Lauren Padgett, of the Bradford Industrial Museum. ""A delegation went to the continent to investigate European cities with trolleybus systems."" The vehicles, painted distinctively in blue and cream, became an institution in the city, with journeys sometimes delayed when the trolley poles fell off the overhead wires. ""It usually happened if trolleybuses were going too fast when approaching switches, with drivers reconnecting them using an insulated pole,"" the assistant curator said. Despite being quieter and greener than motorbuses, eventually the demand for new routes became too great for the trolleybus and it was fully replaced by its diesel-powered counterpart by 1972. The Manningham side won the first ever Rugby Football League championship when it was known as the Northern Union Bradford rugby club Manningham were a talented side who went down in history as the first ever champions of the Rugby Football League in 1896. But only seven years later, the shape of the ball changed when the club's owners decided to ditch the region's most popular sport and relaunch as football side, Bradford City AFC. ""The club started to suffer financially and soccer was becoming a hugely popular sport, much like it is today,"" says sports historian Tony Collins. ""The people running Manningham were ambitious and thought the best way to boost the city on a national stage was to switch."" After pledging allegiance to the beautiful game, the club stood the test of time and Bradford City are still competing - in the third tier of English football - 116 years later. ""It was the first time a team was admitted to the Football League without ever playing a match,"" Mr Collins adds. Gold, starring one of Bollywood's biggest stars Akshay Kumar, was partly filmed in Bradford Despite lacking the glamour of Los Angeles or a world-renowned film festival like Cannes or Venice, Bradford defied the odds to be named the world's first Unesco City of Film 10 years ago. Its successful pitch was said to be down to its film heritage, its regular use as a location for recording and the city's National Media Museum, now called the National Science and Media Museum. Bradford filmmaker Suman Hanif says the title has given her home city added weight in the creative industries for the past decade. ""It's empowered many local filmmakers to gain international recognition for films right here in the city,"" she says. ""The organisation has also attracted many great films and TV productions to the city, which has resulted in a better media representation of the north of England."" It gave Bradford a place within Creative Cities Network, which boasts 180 locations across the globe and encourages business and education links. After forming close ties with Qingdao, a fellow City of Film, plans are in place to film a Chinese adaptation of Bronte classic Jane Eyre shot in both China and West Yorkshire. The production team for the 2018 film Gold, featuring Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, set up their base in the city for three months and recruited locals to get involved. David Wilson, director of Bradford Unesco City of Film, says: ""The people of Bradford got to be extras in this epic production, so moments like this really add a buzz, and spreads the word that it's an exciting place to be.""

"This video can not be played Senator McConnell supports the president; Speaker Pelosi warns it sets a dangerous precedent Democratic and Republican politicians have sharply criticised President Trump's plan to use emergency powers to pay for a border wall with Mexico. Mr Trump is due to declare the emergency shortly in an attempt to bypass Congress, which has refused to approve $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for the wall. Senior Democrats accused the president of a ""gross abuse of power"". Several Republicans also voiced concern. Building a border wall was a key pledge in Mr Trump's election campaign. Declaring a national emergency would give Mr Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. All you need to know about the US border in seven charts Reaction to Trump's decision to declare national emergency Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? The president agreed on Thursday to sign a spending bill that does not include finance for the wall. Disagreement over the issue led to a 35-day government shutdown early this year - the longest in US history. The spending bill is due to be signed shortly to avert another shutdown. Citing unnamed White House officials, US media outlets reported that the president would sign the emergencies act at the same time. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it - and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential contender and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Maine Susan Collins, who said the move was of ""dubious constitutionality"". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. ""The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. She said Mr Trump would ""take other executive action - including a national emergency - to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border"". The compromise legislation was approved in an 83-16 vote in the Senate on Thursday. The House of Representatives later also backed the measure, by 300 to 128. The package includes $1.3bn in funding for border security, including physical barriers, but it does not allot money towards Mr Trump's wall. Trump's border wall in seven charts How much of the wall is built already? Speaking on the Senate floor on Thursday, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated his support for the president's national emergency move, saying the president was taking action with ""whatever tools he can legally use to enhance his efforts to secure the border"".Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer issued a strongly worded joint statement condemning the move. ""Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,"" read the statement. ""He couldn't convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he's trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it."" Ms Pelosi had already suggested that Democrats would mount a legal challenge. A month ago, in the midst of the federal government shutdown crisis, a consensus had emerged that the easiest way out for the president was to back down from his demands for congressional border wall appropriations while declaring a ""national emergency"" to commandeer funds from other sources. It took a while, but the path of least resistance is the one Donald Trump is following. He has extricated himself from a predicament of his own making, while taking action that he can cite to supporters as evidence that he's fulfilling his ""build the wall"" campaign promise. Of course, the drawbacks to this course that were apparent in January are still there. Republicans fear this will set a precedent for presidential power that Democrats can someday use to circumvent the will of Congress. The emergency declaration is sure to get bogged down in court challenges, which means it may not have much tangible benefit anytime soon. And, as much as the president may like to spin this as a victory by other means, he still backed down in the face of Democratic resistance in Congress. The shutdown fight was always about more than just the wall - it was a battle over who would set the political agenda for the next two years of the Trump presidency. And if this resolution is any indication, if the president wants to get his way he's largely going to have to find ways around Congress, not through it. The National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Mr Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts. The largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. Declaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. ""It's extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,"" Andrew Boyle, an attorney in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told the Associated Press news agency. The National Emergencies Act explained Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. ""It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past,"" said the Republican senator Ron Johnson.

"Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans The prosecution of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield was ""breathtakingly unfair"" as he was made to take the blame for others, a jury has heard. Ben Myers QC made the claim in his closing speech at Preston Crown Court in defence of the 74-year-old. He denies gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans, on 15 April 1989. Mr Myers also said ""it must be one of the most heartbreaking cases ever to come before an English court"". He said it was obvious now, but not then, of the dangers of putting large numbers of people in confined spaces in pens. Football was plagued by hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s and was a ""world away"" from today's game, he said. ""It affected how police planned the event and how they would react as matters unfolded."" He said it was ""humbling"" to be addressing the court ""because of the scale of the case and the scale of the loss"". The barrister told the jury failings at Hillsborough included faulty police radios, poor signage, a reduction in police manpower and stadium structure - none of which was Mr Duckenfield's fault. He said his client was an ""excellent police officer"" who less than three weeks to prepare for the game after being promoted. ""He was faced with something that no-one had foreseen, no-one had planned for and no-one could deal with."" Mr Myers said the jury was being invited to ""give him criminal responsibility for a decade of incompetence on the part of others"". The barrister told the court the case against his client, who chose not to give evidence, was heavily based on hindsight, adding: ""In the real world you get one go."" He said the Hillsborough stadium ""was potentially lethal"" and there had been a ""history of near-misses"". ""It's like giving a captain a ship that's already sinking and judging him on how well he sails it,"" Mr Myers added. ""The system he was working with was riddled with system faults. It's not a fair start."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster At one point he turned to the defendant and said: ""Look at him now. Someone has to stand up for him. We do that, and we do it with vigour. He is an ageing man and not in the best of health."" Mr Myers said it would be ""very wrong indeed"" to convict Mr Duckenfield ""as a way of expressing"" sympathy over what happened. Mr Myers also said it was ""utterly wrong and deeply unfair"" that the jury was shown video footage of the disaster by the prosecution. He said: ""It is not right to bridge evidential gaps with emotion and strong feeling."" On Thursday, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" and should have made ""lifesaving decisions"". Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety Act. The trial continues.
