"This video can not be played Eleven-month-old Charlie Gard was at the centre of a legal battle over his treatment Charlie Gard, the baby at the centre of a legal row over his treatment, has died, a family spokesman has confirmed. The 11-month-old was moved to a hospice following a High Court ruling. He suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness. His parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, fought a lengthy legal battle with Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) to allow him to be taken to the US for treatment. But on Monday they dropped their legal battle after Prof Michio Hirano, the American neurologist who had offered to treat him, said it was too late for it to work. The tragic case of Charlie Gard In a statement issued on Friday evening, Ms Yates said: ""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I am deeply saddened by the death of Charlie Gard. My thoughts and prayers are with Charlie's parents Chris and Connie at this difficult time."" Pope Francis tweeted: ""I entrust little Charlie to the Father and pray for his parents and all those who loved him."" GOSH said it sent its ""heartfelt condolences"" to Charlie's parents and loved ones. US Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted: ""Saddened to hear of the passing of Charlie Gard. Karen & I offer our prayers & condolences to his loving parents during this difficult time."" Chris Gard and Connie Yates fought a five-month legal battle on behalf of their son On Thursday, Ms Yates said the couple had been denied their ""final wish"" to have more time with him after a High Court judge ruled that he would be moved to a hospice and have his life support withdrawn soon after. The couple had wanted to take their son to the US for nucleoside bypass therapy, but specialists at GOSH said the treatment was experimental and that Charlie had irreversible brain damage.

Hundreds of people - called Charlie's Army - lent their support to his parents, who raised Â£1.35m to take him to the US for treatment. The couple fought a legal battle for five months, in which judges from the High Court, Supreme Court and the European Court all agreed with doctors that the treatment would not benefit Charlie. Charlie's plight attracted the attention of Pope Francis and US president Donald Trump. Charlie has been in intensive care since October Following the European Court ruling, thePope said he was following the case""with affection and sadness"". In a statement released earlier this month, the Vatican said: ""For them he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored."" The US president then offered his support, tweeting: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."" After his tweet, Prof Hirano co-signed a letter with other medical experts which suggested unpublished data showed therapy could improve Charlie's brain condition. They claimed that ""ideally"" the treatment would first be tested on mice but said that, in Charlie's case, there was no time for such a trial. After examining Charlie a couple of weeks ago, Prof Hirano said it was too late for the treatment to work. An MRI scan had shown there was no muscle at all in parts of his body. HIs parents have described him as an ""absolute warrior"" Paying tribute to their son following the end of their legal challenge the couple, both in their 30s and of Bedfont, west London, had described him as an ""absolute warrior"". On Monday Mr Gard said: ""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you. ""We had the chance but we weren't allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight our beautiful little boy."" 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 4 July: The Vatican's children's hospital in Rome offers to take in Charlie 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court 10 July: Charlie's parents return to the High Court and ask Mr Justice Francis to carry out a fresh analysis of the case.

"This video can not be played Trump praises Priebus after announcing his departure US President Donald Trump has named General John Kelly, who currently heads the Department of Homeland Security, as his next chief of staff. The announcement, made on Twitter on Friday afternoon, removes Reince Priebus from the role. The embattled former chief of staff had faced pressure since being named as a possible leaker by Mr Trump's newly appointed director of communication. Mr Priebus told CNN he resigned on Thursday after talking with Mr Trump. ""The president wanted to go in a different direction,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, adding that he thought Gen Kelly was ""a brilliant pick"". Allow Twitter content?

Anthony Scaramucci, who was appointed communications director one week ago, had accused Mr Priebus - a Republican Party stalwart - of leaking to the press. He also phoned a reporter to unleash a profanity-filled rant against Mr Priebus, whom he called a ""paranoid schizophrenic"". The people around Donald Trump This video can not be played The feud between Priebus and Scaramucci decoded Gen Kelly is a retired general who has become the face of border security. In a series of tweets just before 17:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, the president praised the former Marine Corps general as a ""great American"" and a ""great leader"". ""John has done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my administration,"" said the president. He will start work on Monday, a White House spokesperson says. Gen Kelly's deputy, Elaine Duke, will become acting head of the Department of Homeland Security. the former four-star general had a military career spanning four decades he is the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan son Robert, a first lieutenant in the Marines, was killed in combat when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010 at Homeland Security, was responsible for border, immigration, cyber hacking, airport security and natural disaster management In a third tweet, President Trump praised the outgoing chief of staff, who had previously worked as the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). ""I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him,"" he said. In his previous role as RNC chairman, he acted as a bridge between the Republican nominee and a party establishment that was often uncomfortable with its own presidential standard-bearer. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Was there really any doubt who Donald Trump was going to side with in the Priebus-Scaramucci feud? The newly appointed communications director took dead aim at the chief of staff online and on-air this week, calling him a ""paranoid schizophrenic"". Well, as the saying goes, even paranoids have enemies. On Friday afternoon the axe fell. With Priebus's departure, the purge of establishment Republicans within the Trump White House is in full swing. The former head of the Republican National Committee was brought in as a veteran Washington player to help bridge the insider-outsider gap in the administration, but instead he tumbled into the chasm. It's clear, in tweets and comments, that Mr Trump believes the Republican Party does not have his best interests in mind. Now he's cutting the party loose. By all accounts Priebus's successor, John Kelly, is a well liked, highly respected man. His selection is yet another example of Mr Trump's preference for military brass in positions of authority. His managerial skills will be sorely tested, however, by a White House staff that has been wracked by internal strife. Leading an army into battle may seem easy by comparison. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think the administration's relationship with the Republican Party would be affected by Mr Priebus's exit. ""I think we've still got a good relationship. We're going to continue working with the party and doing what we came here to do,"" she said. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a close friend of Mr Priebus and a fellow Republican, said he had served ""the president and the American people capably and passionately"". ""He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend,"" he said.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Collins: ""Windows have been smashed open"" Fireworks and bottles were hurled at riot police as a protest following the death of a black man turned violent. Rashan Charles, 20,died after being apprehended by policein Dalston, east London, on 22 July. Earlier, a peaceful protest took place at Stoke Newington police station which Scotland Yard said was separate. Angry clashes broke out on Friday evening after protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. Some of the protestors carried Black Lives Matter placards. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating his death. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Rashan Charles Mr Charles's father, Esa, gave a statement outside Stoke Newington police station. He was joined by the father of Edir Da Costa, who it is claimedwas ""brutally beaten"" by Met officersin June. That death is also being investigated by the police watchdog. Police warned that anyone using Saturday's events ""as an excuse to commit crime"" would be ""dealt with robustly"". Bins, mattresses and debris were in flames At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackneytweeted,external: ""Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."" Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston Videos on social media showed officers walking backwards as objects were thrown at them. Several wheelie bins were set alight and mattresses thrown on top of the burning pile. Shop windows were also smashed, littering the streets with glass, with those involved described by an eyewitness as ""very, very angry"". A lorry drove through a barricade in Kingsland Road with people clinging to it Police in Hackney said they were ""subjected to abuse and violence"" The crowd dispersed at about 23:40 BST, the Met said. A 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He was taken to an east London police station where he remains in custody. The Met said a police officer injured his eye and a member of the public was knocked off his bike and assaulted as he tried to pass through the protest. Det Supt Claire Crawley, from Hackney Borough, said: ""The disorder of last night was separate from the peaceful protest at Stoke Newington Police Station that was held earlier that day."" She added: ""We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated."" One man who was at the demonstration told the BBC the protesters were ""angry and confused"" because they were ""not being represented"". He suggested young people were ""living in fear"", adding they ""don't understand how to live, how to make money, how to work for what they want"", with some ""forced into"" situations such as selling drugs or carrying knives. Protesters also gathered outside Stoke Newington police station on Monday Shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott said: ""The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. ""But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful."" Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, said the community intended to hold peaceful protests, but some people from outside the borough wanted to ""engage in vandalism and unrest"". ""What we've tried to do all week is separate the two groups, to recognise the rawness of the anger out in the community,"" he said. Mr Glanville said he did not think there was a problem between the police and the community, as a lot of work had been carried out in the area following the 2011 riots. Police officers were seen retreating as objects were thrown at them Riot police had fireworks and bottles thrown at them The IPCC said ""we understand the concerns raised following Rashan's death"". A statement added: ""We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality, and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have.""

"Images taken by Bristol Port's hydrographic team have revealed the wreck A sunken ship has been discovered after more than 100 years buried under the shifting sands of the Bristol Channel. The Brunswick sank on Christmas Eve 1900 as it approached Bristol, with the loss of seven lives. Images taken by Bristol Port's hydrographic team have revealed the wreck of the cargo vessel. Its secrets are likely to remain protected as it is already being reburied by sand and sediments. The Brunswick was a British screw steamer built in Glasgow in 1898 and ran regularly delivering cargo between Liverpool and Bristol. Areport revealed it sank,externalat about 5:30 GMT on 24 December after running aground in thick fog as it approached Black Nore Point, near Portishead. The wreck is already being reburied by the shifting sands of the Bristol Channel The Brunswick sank as it approached Black Nore Point, near Portishead The court hearing in January 1901 was ""of the opinion that it was caused by the vessel grounding on a very steep bank, which gave her a heavy list, and so subjected her to a strong flood tide setting broadside on her starboard bilge"". Seven men drowned and the master of the ship, John Richard Wade, was criticised for not slowing down or asking for an extra lookout ""instead of going on blindly at full speed as he appears to have done"". A Bristol Port team, which was carrying out a routine survey of the channel, has now spotted the wreck 117 years later. John Chaplin from the Bristol Port company, said the discovery was the first of its type he had experienced in 17 years. ""The dynamic nature of the estuary means the sands and sediments are shifting all the time,"" he added. ""It just happened that this wreck has been exposed as we were surveying the area."" A second site visit has revealed that the wreck is already being covered again.

"A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket. Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby. Mayor Olaf Scholz said the attack was motivated by ""hate"" but did not say it was a terror attack. There are unconfirmed reports that the man shouted ""Allahu akhbar"", Arabic for ""God is great"" while attacking people. Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality. Mr Sholz said he was a failed asylum seeker. The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers. Mobile phone footage on German media that is purportedly of the attack's aftermath shows several people chasing a man and throwing chairs at him. A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect. The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain. Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife. One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was. Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: ""We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."" Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed. One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed ""hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack"".

"Justene Reece took her own life as a ""direct result"" of Allen's actions A man has been jailed for 10 years for the manslaughter of his ex-girlfriend after she killed herself as a ""direct result"" of his controlling behaviour. Nicholas Allen was jailed after what is thought to be the first manslaughter case brought in such circumstances. Allen, 47, sent Justene Reece abusive voicemails, texts and Facebook messages and stalked her, the trial heard. Ms Reece, who was 46, hanged herself in February and left a note saying ""I've run out of fight."" Allen, who has a string of convictions for assault and harassment against other partners, was also convicted of ""controlling and coercive behaviour"" and of six counts of stalking Ms Reece and her family. For these he was further sentenced to three years, to run concurrently. On sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers QC said Allen had ""clearly caused"" Justene to commit suicide and made her life ""a living nightmare"". ""It is not suggested that you intended at any time that she should die but clearly you intended that she should suffer serious psychological harm. ""She committed suicide as a direct result of your sustained and determined criminal actions - actions which you clearly knew were having a profound effect upon her."" Senior Crown Prosecutor Hannah Sidaway said: ""This was an exceptional case.  Allen subjected Justene and those close to her to a sustained campaign of torment until she was unable to endure his behaviour any longer. ""There is no doubt he ultimately caused her to take her own life,"" she added. The court heard that after Allen found out about Ms Reece's death he looked online to see whether he could be held legally responsible. Ms Reece and Allen had known each other since they were teenagers because of their shared interest in scooters. They began a relationship in the summer of 2015 and later that year moved in together in Stafford. But the pair separated in October 2016 partly because of domestic abuse perpetrated by Allen, the court heard. Nicholas Allen was jailed for 10 years, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind Ms Reece told police Allen had become ""very manipulative, controlling and cold"". He had fitted a tracer to her scooter, was sending her hundreds of texts and messages when she went out, tracking her on social media and sometimes stopping her from going out. Prosecuting, Andrew Smith QC said: ""When Ms Reece tried to leave the house Mr Allen would physically throw her to the floor. ""On two separate occasions he put his hands around her neck and physically stopped her from leaving the house,"" he said. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Earlier this month, an inspection report found that harassment and stalking victims were being let down at every stage of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. But the bold decision to charge Nicholas Allen with manslaughter demonstrates an awareness of the devastating impact of such behaviour - and it may signify a step-change in the way the authorities deal with it. From a legal point of view, the case is extremely unusual. People convicted of manslaughter have usually physically caused the death, for example, pushing someone, who then falls and suffers a fatal head injury. It raises the prospect of other prosecutions, in cases where someone has taken their own life as a result of someone else's criminal actions. Ms Reece left Allen and moved into a women's refuge in another part of the country. But, the court heard, he became ""obsessed"" with finding her and tried to contact her 3,473 times in five and a half months. She obtained a non-molestation order, an injunction to prevent Allen from threatening or harming her, but he breached it within three days by trying to contact her through social media. ""With increasing frequency, Mr Allen continued to adopt false identities, in a variety of forms, in his stalking of Ms Reece and those closest to her,"" said Mr Smith. In November 2016, Ms Reece moved back to Stafford. At this point, she was taking medication for depression and rarely left her house. Allen got back in contact with her and told her he loved her, saying he was tracking her movements. Police warned Allen ""to cease all contact"" but he ignored them and tried to contact her with ""real intensity"" over Christmas. In January, Ms Reece found a near-identical Facebook profile to her own had been set up saying she had been raped some years earlier. Another fake account, also under her name, claimed she had blamed two innocent men for it. Later that month Ms Reece took an overdose in an attempt to take her own life. ""Medical records make clear that her taking of the overdose was directly linked to Mr Allen's actions in relation to both herself and her friends and family,"" said Mr Smith. In February, Allen was arrested for harassment. Ms Reece told police he was intimidating and harassing her ""to the point where I cannot now sleep"". She added: ""I am doing everything I can to keep myself and my friends and family safe but Allen just will not leave us alone."" Friends said she had gone from being a confident, ""bubbly"" woman to a ""skeleton"" who could not function. On 22 February, Ms Reece's body was found in the kitchen of her home. A consultant psychiatrist who reviewed all the evidence and medical records said she had been in a ""substantially abnormal"" mental state, suffering from depression, panic attacks and feelings of hopelessness. Mr Smith told the court the doctor had concluded there was a ""clear link between Ms Reece's mental state caused by the actions of the defendant and her taking her own life"". Ms Sidaway said: ""This case illustrates the devastating effect that stalking can have on victims.  It reaches into every aspect of their lives, causing acute distress and leaving them, and often their families, living in fear."" In a statement released by Staffordshire Police, Ms Reece's family said Allen's actions caused ""a dramatic transformation in Justene's personality and health"". ""She changed from a very bubbly and loving person to someone who was timid, afraid, lethargic, and frightened to leave the house. This was shocking to us all. We take some small comfort in the fact Nick Allen has now been convicted and sentenced for his actions.""

"A British man has been arrested as part of an anti-terror operation while on holiday in Turkey, the BBC has learned. Ex-soldier Joe Robinson, from Leeds, is understood to be accused of sharing material on social media from his time in Syria with Kurdish militia the YPG. Mr Robinson, 24, his Bulgarian fiancÃ© Mira Rojkan, and her mother Veselina, were detained in a police raid at the resort of Didim, western Turkey. The Foreign Office said it has requested consular access. The group's mobile phones, computer and other digital devices were seized by police. Ms Rojkan and her mother have now been released but friends told the BBC Mr Robinson remains under arrest and will appear in court on Monday. Mr Robinson, who is originally from Lancashire, spent five months fighting as a volunteer with the YPG against the so-called Islamic State group and has previously spoken about his experiencesin media reports.,external Although the YPG is not a proscribed group in the UK, Turkey views it as the extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). According to reports in Turkish media, the police operation was carried out against the PKK. Mr Robinson's mother Sharon Chimejczuk told the BBC: ""I just want my son home safe"". ""He has done nothing but help innocent civilians. His whole family are concerned for his wellbeing and urge the British authorities to help bring him home."" Mr Robinson spent five months fighting against IS with the Kurdish units the YPG Ms Rojkan, who lives with Mr Robinson in Leeds, said she was extremely distressed by her experience. She said she had been allowed to speak with her fiancÃ© since his arrest and he is very worried. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Rojkan said ""I just want the love of my life back. He's wanted to do nothing but help people. He doesn't deserve this."" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of the detention of a British national in Turkey and have requested consular access."" Mark Campbell from the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign said: ""Unfortunately, Joe has gone on holiday to Turkey not realising the kind of state it has now become.

"The couple were travelling on the Emerald Princess cruise ship (file picture) A man suspected of killing his wife while on a cruise ship in the US state of Alaska did so because ""she would not stop laughing"" at him, a witness says. Kenneth Manzanares has been charged with the murder of his 39-year-old wife, whose body was found with severe head wounds in their cabin. He was detained after security agents found blood on his hands and clothes, court documents said. Mr Manzanares' court-appointed public defender has not commented. The victim has been identified by US media as Kristy Manzanares, from Utah. A witness who entered the couple's cabin before the security agents said he saw the 39-year-old suspect dragging the victim's body to the balcony, the documents said. The witness then grabbed the woman's ankles and pulled her back in. When he asked Mr Manzanares what had happened, the man allegedly said: ""She would not stop laughing at me."" Later, during a search by FBI agents, the suspect said, according to the documents: ""My life is over."" The incident happened on Tuesday night on the Emerald Princess cruise ship, operated by Princess Cruises. It had departed with some 3,400 passengers from Seattle on Sunday for a week-long trip. Kristy Manzanares was described by her employer, Summit Sotheby's International Realty, as being a ""dedicated and loving mother who juggled her business schedule to make her children a top priority."" The FBI is investigating the case because it occurred in US waters. A spokesman said other family members were onboard the ship on the same trip, but details about them have not been released. Mr Manzanares made his first appearance in a federal court in Anchorage via video link from Juneau, where he was being held. A hearing has been scheduled for 10 August.

"Charlie Gard's death is the main news for the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Sun. The Mirror says his tragic story,externaltouched a nation. It was all the more poignant because there was never going to be a happy ending, the paper adds. Its headline quotes the statement issued by his parents: ""Our beautiful little boy has gone."" The Sun has the headline,external: ""RIP our hero"". The Mail says his death ends months of turmoil and court drama,externalin which Chris Gard and Connie Yates fought for treatment they hoped would save him. ""Rest in peace, Charlie,"" is the headline. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express lead on the chancellor's suggestion that there could be a transition period of up to three years after the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The Telegraph says Philip Hammond's comments,externalhave prompted alarm among Leave campaigners and some MPs. It says they fear that if Britain is still in a state of flux at the next election - in 2022 at the latest - Remain supporters will seize the chance to water down Brexit and even try to reverse the process. According to the Express,external, many Remainers hope a slow Brexit will mean that Leave supporters will lose heart, and a possible economic downturn could be used as an excuse to hold another referendum. For its main story, theGuardian says the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has set out the possibility,externalof the UK remaining within the EU, arguing that Brexit could be legitimately stopped if Labour included the pledge in an election manifesto or committed to a second referendum. It says his intervention is likely to fuel Labour divisions on Brexit, as the leadership is adamant that the party should respect last year's result but some MPs believe it should fight for a second referendum. The i newspaper reports that campaigners are calling on the government to come clean,externalover the costs of the HS2 rail project, after details of the budgets and timescales were obscured or redacted in official documents. It says the Stop HS2 group has accused Transport Secretary Chris Grayling of failing to back up his own claims that the project will be on time and on budget. The Department for Transport tells the paper that the redactions contain commercially sensitive information. The DfT later issued a statement in response to the story, saying it was ""keeping a tough grip on costs and the project is on time and on budget  at Â£55.7bn"".

Parents are being asked to monitor their children's transactions after the number of youths used by fraudsters and gangsters nearly doubled in a year, the paper adds. Finally, the smouldering wreck of a Â£260,000 Ferrari is pictured in most of the papers - because its owner managed to crash the car only an hour after he had collected it.

"Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan says he is ""disappointed and frustrated"" after the failed Senate vote Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is ""disappointed and frustrated"" by the Senate's failure to repeal the Obama-era healthcare act. He is among several lawmakers to express frustration after three Republican senators opposed a bill to scale back parts of the US health law. The so-called ""skinny"" repeal is the Senate's third failed attempt to roll back Obamacare. It is considered a blow to Republicans who vowed for years to repeal the law. The legislation fell apart during the early hours on Friday, when Arizona Senator John McCain cast the decisive vote to reject the bill by 51 to 49 in the Republican-dominated Senate. He joined Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in opposing the plan. An estimate from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found the ""skinny"" repeal would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026, with insurance premiums increasing by 20%. Mr Ryan said Republicans ""should not give up"" on the plan, but added that he would now turn his attention to overhauling the tax code. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, described the result as a ""disappointing moment"". He continued: ""It's time to move on."" Where Trump went wrong on healthcare This video can not be played Watch reactions to his ""no"" vote against repealing the Obama-era healthcare law Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks blamed Mr McConnell for the failure, telling CNN ""the leadership at the top is responsible. The buck stops there"". ""If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done on this, how is he going to get the job done on the rest of President Trump's agenda over the next three and a half years?"" he asked. Mr Brooks added that Mr McConnell should pressure the Senate to pass a new version of former President Barack Obama's signature law - the Affordable Care act - or step down. Iowa Congressman singled out Mrs Murkowski and Mr McCain for the loss. He said Mrs Murkowski ""was initially appointed to her position by her father"" and that her write-in campaign in 2010 ""was essentially a revolt"" against Republican primary voters. Mrs Murkowski was elected to her fourth term last year. Congressman Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, was among several lawmakers to share his disappointment on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

A spokesman for Mr Obama weighed in on the debate on Friday, praising those who ""mobilised, organised and made their voices heard"".

He also called Mrs Collins and Mrs Murkowksi tough women and said he spoke to Speaker Ryan on Friday about working on bipartisan legislation. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Instead of beating the drum for healthcare reform, the administration has been all over the map. A hastily announced ban on transgender individuals in the armed forces, issued by presidential tweet. A press conference to herald efforts to combat gang violence. A campaign-style rally in Ohio with a focus on the threats of illegal immigration. A speech to a Boy Scouts gathering that was heavy on media bashing. In case that wasn't enough, over the past week the administration has been beset by internecine warfare. Mr Trump publicly questioned the effectiveness of his former campaign confidant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, subjecting him to an increasingly angry barrage of tweets. Read Anthony in full The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare, including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more. It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations. Mr McCain cast the decisive vote to reject the so-called ""skinny"" repeal But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals. A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place. The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it. Mr McCainsaid,externalhe had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans. There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress. However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year. Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."" Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself. This video can not be played Mazie Hirono said she was one of the lucky ones with health insurance In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of ""collapse"", with healthcare premiums ""skyrocketing"" and providers ""fleeing the marketplace"". He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to ""return to the correct way of legislating"" with input from both parties. ""We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve,"" he said. But Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted the fight was not over. ""Mark my words, this journey is not yet done,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump praises Priebus after announcing his departure US President Donald Trump has named General John Kelly, who currently heads the Department of Homeland Security, as his next chief of staff. The announcement, made on Twitter on Friday afternoon, removes Reince Priebus from the role. The embattled former chief of staff had faced pressure since being named as a possible leaker by Mr Trump's newly appointed director of communication. Mr Priebus told CNN he resigned on Thursday after talking with Mr Trump. ""The president wanted to go in a different direction,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, adding that he thought Gen Kelly was ""a brilliant pick"". Allow Twitter content?

Anthony Scaramucci, who was appointed communications director one week ago, had accused Mr Priebus - a Republican Party stalwart - of leaking to the press. He also phoned a reporter to unleash a profanity-filled rant against Mr Priebus, whom he called a ""paranoid schizophrenic"". The people around Donald Trump This video can not be played The feud between Priebus and Scaramucci decoded Gen Kelly is a retired general who has become the face of border security. In a series of tweets just before 17:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, the president praised the former Marine Corps general as a ""great American"" and a ""great leader"". ""John has done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my administration,"" said the president. He will start work on Monday, a White House spokesperson says. Gen Kelly's deputy, Elaine Duke, will become acting head of the Department of Homeland Security. the former four-star general had a military career spanning four decades he is the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan son Robert, a first lieutenant in the Marines, was killed in combat when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010 at Homeland Security, was responsible for border, immigration, cyber hacking, airport security and natural disaster management In a third tweet, President Trump praised the outgoing chief of staff, who had previously worked as the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). ""I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him,"" he said. In his previous role as RNC chairman, he acted as a bridge between the Republican nominee and a party establishment that was often uncomfortable with its own presidential standard-bearer. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Was there really any doubt who Donald Trump was going to side with in the Priebus-Scaramucci feud? The newly appointed communications director took dead aim at the chief of staff online and on-air this week, calling him a ""paranoid schizophrenic"". Well, as the saying goes, even paranoids have enemies. On Friday afternoon the axe fell. With Priebus's departure, the purge of establishment Republicans within the Trump White House is in full swing. The former head of the Republican National Committee was brought in as a veteran Washington player to help bridge the insider-outsider gap in the administration, but instead he tumbled into the chasm. It's clear, in tweets and comments, that Mr Trump believes the Republican Party does not have his best interests in mind. Now he's cutting the party loose. By all accounts Priebus's successor, John Kelly, is a well liked, highly respected man. His selection is yet another example of Mr Trump's preference for military brass in positions of authority. His managerial skills will be sorely tested, however, by a White House staff that has been wracked by internal strife. Leading an army into battle may seem easy by comparison. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think the administration's relationship with the Republican Party would be affected by Mr Priebus's exit. ""I think we've still got a good relationship. We're going to continue working with the party and doing what we came here to do,"" she said. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a close friend of Mr Priebus and a fellow Republican, said he had served ""the president and the American people capably and passionately"". ""He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend,"" he said.

"This video can not be played 'We have to blame Republican leadership' Hollywood script-writers couldn't have staged it any better. At roughly 1:30 on Friday morning, John McCain approached the dais on the floor of the Senate. Votes on the latest Republican healthcare reform plan had mostly been recorded, and it was clear that the Arizona senator would be the difference between success and failure. Mr McCain held his right arm out, palm down. It was his good arm, the one not crippled by the plane crash in Vietnam that left him a prisoner of war for more than five years. After a pause he turned his hand, like a Roman emperor passing judgement at a gladiator match, and pointed his thumb toward the ground. ""No,"" he said, amid gasps and a smattering of applause by stunned - and jubilant - Democrats. For the first time in a long while, politics in Washington weren't at Veep-level absurdity or House of Cards intrigue. It was high drama, with a decorated hero playing the leading role. Senate 'skinny repeal' bill fails 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country This video can not be played Watch reactions to his ""no"" vote against repealing the Obama-era healthcare law Off to one side, New York Senator Chuck Schumer - leader of the Senate Democrats - waved for his side to stay calm. The enormity of Mr McCain's move was obvious, but he didn't want his party to be accused of gloating. The look in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's eyes, and the catch in his throat as he spoke after the gavel sounded the bill's death knell, said it all, however. This wasn't just a glancing blow - a temporary setback for reform efforts akin to the countless others that had occurred during the Obamacare repeal's winding legislative course. When Mr McCain lowered his thumb in the early hours of Friday, he was signalling the downward spiral of the president's legislative agenda. He was effectively passing judgement on the process and practice of this nascent administration. In a speech a few days earlier, he had criticised Washington in general and those who flout congressional traditions, but the message was clearly directed at the man sitting in the Oval Office. As he left the Senate after defeat of a bill he had voted for, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, was asked by a reporter what the next step is. ""There is no next step,"" he snapped. Why is Obamacare so controversial? This video can not be played Mazie Hirono said she was one of the lucky ones with health insurance In the hours after the bill died, social media buzzed with criticisms of how the Trump administration handled - or, rather, mishandled - the legislative push. Maybe Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke shouldn't have threatened Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski - an early no vote - with political retribution and cuts to federal funding to her home state. The senator had won re-election in 2010 as an independent write-in candidate after losing to a grass-roots conservative in the Republican primary. She was probably immune to angry Trump tweets or warnings of populist uprisings among her base. Maybe Susan Collins of Maine, the lone Republican to vote against Obamacare repeal back in 2015 when it was a symbolic effort, should have been brought into Senate legislative negotiations from the beginning, rather than shrugged off as an unneeded vote. Perhaps Mr Trump's tweet that Mr McCain was an American hero when he flew to Washington after brain surgery to vote on the healthcare bill wasn't enough to outweigh the time, two years ago, when candidate Trump questioned the Arizona senator's military heroism. Is Obamacare more popular than ever? Chuck Schumer, the leader of Democrats in the Senate, told his side to calm down In the end the White House's ""closing arguments"" for the Senate bill - a smattering of presidential tweets, a staged ""victims of Obamacare"" event and some last-minute lobbying by vice-president Mike Pence - weren't enough. Not nearly enough. Instead of beating the drum for healthcare reform, the administration had been all over the map. A hastily announced ban on transgender individuals in the armed forces, issued by presidential tweet. A press conference to herald efforts to combat gang violence. A campaign-style rally in Ohio with a focus on the threats of illegal immigration. A speech to a Boy Scouts gathering that was heavy on media bashing. In case that wasn't enough, over the past week the administration has been beset by internecine warfare. Mr Trump publicly questioned the effectiveness of his former campaign confidant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, subjecting him to an increasingly angry barrage of tweets. Mr Trump's newly installed communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, spent most of his time communicating his differences with White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus and other presidential aides in particularly colourful language. The president, we are told, thrives on chaos. As Mr Scaramucci likes to say, Mr Trump is a disruptor, sent to Washington to shake up the establishment. The disruption, however, is coming with a price. Although healthcare reform could always crawl its way out of the grave, that seems unlikely anytime soon. This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' The Senate has to move on to more pressing business - passing appropriations to keep the government running, raising the debt ceiling, and confirming the backlog of Trump's administrative and judicial appointments. Then there are the other Republican legislative priorities, tax reform in particular. The longer the party tilts at the healthcare windmill, the more unlikely any serious effort can be mounted before legislators have to turn their focus to re-election in the 2018 congressional mid-terms in November. Any talk of new legislative goals or efforts is of questionable utility, however, if the Trump White House doesn't learn some hard lessons from this recent failure. Stay focused and on message. Build relationships with sometimes prickly members of Congress. Don't assume that a president with approval ratings in the high 30s can bully recalcitrant opponents. On Friday morning Mr Trump tweeted about doing away with the legislative filibuster in the Senate, which requires 60 votes for the passage of major bills. On Friday morning, however, his party couldn't get to 50 with its bare-minimum ""skinny"" bill. Losers gripe about the rules of the game. Winners find a way to prevail. So far, winning for the Trump administration has been in short supply. 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country Has Trump managed to kill off Obamacare?

"Women should be told now when the tampon tax will be abolished, an MP has said, as the UK's largest supermarket announced a price cut for the products. Tesco said its 5% reduction on the cost of women's sanitary products would cover the VAT levied on these items. Labour MP Paula Sherriff, who has led the campaign for VAT to be cut to zero, said she hoped other retailers would follow suit. Most have promised to apply a price cut when VAT is reduced. The minimum VAT rate is set at EU level. The European Commission is aiming to bring in a zero rate for sanitary products in 2018. Deal reached to scrap 'tampon tax', officials say Row as tampon tax cash goes to anti-abortion charity Life Tesco is the first retailer to announce that it will cut its own prices before the headline tax rate has changed. Michelle McEttrick, Tesco's brand director, said: ""For many of our customers, tampons, panty liners and sanitary towels are essential products. ""However, the cost of buying them every month can add up, and for many women and girls it can be a real struggle on top of other essential items."" Paula Sherriff said she hoped other retailers would follow Tesco's lead Other major supermarkets and pharmacies have agreed in writing to reduce the cost of sanitary products when the VAT charge is reduced, following fears of a repeat of the situation in France where prices failed to fall following a VAT cut. Ms Sherriff said they could now follow Tesco's lead. ""It would have been completely unacceptable if abolishing the tampon tax had just led to big businesses boosting their bottom line at the expense of women buying what are essential goods, which is why we pushed the supermarkets to sign up to a deal to pass the cut on,"" she said. ""But this goes a step even further, by reducing prices right now - and I hope the other big retailers now consider doing the same. ""With retailers coming on board, the UK government and European leaders should set a clear timetable for the tampon tax to be abolished."" At present, the government spends the proceeds from the tax on sanitary products on women's charities after hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition calling for the products to be exempted from tax altogether. The government said the latest Â£12m of funding announced in March benefitted 70 UK charities. However, MPs and campaign groups criticised the Â£250,000 grant awarded to anti-abortion group Life - one of the largest amounts from the government fund. Life said the money supported a project for homeless pregnant women in London. An HMT spokesperson said: ""We strongly support cutting VAT to zero on tampons and that's why the Finance Act 2016 included legislation to make this happen - however we cannot do this under current EU law. ""In the meantime, we're awarding Â£15m a year to women's charities - equivalent to the amount of VAT raised from the sale of women's sanitary products"".

"Teigan Scott is moving up to secondary A remote Orkney island primary school is to lose its only pupil, raising fears about its long-term future. North Ronaldsay Primary School's single classroom will be kept on standby from August as Teigan Scott, 12, moves to secondary in Kirkwall. Orkney's most northerly island only has a population of about 50 people. Orkney Islands Council said the school would be brought back into use if more families with young children moved to the island. The building is also used by community groups. Island residents have blamed poor transport links for the lack of young families. Teigan told the BBC she was looking forward to moving on to secondary but worried for the future of her former school. ""I am excited to go up to the bigger school,"" she said. ""But I have a tiny little drop of sadness because the school will be closing and the island might fall apart."" North Ronaldsay is Orkney's most northerly island Councillor Kevin Woodbridge said the population on North Ronaldsay had halved since he arrived in 1977. He said: ""It's very sad but it demonstrates the decline on the island that has led to this. ""When I came here there were 17 people at the school and 127 on the island, now we have 50 to 60 people. ""The quality of life on the island can be improved considerably."" The number of people living on North Ronaldsay has been declining Billy Muir, chairman of the community council, said the loss of the school's only pupil was ""a very serious blow for the community and no doubt will have a knock-on effect"". He said: ""We need new housing to be built and to get new families in. You want a number of kids in the school, not just one. ""Higher speed broadband is needed too. ""There's no point painting a good picture, we have to be realistic. Hopefully this highlights our problem."" A spokesman for the local authority said: ""North Ronaldsay Primary School's single classroom is part of a building housing a range of community facilities. ""The classroom will be kept on standby from August onwards and would be used as a school room again if a family or families with primary-age children move to the island. ""In the meantime, it will remain open for people of all ages in North Ronaldsay to use for a range of learning activities, managed by the local community association. ""This approach to keeping the room actively in use has been developed in discussion between Orkney Islands Council and a number of community groups in North Ronaldsay.""

"North Korea said it conducted its first ICBM test in early July - the latest took place late at night North Korea has conducted a new intercontinental ballistic missile test, South Korea and the Pentagon say. The missile reached an altitude of about 3,000km (1,865 miles) and landed in the sea off Japan, the Japanese national broadcaster NHK said. It comes three weeks after North Korea's first ICBM test. In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said. The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said. The latest North Korean missile flew higher, further and for longer than the one in early July. Its launch has been condemned by a number of countries. The test - the 14th carried out by North Korea in 2017 - is the latest to be conducted in defiance of a UN ban. US President Donald Trump called it ""only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime"". Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said that initial indications showed the latest missilehad a range of about 10,000km,external- far enough to strike the west coast of the United States and beyond. The Washington Postreported,externalthat Denver and possibly Chicago could now be in North Korea's range. How the US might defend itself Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un? The latest missile was launched at 23:41 (15:41 GMT) from an arms plant in Jagang province in the north of the country, the Pentagon said. It is unusual for North Korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear. No missileshad been fired from Jagang province before,external, indicating a previously-unknown launch site is operational. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew for about 45 minutes - some six minutes longer than the ICBM tested in early July. Is ICBM test a game-changer? What the outside world can do NHK said it reached an altitude of about 3,000km - about 200km higher than the previous ICBM. It landed about 1,000km from the launch site, the Pentagon said. ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries. In the latest reaction: South Korea's President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency security meeting for the middle of the night Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did the same, saying: ""The threat to Japan's security has become grave and real"" Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said: ""We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation"" Despite ongoing tests, experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Does N Korea have the bomb? Others, however,believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US. This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? The US has installed a missile defence system in South Korea to combat the threat from the North, but the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) has angered many in the region, especially China. South Korea's president said he wanted to hold talks with the US on deploying more of the Thaad units in the wake of the latest tests, Yonhap reported. What can the outside world do about N Korea?

"Campaigners say that, in many cases in India, abusers are known to the children India's Supreme Court has refused to allow an abortion for a 10-year-old girl, allegedly raped by her uncle, on the grounds that she is too far into her pregnancy. A doctors' panel told the court that, at 32 weeks, termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Her pregnancy was discovered two weeks ago when she complained of stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. A lower court had earlier turned down her plea on similar grounds. Without disclosing the details of the medical report, the judges on Friday ruled that termination was ""not good for the girl"". They have asked the government-run Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research hospital in the northern city of Chandigarh to ensure that proper medical care is provided to her. The top court has also suggested that the Indian government set up a permanent medical board in each state to take prompt decisions in such cases. India child rape victim in abortion plea Why an MP wants India to talk about child sex abuse The Indian girls who survived being raped On Monday, the Supreme Court had ordered doctors to evaluate whether the girl could undergo abortion safely. The court order came after lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava filed a public interest petition saying doctors who had already examined the girl found her pelvic bones had not fully developed because of her age and the life of both mother and baby were at ""very serious risk"". ""Medical experts have categorically opined that if the 10-year-old is forced to give birth, either through normal delivery or even through caesarean-section, it may be fatal to the life of the rape survivor as well as to her child,"" the petition said. The girl belongs to an extremely poor family, her father is a government employee and mother works as a domestic helper. The girl alleges she was raped several times in the past seven months by her uncle, who has been arrested. Her pregnancy was only recently discovered because she herself was unaware of her condition. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors confirm the mother's life is in danger. A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015 240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18 53.22% of children who participatedin a government study,externalreported some form of sexual abuse 50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers"" Sources: Indian government, Unicef The tough law against abortion was introduced in 1971 to prevent illegal and unsafe abortions and curb maternal mortality. The restrictions remain an important weapon in India's fight against a skewed gender ratio which has resulted from a deep-seated cultural preference for sons. Millions of female foetuses have been aborted over the years by pregnant women after undergoing foetal gender testing. In recent years, Indian courts have received several petitions, many from child rape survivors, seeking to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says. In most such cases, the pregnancy is not even discovered until after the 20-week period is over because the children are themselves unaware of their condition, our correspondent adds. In May, a court in Haryana state asked medical experts to comment ona similar pleaand a panel of doctors decided to carry out a termination. Medical experts say girls can start menstruating and ovulating at nine, but their bodies are not mature enough for pregnancy at that age. India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children globally, with some campaigners saying it has reached epidemic proportions. But there is a general reluctance to talk about the problem and it is rarely discussed in public. Studies have shown that in large numbers of cases the abusers are known to the children and include care-givers like parents, relatives and teachers.

"Many question why Charlie's parents were not allowed to explore every option The protracted and bitter dispute over Charlie Gard began with the breakdown in the relationship of trust between doctors and parents. When his medical team, with second opinions from several leading centres, decided that his brain damage was irreversible, they believed there was nothing that could help him. That was six months ago, but they had no power to end Charlie's life support without the backing of his parents. That meant Great Ormond Street Hospital had to apply to the courts. A succession of judges ruled it was in Charlie's best interests to die, because he may be suffering and the proposed experimental treatment in the United States was ""futile"". Some commentators in the United States said Charlie's plight was the result of the UK having a state-run national health service. Mr Justice Francis said that was ""nonsensical"". Many will still question why Charlie's parents were not granted their wish to explore every option, even if the chances of improvement were slim. Connie Yates and Chris Gard were buoyed by support from an American neurologist, Prof Michio Hirano, who has pioneered an experimental treatment, a powder called nucleoside therapy. But he gave his support without having requested Charlie's full medical records. Dr Hirano was invited to examine Charlie in January and eventually did so in July. Charlie's parents raised Â£1.3m for their son's treatment through donations The guardian appointed to represent Charlie in court said if novel therapies were to be offered it was ""imperative that those offering to provide them are fully aware of the clinical condition"" so that ""offers are made on an informed basis and without setting up false hopes and expectations"". In court, there was discussion of the differing ethical approaches to experimental treatment between the UK and the USA. In the United States, it may be considered appropriate to give a patient a drug even though it cannot help them, on the grounds that it helps others in the future. In the UK, patients cannot receive drugs that doctors know will not help them personally. As well as the legal dispute, there was a second battle fought very effectively online by Charlie's parents. They crowd-funded Â£1.3m, with more than 80,000 donations, and there were petitions and a Facebook site called Charlie's Army. The Pope and Donald Trump were among those who tweeted their support - Charlie's fate became an international issue with pro-life groups attaching themselves to the campaign. The judge said it was one of the pitfalls of social media that the watching world felt it right to have opinions without knowing the facts of the case. Doctors and nurses at Great Ormond Street, one of the world's most renowned children's hospitals, were subject to abuse and even death threats - which Charlie's parents condemned. In such cases, medical staff always remain anonymous, but this made it hard to counter the repeated anguished public appeals by Charlie's parents, and the moving images of their son. Great Ormond Street Hospital said Charlie's parents had tirelessly advocated for what they sincerely believed was right for their son and nobody could fault them for doing so. The hospital said it would be giving careful thought to what it could learn from the ""bruising"" court case - and it added that everyone wished there could have been a less tragic outcome.

"Two people wanted for interview regarding a collision with a pedestrian in Islington, north London Offences involving scooters and mopeds have rocketed in London, but the epidemic is yet to spread to the rest of the UK. In one incident on a Friday night, earlier this month, a heavily pregnant woman became a victim of moped criminals. In a terrifying attack that took only a few seconds, the 31-year-old mother-to-be was knocked to the ground after thieves mounted the pavement from behind her to snatch a mobile phone out of her hand. I witnessed the aftermath of the attack in north London from an open window of a restaurant a few yards away. I heard the woman's scream and saw her on the floor, but by the time I'd dialled 999 the two robbers had sped off. The incident, in East Finchley, a relatively low-crime area towards the southern end of the London borough of Barnet, provided further evidence of the spread of the ""moped"" crime wave. Pursuit rules 'create moped highwaymen' (The Metropolitan Police refer to the ""step-through-frame"" motorcycles commonly used as scooters - mopeds are strictly speaking a subset of scooters, with an engine capacity of less than 50cc). CCTV footage of a moped-enabled robbery in east London, 2016 There are two parts to the crime wave - the theft of the scooters themselves and the offences for which they are used. The Met says that between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 14,943 thefts of ""powered two-wheel vehicles"", the vast majority of which were scooters. The total represents more than 50% of all vehicles stolen in London and is up almost 30% on the previous year. The calendar year figures show the number of thefts has almost doubled since 2013, though the proportion recovered has increased as well. It also appears to be a problem largely confined to the capital. Police in Merseyside and Greater Manchester have set up special teams to combat the illegal use of off-road, or scrambler, bikes, particularly in relation to anti-social behaviour, but none of the  major forces we spoke to across Britain flagged scooter theft as a concern on the scale seen in London. According to the Motorcycle Industry Association, about 60% of all recorded bike thefts in the UK were in London last year, yet just under 10% of all motorcycles and mopeds licensed in the UK were registered to those living in the city. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick (right) meets scooter, motorcycle and moped riders to discuss thefts The rise in thefts has been sparked in part by an upsurge in the stock of scooters available to be stolen.  As the capital becomes more congested and car insurance more costly, scooters have grown in popularity, and as people order more items online, there are more delivery drivers and couriers using them too. Unlike cars, which have immobilisers, alarms and sophisticated key devices fitted as standard, the main line of defence for a scooter is usually the steering lock, which can be disabled fairly easily. Police recommend other security measures including trackers, marking devices, covers and chain locks - but thieves have been known to cut through those using angle grinders. Discussions with the motorcycle industry about more effective security are continuing but it's likely to be two or three years before anti-theft systems are embedded into the design of all scooters. Security for mopeds remains basic for the most part ""Industry can provide the means to secure bikes, but it can't fix the problems that lead to lawlessness,"" says Steve Kenward, chief executive of the Motorcycle Industry Association. ""That is a matter for police, law-makers and the services which tackle disaffection,"" he adds. You might also like: Calling your husband by name for the first time Man poisoned after eating cherry seeds Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? Simon Harding, senior lecturer in criminology at Middlesex University, says the other ""modus operandi"" for thieves is ""use of force"" - getting riders off their scooters by threatening them.  No anti-theft device can prevent that. Dr Harding says although some stolen scooters are stripped for parts or shipped abroad (the average value of each machine stolen is estimated to be Â£3,000) the main attraction for the gangs is the ability to use them to carry out drug deals and commit other crimes - sometimes as many as 10 in the space of an hour. The number of such offences recorded by police in London has more than trebled in a year. In the 12 months to the end of June, the Metropolitan Police logged 16,158 crimes involving powered-two-wheel vehicles compared with 5,145 the year before. Most of the offences were robbery and theft, with mobile phones making up 90% of items stolen. Phones can be reset within minutes and sold on, or used by gang members who like to have a handful of devices each. ""It's almost the perfect crime because they're committing it with gloves, helmets and visors,"" says Harding. ""It's very difficult to see them, it's all over in seconds...and they're keenly aware that police may not chase them."" Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty, vehicle crime lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, denies that it is the ""perfect crime"", pointing out that it is conducted in public, which means there are often witnesses. But he acknowledges that officers will end a pursuit if it gets ""too dangerous"". ""We do a lot of risk assessment about whether to pursue someone,"" says Mr McNulty. ""Driving in London at speed, with lots of pedestrians, in built-up areas is a high-risk strategy."" An officer embarking on a car chase with criminals on a scooter has to seek authorisation from their control room. A tactical adviser will be on hand and the operation will be overseen by a chief inspector.  They will weigh up the risks of the pursuit against the seriousness of the offence of which the rider is suspected. Police will consider if the suspect might be a danger to the public and if they are on their way to carry out more crimes, as well as conditions on the road - the weather, the time of day and whether there is a lot of other traffic. The risks were brought home last year during the inquest into the death of 18-year-old Henry Hicks, who lost control of his moped and crashed after being pursued by two unmarked police cars in north London in December 2014. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which investigated the case, said police had ""conducted a pursuit without authorisation from a senior officer in the control room"" and had failed to ""consider the risks to Henry of the pursuit or make any consideration as to whether he may have been a juvenile"".  Four officers are to face gross misconduct proceedings. After the case, Scotland Yard issued a reminder to officers about the potential hazards of such pursuits and said it had developed new tactics - including the use of tyre-deflation devices.  But there's believed to be a sense among scooter thieves that police have become more cautious about following them at speed. ""People are very well aware of the police tactics, therefore they're picking out vehicles... on the assumption that they're unlikely to be caught,"" says Daniel Silverstone, director of the Liverpool Centre for Advanced Policing Studies, who's carrying out research on scooter criminals. ""They're deliberately taking their helmets off, so they can't be pursued,"" he says, claiming police will call off a chase if they know a suspect is more at risk of a head injury. CCTV footage released by police of moped rider suspected of a robbery in Croydon, south London Mr McNulty says although suspects removing their helmets is one of the ""elements"" they have to think about during a pursuit, he says it also gives police a ""real advantage"" because their face can be seen by victims, bystanders and on CCTV. Indeed, much of the detective work involves identifying criminals in the hours and days after a pursuit by scouring phone and video footage, tracing the routes they take and looking for fingerprints and DNA evidence. This week,two men were jailed for robbery,externalafter the owner of a Vespa was stabbed with a kitchen knife - John Tusting received a 10-year sentence and Lucian Riviere was jailed for eight years. And last October, a thief who snatched 21 phones in an hour as he drove through five London boroughswas given a three-year sentence. But in spite of the successes of the Met's anti-scooter crime campaign, Operation Venice, it appears to be an increasingly fashionable way for young criminals in particular to boost their street cred. They post online images of themselves on stolen bikes and circulate stories about what they have done. ""A great deal of it is about how young people are trying to rise above the pack,"" says Dr Harding. ""It's being used to build up street capital, to build up their reputation."" Dr Harding says it is a crime that ""suits the moment"", with so many potential victims walking around with expensive phones, tablets and headphones, and it offers excitement - from the first stage, stealing the scooter, to the last, escaping from police. ""There is an absolute thrill factor - young people love the theft, the chase, the crime, the buzz - with the chase from police at the end,"" he says. The two thieves who stole the pregnant woman's phone in East Finchley were chased by a man on a motorbike who happened to be in the area - but he lost sight of them. Thankfully, the victim's baby was unharmed, although she was left bruised and severely shaken. There is a fear, however, that the violence is escalating, with a spate of scooter attacks involving corrosive substances in the past few weeks. There is also concern that it could spread beyond London, which for reasons that are not entirely clear, has so far borne the brunt of this spate of attacks. For the moment, there is no end in sight to this most mobile of crimes. Pursuit rules 'create moped highwaymen' Man killed in moped stabbing named Woman dragged by moped bag thieves.

"Like the thin twig of peace, the Brexit metaphor has been stretched to melting point. It should be taken round the back of the paragraph and quietly put out of its misery. Since Britain voted to leave the European Union, politicians and commentators have deployed everything from cakes, cherries, cats, even golf clubs to try to explain what it might all mean. Yet, in recent weeks, it has become clear that many of these analogies have become absurd and redundant. The head of the UK's public spending watchdog, Sir Amyas Morse, compares Brexit to ""a chocolate orange"" that might fall apart at the first tap. The Tory MP Charlie Elphicke fears a ""Hotel California"" Brexit where ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"". The businessman Lord Wolfson likens Brexit to a frantic bus journey where the passengers are fighting over its speed and direction. And Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, the international lawyer and wife of the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, compares Brexit on her food blog to a strawberry pudding: ""The crumble, just like Brexit, seems fine on the outside, though if you look attentively you can see that there is a mess bubbling up inside. And it will definitely fall apart when you serve it, no matter how hard you try."" Enough, please. Enough. In the beginning, there was some sense in using metaphor to explain a complex issue. Brexit was ""soft"" if it involved continued membership of the single market or customs union, ""hard"" if it meant the opposite. Theresa May then muddied the waters by uttering these words: ""I'm interested in all these terms that have been identified - hard Brexit, soft Brexit, black Brexit, white Brexit, grey Brexit - and actually what we should be looking for is a red, white and blue Brexit."" Brexit was compared to marital separation because it allowed people to distinguish between Britain's immediate exit from the EU - the ""divorce"" - and its longer-term trading relations. But the comparison was stretched to unsustainable lengths, with discussion about who gets to divide the music collection and keep the children and so on. To Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, Brexit resembles a fruit crumble There was also the small problem that in this divorce one side was made up of 27 different nations. Is ""Mutti"" Merkel the mother in this metaphor and the other 26 countries her children? Up to a point, Dr Freud. The prime minister told MPs in March she did not like the ""divorce"" metaphor. ""I prefer not to use that term with regard to the European Union because often, when people get divorced, they do not have a good relationship afterwards."" So her dutiful Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, steered away from marital matters and chose a metaphor closer to his stomach than his heart. He declared that when it came to Brexit, he wanted Britain to ""have its cake and eat it"". The EU countered with its own gastronomic analogy, saying that ""cherry picking"" the best bits of the EU would not be tolerated. Brexit risks being 'chocolate orange' May: Dinner row claim is Brussels gossip Again these clichÃ©s made some sort of sense at first but later became rather silly. I went to a seminar recently where someone declared - without irony - that Britain did not want to have its cake and eat it, it just did not agree with the EU what the recipe for the cake should be. The debate about how much money the UK should pay when it exits the EU has prompted many figurative contortions. Some in Britain argued that when one leaves a golf club, one should stop paying the direct debit and certainly not fork out for another round of green fees. But the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, insisted over dinner with Theresa May in April that the EU was ""not a golf club that could be easily joined or left""; it was a family, and Brexit should be treated as divorce. The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, was more prosaic, comparing Britain's outstanding payments to a round of drinks, telling the Financial Times that ""it would be wrong for EU taxpayers to be asked to pay Britain's bar bill"". Is Brexit a full-blown divorce or a mere settling of domestic accounts? On the other side of Brussels, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, disagreed, declaring: ""There is no Brexit bill. The financial settlement is only about settling the accounts."" The problem is that this only adds to the confusion. To a French speaker, ""settling the accounts"" means no more than Britain paying its debts. To an English speaker, it can just as easily mean the EU seeking its revenge. Take the Daily Telegraph's Allister Heath, for example, who wrote that by demanding billions of euros from the UK, the EU was trying to impose war reparations. ""The last time this sort of idiocy was attempted was in 1919, at the Treaty of Versailles, when a defeated Germany was ordered to accept full responsibility for the war and to pay vast reparations to the allied powers."" This video can not be played May: Iâm ambitious for what we can achieve The problem with these metaphors is that they confuse the point of the financial dispute, namely how much Britain should pay for EU spending in the future, and not just for its current and past obligations. Unless, of course, confusion is the point, a little creative ambiguity to nudge the negotiations along. And still the metaphor-fest has rolled on. Mr Verhofstadt - him again - has described Brexit as a ""catfight in the Conservative Party that got out of hand"". Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected French president, has said the UK is finding out that Brexit was ""no walk in the park"". The respected commentator, Philip Collins, wrote recently in The Times, that ""leaving the European Union is a SchrÃ¶dinger's cat kind of problem"". Such is his confidence in the intelligence and knowledge of Times' readers that Mr Collins chose not to offer a word of explanation. Those of us unfamiliar with this particular feline had to reach for Google to discover it refers to a thought problem asking if it is possible to hold two contradictory truths at the same time. The EU chief negotiator's reference to hilly climbs strike may have struck a chord with the prime minister At a recent news conference, Michel Barnier went on a flight of metaphorical Brexit fancy when he revealed that he, like Theresa May, also enjoyed hill walking. ""If you like walking in the mountains you have to learn a number of rules. You have to learn to put one foot in front of the other because sometimes you are on a steep and rocky path. You also have to look [at] what accidents might befall you - falling rocks."" He added: ""You have to be very careful to keep your breath. You have to have stamina because it could be a lengthy path and you have to keep looking at the summit."" This is very practical or very deep. Either way, it is very French. And it is certainly too much. Can we just agree that Brexit means Brexit and leave it at that?

"The recently released Echo Show is the range's first to include a screen Amazon's range of smart speakers and their artificial intelligence assistant Alexa have proved to be a huge sales hit. But the product is still a shadow of what the man in charge - Dave Limp - and indeed their owners, hope it will become. ""We have thousands of engineers inside Amazon adding to [its] capability every day and then another tens of thousands of developers adding to the skills,"" he tells the BBC. ""The thing I am sure of is that this time next year she will be significantly more intelligent than she is now, and that sometime in the future we will hit our goal of reinventing the Star Trek computer."" It's a lofty goal, especially since any attempt to go beyond commanding a weather update or asking for the lights to be switched on is currently asking for trouble. Try to have anything close to a normal conversation with Alexa and it tells you it doesn't understand or cannot help. But though it may not always be obvious, the firm says rapid progress is being made. The original Amazon Echo speaker first went on limited release in November 2014 ""One [feature] that we've rolled out relatively recently here in the UK is she can start answering follow-up questions,"" Mr Limp gives as an example of behind-the-scenes work being done. ""So, she understands some simple kind of pronouns. ""You could ask, 'What's the weather here in London?' and then do a follow-up question, 'What's the population there?' ""And she'll know the context was London."" Jeff Bezos: the $89bn man Smart tech helps catch home intruders Amazon's profits fall sharply Can Amazon's assistant stay on top? He also draws attention to the fact that Alexa recently crossed the 15,000 ""skills"" threshold - its name for voice-controlled apps. That figure sounds all the more impressive when you consider its nearest rival, Google Home, has fewer than 400. One consultancy calculated that Amazon's skill count is currentlygrowing at 37 times the rate,externalof the search giant's. But the question is how many of the programs are truly useful. For all the promise of compelling new ways to control home appliances or on-demand news updates from major media brands, there seem to be a mountain of apps dedicated to delivering ""fun facts"", gags, wacky noises and a vast range of ambient sounds. Amazon has many more third-party apps than its rivals Or as one study suggested earlier this year, a whopping 97% ofvoice skills are left unused after just one week,externalof being installed. ""I guess I would not agree with the thesis that some of the skills are not sticky - many of them are,"" says Mr Limp when challenged about quality. ""You never know which one of those Cat Facts is going to turn into the next big thing. There are many examples of that out there. ""We want to build tools in such a way that the individual hobbyist can build something but also the most professional enterprise developer can build something as well and everything in between. ""Consumers will choose the ones they find most useful and the cream will rise the top. But I would tell you, there is a lot of cream now."" Arguably, what fuelled the creation of quality apps for smartphones was allowing their developers to sell them and build in ads. Mr Limp worked at Apple and Palm before joining Amazon to run its devices division Without that, it's hard to see how the mobile versions of Minecraft or Facebook would have prospered. But for now, at least, Amazon does not allow either opportunity. ""There are already people who are monetising in some ways,"" Mr Limp points out. ""Some of the smart home applications have subscription services. Spotify [has] a premium tier. ""But with any new medium, and you mentioned smartphones, in the early days there was also no clear way to monetise - but eventually you find a path. ""What I'm not sure is will it be the same as what we've seen on other platforms."" Amazon may currently dominate the smart speaker market but it's getting more crowded. Alternatives powered by Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana go on sale later this year. In China, there's already a plethora of such devices, with Alibaba and Xiaomi the latest to unveil models. And if news reports are to be believed,Samsung,externalandFacebook,externalcould be next in line. Amazon faces smart speaker competition from Google, Microsoft, Apple and Xiaomi among others Many market watchers agree, however, that Amazon has one advantage over much of the competition: its online store. The firm currently sells Echo devices for roughly what it costs to produce them, and its ultimate goal is for owners to use them to buy more stuff. ""The early response is that customers certainly resonate with the ability to reorder things,"" Mr Limp says when asked whether customers are proving willing. ""Generally if you have ordered one type of paper towels, you tend to continue with those kinds of paper towels. Other manufacturers are also building Alexa into their products, including a fridge made by LG ""So, reusables and consumables are things that are showing sort of early promise. ""But again it's just beginning, and as we like to say at Amazon, we're kind of at day one and we have a lot to learn."" The company recently expanded the Echo family with two new models, one with a built-in screen, the other - still in test phase - designed to make recommendations about what you should wear based on owners modelling two outfits in front of its cameras. ""The ability to have a machine-learning algorithm distinguish through Style Check which outfit is better to wear at that particular moment, is just mind-boggling,"" Mr Limp suggests. ""It's informed by human beings but the algorithms are coming along quite nicely - I'm very optimistic that this is a problem that can be completely solved by machine learning."" A number of customers have been chosen to test the Echo Look's fashion-picking abilities For now, it's fair to say that many owners still get most use out of their Echos by using them to play music. Amazon already supports some third-party streaming services in addition to its own, but not the market's second most popular, Apple Music. So, if Apple knocked on the door, would Amazon allow it in? ""It would be something we would consider,"" Mr Limp says. ""Obviously it would come down to what it meant on behalf of customers, but certainly we would look at it.""

"The Killers (L-R): Ronnie Vannucci, Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer It's 9am on 11 February, 1990. Mike Tyson enters the ring at the Tokyo Dome as the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world. His opponent, Buster Douglas, is a textbook underdog. Most bookmakers refused to take bets for the fight. The Mirage Casino in Las Vegas was one of the few that did - and they made Tyson the 42-1 favourite. But then, in the 10th round, Tyson wastaken down,externalby a furious four-punch volley - right, left, right, left. He was left scrabbling around on the floor, badly disorientated and searching for his gum shield, as referee Octavio Meyran counted him out. Back in Tyson's home town of Las Vegas, an eight-year-old Brandon Flowers watched the fight in disbelief. Tyson's knock-out has gone down as one of the biggest defeats in sporting history ""Mike Tyson was perfect to me,"" he tells the BBC. ""He created such excitement around the world - but he lived in Las Vegas, and he got my dad excited, he got my uncles excited, so that made me want to be excited about it. ""My friend Edwin Speight, his dad worked for the mayor in Henderson - so he got the fight at his house on pay-per-view. I remember it was 50 bucks. ""We went to his house to watch it - he lived across the street - and I can still see his living room and feel his Kush carpet. It was kind of dusky and twilight. ""Then Tyson got knocked out [and] my whole view on the world changed. ""It wasn't supposed to happen."" Twenty-seven years later, Flowers is the front-man in one of the world's biggest rock bands, The Killers. But that 1990 night is indelibly imprinted on his mind. ""This vision reoccurs,"" he says. ""I see it a lot and I don't know why. So I started to explore it with a song."" That song, an open-road anthem called Tyson vs Douglas, will appear on The Killers' fifth album later this September. ""When I saw him go down, it felt like somebody lied,"" sings Flowers in the chorus. ""I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears."" But in the third verse, the focus shifts to Flowers in the present day, ""looking out the window"" at ""my boy and his mother"". ""I have a son now who is the same age I was when [the Tyson fight] happened,"" he explains. ""And to him and his two little brothers, I am as perfect as Mike Tyson - and I don't want to go down."" Back in 1990, Tyson put his failure down to a lack of preparation. ""I was out of shape, more or less,"" he said after the fight. ""I didn't consider Buster Douglas much of a challenge. I didn't even bother watching any of his fights on video. I had easily beaten everybody who had knocked him out."" Flowers is determined not to make that mistake. Relaunching The Killers after a five-year break, he's lean, fit and match-ready. He's even written a song about it - a strutting slice of glam-rock calledThe Man,external. The singer gets to dress up in his Las Vegas finest in the video for The Man ""I got gas in the tank / I got money in the bank,""he preens.""I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man."" Flowers says the lyrics are about ""re-inhabiting my 21-year-old self"" - a much more confrontational character, prone to Liam Gallagher-style belligerence. ""Emo, pop-punk, whatever you want to call it, is dangerous,"" he said of the artists coming up at the same time as The Killers in the early 2000s. ""There's a creature inside me that wants to beat all those bands to death."" ""It was a naÃ¯ve, bold place I was coming from,"" he says today. ""I hadn't faced rejection or any real trials in my life at that point, and so I had a different outlook on life. I just went at the world chest-first."" These days, the band isn't so cocksure. When they played asecret set at Glastonburylast month, they weren't sure anyone would turn up. ""You never know what other band is nipping at your heels, or whether people still care about you,"" says drummer Ronnie Vannucci. ""Our version of time is different than the fans' version of time. We're working on stuff, but everyone else's lives are still going on. ""So Glastonbury was such a great feeling. We didn't expect it to be so good."" Despite their hiatus, the band have never been far from the public's consciousness in the UK. Their debut single, Mr Brightside, wasstreamed 26 million times last year- meaning that, 13 years after release, it features in the UK Top 100 almost every week. That's pretty good going for a song that only managed four weeks in the chart when it first came out. ""We get little glimpses of stuff like that and it's just incredible,"" says Flowers. ""As fans, we know what that feels like. ""Whether it's Enjoy the Silence from Depeche Mode or Where The Streets Have No Name from U2 - those songs belong to everyone. ""To be a part of it, on the other side of it, it's nothing that we can really explain. But it's really cool."" Still, the phenomenal success of Mr Brightside, and the band's debut album Hot Fuss, are big things to live up to. They admit they felt that pressure as they reconvened to make their fifth album. ""One of the nagging things that I was carrying with me was asking myself, 'Where do the Killers fit in? And what do they have to contribute?'"" says Flowers. Bassist Mark Stoermer played with the band at Glastonbury but no longer regularly tours The creative process began in October 2015, with producers like Steve Lillywhite (U2) and Ryan Tedder (Adele) on board. But a whole year passed with no results. ""It was a struggle at times, for sure,"" acknowledges Flowers. ""More so than other albums, and I can't really say that I know why."" Then Bono suggested the band call in Garret ""Jacknife"" Lee, who'd been working on U2's Songs of Experience album, and suddenly things turned a corner. ""We tried lots of different avenues but, once we got in the room with Jacknife, it became apparent that maybe we'd gone a little bit too far out into the atmosphere,"" says Flowers. The album's labour pains are charted in the closing track called, with a heavy dose of self-doubt, Have All The Songs Been Written? ""It's daunting sometimes because there's been so much good stuff before now,"" says the singer, ""So that was definitely a question I was asking myself."" Luckily, he's found a good answer - with The Killers' most vital album since Sam's Town in 2006. ""We impose pressure on ourselves,"" say the band of living up to their former glories The title track, Wonderful Wonderful, is built around a wonderfully menacing bassline with Flowers in full ranting preacher mode, while Rut is his most vulnerable ballad to date. Best of the bunch, though, is Run For Cover - a tightly-strung indie anthem about a senator who's cheated on his wife. As the guitar ratchets up, the politician holds a press conference and shouts ""Fake news!"" before the song gives way to a classic Killers chorus. So don't expect the band to go the way of Mike Tyson just yet - and Flowers' reputation with his children will remain intact, even if they're not that bothered about his day job. ""When we played Hyde Park, it was the first Killers gig any of my kids had seen because it's usually bedtime when we go on,"" he recently told BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley. ""But even then, Gunnar, my middle boy, was asleep by the end."" Wonderful Wonderful will be released  on 22 September.

"As Aphra watched her son Allan graduate from Cambridge University last month, she thought back to the moment he was born. ""I'm so sorry your baby is blind,"" a neighbour in Baghdad had said. Aphra became the talk of the town because of the taboo associated with her son's condition. It wasIraqin 1995 - Saddam Hussein was president, the Gulf War had ended only three years earlier and citizens were suffering under sanctions placed on the country. As a blind child, Allan Hennessy's prospects were poor. Political unrest in Baghdad, Iraq in 1992 Today, walking around his college in Cambridge, Allan is confident and articulate: ""I have so many accents now,"" he says. ""If someone from Iraq calls, I answer in Arabic, 'As-salaam-alaikum'. ""At Cambridge I have a posh, round-vowelled voice. ""Then I speak to a mate from the estate - 'Oh my days, all right bruv?' This video can not be played Allan Hennessy was born totally blind in Iraq after the Gulf War. He is only 22 but already Allan has smashed barriers that many will not face in a lifetime. So how did a baby born blind in a war-torn country become a top student at a world-leading university? In Iraq, Allan's family were middle class - his grandfather was a sheikh and they lived a comfortable, even luxurious life. But Iraqi hospitals could not offer Allan hope of sight. ""My dad tried to get me treatment but there weren't enough eye specialists - they thought I would always be blind."" But when Allan was six months old, an opportunity came and Allan's father seized it. ""My dad sold up to pay for the treatment - his car, belongings, some of his land. We left Iraq with very little."" An eye operation in London restored partial sight in one of Allan's eyes The opportunity was an operation in London which restored partial sight in Allan's left eye. ""My mum remembers the first time I looked at her - the first time we made eye contact. She burst into tears. ""Since then I've just been rocking on with the little sight I have,"" he explains. Allan with his family Allan's mother and his siblings also sought political asylum in London, but life as immigrants was challenging. ""They enjoyed their life in Iraq, but when circumstances changed, they were forced to become refugees. ""They did not speak English, and we lived on London council estates - they had a real culture shock."" Allan and his siblings meeting Father Christmas ""Jihadi John""- who joined so-calledIslamic Statein Syria and appeared in videos showing beheadings of prisoners - grew up on the same estate. Although Allan is visibly uncomfortable at any mention of the militant, the link highlights the difference between his childhood and many of his peers at Cambridge. ""When people at university ask me about my life, they think 'he's had a really difficult life'. ""But the reason I'm able to get on with it is because I look back at my family in Iraq and I think I'm very privileged."" Allan is not the type of person to do what he is told. ""I've lived my life thinking I'm not partially-sighted. ""I loved riding my bike and climbing scaffolding, even though I wasn't really meant to. ""When we went to the fairground, I always wanted to drive the bumper cars."" Like many children, Allan was no angel at school. ""I was in the lowest set for everything and I would bunk off school. I threw eggs at buses, stuff that teenagers do,"" he says. But eventually Allan realised he could do better: ""After GCSEs I got a new energy and I realised the kids in the top sets weren't any smarter than me."" In 2012 he applied to study law at Cambridge University. ""Everyone and everything was so white - I felt visibly different,"" he says, recalling his first impressions. He became one of only seven people with impaired sightaccepted,externalthat year and the first person in his family to attend university. ""All my life I've been told I cannot, must not, should not and would not. The disabled stereotype is subdued, helpless - and the biggest struggle for me is to overcome that stigma. ""When you leave your lane, you are treated with negativity and scorn. You receive a lot of hatred for what you do, but all you're doing is what 'normal' people are doing,"" he says. Allan spent three years at Fitzwilliam College and says it has been transformative. ""I met the most amazing people from all over the world. But there was also a lot of negativity directed at me. ""When you're an overweight, brown, blind guy climbing the greasy pole, everyone can see and they judge you - even though they are doing it too."" What would his life be like if he had stayed in Iraq? ""I wouldn't have a Cambridge law degree - I wouldn't even be sighted. ""My family there have faced terrible, traumatic events, including capture by so-called Islamic State. ""Perhaps I wouldn't be alive."" Allan with his mum at graduation After graduating this summer, Allan is taking up a prestigious scholarship at law school. ""If you've got a first-class law degree from Cambridge University, that should set you up for life,"" he says. ""But when you're a blind, Muslim immigrant living in Britain today, there is so much more I have to do. The journey has only just begun.""

"John Terry and family were away skiing when the break-in happened Burglars who raided the Surrey mansion of former England captain John Terry and took designer goods worth more than Â£400,000 have been jailed. Terry's home was targeted after he posted pictures from the French Alps and told 3.4 million Instagram followers he was having ""a great few days away skiing with the family"". At Kingston Crown Court four men admitted conspiracy to commit burglary. A fifth man admitted handling stolen goods. Judge Susan Tapping said the burglary at the Oxshott mansion was part of a ""carefully planned"" series of seven raids in which goods worth Â£600,000 were stolen from luxury homes in Surrey and Sussex. At Terry's home, the burglars took designer handbags worth Â£126,000, including items by Chanel, Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and jewellery worth more than Â£220,000. They also took rare signed Harry Potter first edition books valued at Â£18,000. The judge said the house was ""deliberately targeted"" in February and the master bedroom suite ransacked. ""It might have been a mistake to post a family photograph on social media to show that he was away on holiday,"" she said. She said the gang were ""experienced, if not professional burglars"" and were not content with their first haul. They returned with an unidentified man, who was not in court, and an angle grinder, ""determined to get in the safe"" - but the noise woke the housekeeper and triggered an alarm. After the hearing, Det Con Phil Carter said the gang had targeted high-value homes, some with the occupants present which was likely to have been ""very upsetting"". He said the loss to victims was ""substantial"". The gang received the following jail sentences: Darren Eastaugh, 30, of Bedfont, London: seven years, three months; Joshua Sumer, 27, of Havant, Hampshire: eight years; Roy Head, 28, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey: seven years, four months; Oliver Hart, 25, also of Walton-on-Thames: five years, four months; Kye Hardy-King, 25, of Hounslow, London, who admitted handling stolen goods: 12-month sentence suspended for a year, two-month curfew and rehabilitation.

"North Korea said it conducted its first ICBM test in early July - the latest took place late at night North Korea has conducted a new intercontinental ballistic missile test, South Korea and the Pentagon say. The missile reached an altitude of about 3,000km (1,865 miles) and landed in the sea off Japan, the Japanese national broadcaster NHK said. It comes three weeks after North Korea's first ICBM test. In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said. The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said. The latest North Korean missile flew higher, further and for longer than the one in early July. Its launch has been condemned by a number of countries. The test - the 14th carried out by North Korea in 2017 - is the latest to be conducted in defiance of a UN ban. US President Donald Trump called it ""only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime"". Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said that initial indications showed the latest missilehad a range of about 10,000km,external- far enough to strike the west coast of the United States and beyond. The Washington Postreported,externalthat Denver and possibly Chicago could now be in North Korea's range. How the US might defend itself Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un? The latest missile was launched at 23:41 (15:41 GMT) from an arms plant in Jagang province in the north of the country, the Pentagon said. It is unusual for North Korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear. No missileshad been fired from Jagang province before,external, indicating a previously-unknown launch site is operational. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew for about 45 minutes - some six minutes longer than the ICBM tested in early July. Is ICBM test a game-changer? What the outside world can do NHK said it reached an altitude of about 3,000km - about 200km higher than the previous ICBM. It landed about 1,000km from the launch site, the Pentagon said. ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries. In the latest reaction: South Korea's President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency security meeting for the middle of the night Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did the same, saying: ""The threat to Japan's security has become grave and real"" Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said: ""We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation"" Despite ongoing tests, experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Does N Korea have the bomb? Others, however,believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US. This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? The US has installed a missile defence system in South Korea to combat the threat from the North, but the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) has angered many in the region, especially China. South Korea's president said he wanted to hold talks with the US on deploying more of the Thaad units in the wake of the latest tests, Yonhap reported. What can the outside world do about N Korea?

"This video can not be played Eleven-month-old Charlie Gard was at the centre of a legal battle over his treatment Charlie Gard, the baby at the centre of a legal row over his treatment, has died, a family spokesman has confirmed. The 11-month-old was moved to a hospice following a High Court ruling. He suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness. His parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, fought a lengthy legal battle with Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) to allow him to be taken to the US for treatment. But on Monday they dropped their legal battle after Prof Michio Hirano, the American neurologist who had offered to treat him, said it was too late for it to work. The tragic case of Charlie Gard In a statement issued on Friday evening, Ms Yates said: ""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I am deeply saddened by the death of Charlie Gard. My thoughts and prayers are with Charlie's parents Chris and Connie at this difficult time."" Pope Francis tweeted: ""I entrust little Charlie to the Father and pray for his parents and all those who loved him."" GOSH said it sent its ""heartfelt condolences"" to Charlie's parents and loved ones. US Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted: ""Saddened to hear of the passing of Charlie Gard. Karen & I offer our prayers & condolences to his loving parents during this difficult time."" Chris Gard and Connie Yates fought a five-month legal battle on behalf of their son On Thursday, Ms Yates said the couple had been denied their ""final wish"" to have more time with him after a High Court judge ruled that he would be moved to a hospice and have his life support withdrawn soon after. The couple had wanted to take their son to the US for nucleoside bypass therapy, but specialists at GOSH said the treatment was experimental and that Charlie had irreversible brain damage.

Hundreds of people - called Charlie's Army - lent their support to his parents, who raised Â£1.35m to take him to the US for treatment. The couple fought a legal battle for five months, in which judges from the High Court, Supreme Court and the European Court all agreed with doctors that the treatment would not benefit Charlie. Charlie's plight attracted the attention of Pope Francis and US president Donald Trump. Charlie has been in intensive care since October Following the European Court ruling, thePope said he was following the case""with affection and sadness"". In a statement released earlier this month, the Vatican said: ""For them he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored."" The US president then offered his support, tweeting: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."" After his tweet, Prof Hirano co-signed a letter with other medical experts which suggested unpublished data showed therapy could improve Charlie's brain condition. They claimed that ""ideally"" the treatment would first be tested on mice but said that, in Charlie's case, there was no time for such a trial. After examining Charlie a couple of weeks ago, Prof Hirano said it was too late for the treatment to work. An MRI scan had shown there was no muscle at all in parts of his body. HIs parents have described him as an ""absolute warrior"" Paying tribute to their son following the end of their legal challenge the couple, both in their 30s and of Bedfont, west London, had described him as an ""absolute warrior"". On Monday Mr Gard said: ""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you. ""We had the chance but we weren't allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby.

"The UK's top mermaids are gathering this weekend in Northampton to battle it out for the national Miss Mermaid crown. But just what is it that motivates someone to don a tail and morph into a creature that is half-woman, half-fish? The BBC has dived into this unusual world to find out more. Grace, the current Miss Mermaid UK, went to the world finals in Egypt last year ""Like most young girls growing up, I always wanted to be a mermaid,"" says reigning Miss Mermaid UK, 25-year-oldGrace Page, from Reading. ""I've always had a passion for singing, and, since a young age I've loved having long naturally blonde hair, and the sea fascinates me - so creating a career around actually performing as a mermaid just made so much sense. ""I was slightly apprehensive about being Miss Mermaid UK; after my minimal pageant experience I didn't know how I would fare against professional mermaids from around the world. But Miss Mermaid International really is different to anything you've ever thought about pageants. Whilst in Egypt [where the international finals are held] a huge focus of what we did was giving back to the community and raising awareness for marine conservation. ""We visited local schools, did litter picks at the beaches and removed litter from the sea and reefs and even put together some awareness videos. Grace, who runs her own ""hire a mermaid"" business, says being a professional mermaid is a ""huge investment"" ""You cannot deny the sensuality of mermaids, but you can be both a magical, innocent inspiration for children and an alluring siren; it's all about how you hold yourself. My persona, and the aura I give off, is obviously completely different at a children's party than if I'm draped at the side of a pool for 'decoration' at a VIP event. ""If you want to be a professional mermaid it is essential that you train as a free diver and hold a free diving qualification. This will allow you to be able to hold your breath for longer periods of time and, more importantly, you will be able to do so safely. ""Becoming a professional mermaid is a huge investment - tails, training, insurance, marketing and so much more - not to mention the amount of time it takes out of your life if you're serious. As with all skilled and entertainment jobs you need to have a passion for it to succeed. ""Today's society is such a varied and colourful place; everyone wants to be able to express themselves in their own unique way. ""Does the human race need a mermaid beauty pageant? No. Is it a way to bring interest and magic back to a dark and difficult world? Absolutely!"" Hannah: ""We have a big merfolk community"" ""Miss Mermaid is about raising awareness of marine conservation, and bringing ocean creatures to life is a great way to talk about the impact of plastic and pollution,"" says Miss Mermaid Norfolk, 35-year-oldHannah Griffiths. ""It's about spreading some mermaid magic: making people smile but delivering a message from the deep too. ""People like to escape the daily grind or endless bad news stories to something magical and different. This crosses all oceans, and all oceans connect the world. ""We have a big 'merfolk' community who want to help protect the world's oceans."" Natalia: ""There always will be loads of opinions about whether mermaids are sexualised or innocent"" ""For me, mermaids are the spirit of nature and dreams,"" says Miss Mermaid London, 32-year-oldNatalia Suvorova. ""You have to have some skills, but to become a mermaid you need to be a dreamer, get to the water with a tail, be a good swimmer, have fun and be yourself. ""Mermaids are fun, playful and friendly creatures. ""It is a great way to raise awareness about the cleanliness of water, and how people are affecting oceans of the world. ""There always will be loads of opinions about whether mermaids are sexualised or innocent, but as mermaids are magical creatures I think this helps kids and adults to believe in miracles."" Gina: ""I enjoy being a mermaid because I can be extra magical, unusual and different"" ""I like being a mermaid because it is something that I have always thought of myself as,"" says Miss Mermaid Berkshire, 33-year-oldGina Coyle. ""When I was younger I was always a mermaid in the bath and I had an Ariel Barbie doll I adored, and it is something I have never grown out of. ""I enjoy being a mermaid because I can be extra magical, unusual and different and it feels amazing being able to swim in my tail like the mermaid I am. ""Miss Mermaid UK is a complete step up from a usual pageant [with] the amazing charity funding we are doing to help with our oceans and sea life. It also helps people to become more aware that we mermaids are out there and anything is possible! ""I see the the image of the mermaid as I would a woman, except more magical. Mermaids have been depicted as a murderous siren but also as a strong-willed princess, and all in between. ""This sort of pageant has taken off around the world for the very reason that it is magical, different and positive. There are a lot of girls and boys dreaming of meeting a real-life mermaid and I think it's something that you don't grow out of. ""There is a permanent fascination and there always will be."" Sophie: ""I've always wanted to be a mermaid or a fairy"" ""As a child I always wanted to be a mermaid or a fairy because they felt delicate but powerful, which was how I wanted to be as an adult,"" says Miss Mermaid South Coast 20-year-oldSophie Loy. ""I don't immediately see the mermaid image as something sensual, I see it as magical and a way for children and adults to express themselves. But, as the mermaid's original image before the Disney recreation [The Little Mermaid] was of temptresses luring men off boats to their deaths, I think it could be seen as both. ""When I applied to be part of the pageant I never imagined that I would be accepted, let alone win a title. ""I am only 4ft 9ins (1.45m) and I am very alternative-looking which I thought would set me back quite far in the competition. But when I arrived to compete, everyone was so kind and accepting of everyone else, our differences were celebrated and we were encouraged to show our personalities on stage."" The word mermaid is a compound of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman) The first stories appeared in about 1,000BC in Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover Explorer Christopher Columbus claimed to have spotted three mermaids in 1493 - historians believe these were probably manatees Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens approaching doomed ships, or, at best, a sign of rough weather ahead Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Little Mermaid was first published in 1837, and tells the story of a young mermaid who falls in love with a prince she saves from drowning The Fiji Mermaid was a famous hoax that featured in 19th Century showman PT Barnum's American Museum, which was actually the torso of a young monkey sewn on to the lower half of a fish The Miss Mermaid UK final takes place at Billing Aquadrome in Northampton on Saturday.

"This video can not be played Leo Varadkar will not design 'border for Brexiteers' The Irish government will not design a border for Brexiteers, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has said. He said his government did not want to see any kind of economic border on the island of Ireland when the UK leaves the European Union. Mr Varadkar said he hoped unionists in Northern Ireland would not respond angrily to his position. He is due to visit Northern Ireland next week. ""It is the British and the Brexiteers who are leaving, so if anyone should be angry it's us quite frankly,"" he added. Brexit and the 'hardest' border What does Brexit mean for the Irish border? ""But we are not going to get angry. ""We are going to try and find solutions or at least minimise the damage to relations between Britain and Ireland, to the peace process and to trading links."" Finding a solution to the Irish border issue is one of the main challenges of Brexit Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney denied a newspaper report that suggested the Irish government preferred a sea border. The Times report suggested Mr Varadkar wanted customs and immigration checks at ports, rather than any checks along the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Sources told the paper that Mr Varadkar believes a land border would jeopardise the peace process. This video can not be played Fergal Keane speaks to people on both sides of the border about Brexit The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described the suggestion as ""madness"". DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That's just not going to happen. ""There is no way that the DUP would go for an option that put a border between one part of the UK and another. This video can not be played Follow the road that cuts across the Irish border four times inside six miles ""That would be a bit like saying we're going to create a border between California and the rest of the USA. ""I think what Dublin needs to think about is innovative ways in which it can move its market closer to the UK."" Sir Jeffrey claimed that 64% of goods exported by the Republic of Ireland go to the UK. But that figure is incorrect - exports to the UK amounted to 12.8% of trade in 2016, according to the Irish government. This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today idea of a sea border between Ireland and UK is ""absurd"" Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Mr Varadkar's comments were ""totally irresponsible"". ""If the taoiseach thinks he is going to use the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to make a name for himself he should think again,"" he added. However, Mr Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ: ""There is no proposal that is suggesting that there be a border in the Irish Sea."" Unionists have said that any movement of the border between the UK and Ireland will not happen The Irish foreign minister said the onus was on the UK to ""come up with imaginative and if necessary unique solutions"" to avoiding a so-called hard border. The Irish border is one of the key issues that needs to be resolved by the UK and the EU before talks begin on a new trade deal. Mr Coveney said a political solution was required, rather than a technical fix, which has been suggested by Brexit Secretary David Davis. Mr Davis has proposed using measures like surveillance cameras to allow free movement between the north and south of the island. Mr Coveney insisted his government colleagues will not support proposals that result in checkpoints along the Irish border. The onus is on the UK to come up with a solution for the Irish border, said Simon Coveney Addressing reporters on Friday afternoon, the taoiseach said both he and Mr Coveney were on the same page on the issue. But Mr Varadkar added that if the UK government wants technological solutions to the border that was up to them. He said the Irish government would not do that work for them. Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams supported Mr Varadkar's remarks and said he should support a campaign for Northern Ireland to be granted special status within the EU. ""The taoiseach should should tell both the British government and the EU negotiating team that this is the best solution to the economic, political and social challenges that Ireland faces from Brexit,"" Mr Adams added. In the 2016 referendum, the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU but in Northern Ireland, 56% of the electorate voted to remain.

"This video can not be played Women practise saying their husband's name (courtesy of Video Volunteers) Millions of Indian women have never used their husband's name - it's a way of showing their respect for him. The tradition is strictly observed in rural areas, though much less so in cities. Now, however, some campaigners are urging women in villages to give it up too. What's in a name? A lot, if you're an Indian wife and the name in question is your husband's. I learned this early on in life. My parents were married for 73 years until my father died last year. At the time of their wedding, my mother was less than 11 and he had just turned 15. In the decades they were together, first in a tiny village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and later in Kolkata (then Calcutta), she never called him by his name. When speaking to us children, she always referred to him as ""babuji"" - the Hindi word for ""father"" that we used. When addressing him directly, she always said ""Hey ho"", which means roughly ""Hey you"". As teenagers when we became aware of the fact, we made fun of her. We tried to trick her into saying his name just once. But she never did. My parents were married for 73 years but my mother never called my father by his name All the other women in my home and neighbourhood also avoided saying their husband's name. So did tens of millions of women across India, regardless of their religion or caste. That's because in traditional Indian society, the husband is equated with god and a woman is taught from a young age that she must respect him. She is told that naming her husband could invite bad luck and shorten his life. Often the ban extends to other members of his family too - and the consequences of breaking it can be serious. One woman in the eastern state of Orissa faced retribution that was swift and harsh. ""One day my sister-in-law asked who was sitting outside. I named all the men who were there, including my husband's uncle,"" Malati Mahato says in a film produced by Video Volunteers, a pressure group. Malati Mahato was punished for naming a member of her husband's family The sister-in-law complained to the village council, which ruled Mahato's words ""reprehensible"" and she was banished, with her children, to a home on the edge of the village. For the past 18 months she has been ostracised by the other villagers. ""The patriarchal hierarchy is enforced at many levels,"" says social anthropologist, Prof A R Vasavi. ""The husband is considered equal to god so he has to be worshipped. In traditional matches he's generally from a higher caste and economically supports the wife so he's theyajman- the owner. And he's generally older, so has to be respected on that count too."" Women may use ""father of so-and-so"" or refer to their husband's profession, eg ""doctor sahib"" or ""vakil (lawyer) sahib"" They may just say ""hey you"", or ""you"", ""will you please listen"", or ""are you listening?"" In some Indian languages it is common to say ""brother"", ""elder brother"", ""hello"" or ""owner"" Video Volunteers has now begun a campaign in some rural communities in an attempt to change patriarchal traditions. Last October, Rohini Pawar, a volunteer in a village near the western city of Pune decided to raise the issue of naming husbands at a women's discussion group in her village. But before doing so, she decided she had better try it herself. Pawar told the BBC that she was married at 15 and that in 16 years of marriage had never called her husband Prakash by his name. ""Earlier I'd call him 'baba', because his nephews called him that. Or I'd just say 'aaho' ('you' in the local Marathi language) to grab his attention."" Prakash was relaxed about it but most other villagers weren't happy. Some ridiculed the couple. Rohini Pawar: People ask us why is it so important for us to use their names The women in the discussion group, however, were delighted with the idea. ""We had great fun. We laughed a lot that day. For the first time in our life, we were shouting out our husbands' names,"" says Pawar, laughing. ""We decided to make a video and asked the women to say it in three different ways - happily, with anger, and with love. ""One of the women got carried away. She went home giddy with excitement and as soon as she saw her husband, she screamed out his name - and he slapped her. ""He told her that if she ever dared to say his name again, he would give her a solid beating."" In Indian cities, over time, it has become common for wives to name their husbands. With growing female literacy, more and more women joining the workforce, and love marriages often replacing arranged ones, the tradition began to seem out-of-date. When I married, my husband was a work colleague. I had called him by his name for years, so it would have made no sense to stop after the wedding. But A R Vasavi says this still only applies to a ""very small segment"" of Indian households. ""It's the educated, assertive woman in big cities who calls her husband by name,"" she says. ""It's unthinkable for tens of millions of women in rural India and even in conservative urban homes. If a new bride tries to go against the tide, she's swiftly admonished by her mum-in-law or other elderly women."" Rohini Pawar says the hostile response from many in her village has only strengthened the resolve of the women in her group to continue challenging patriarchal traditions. ""You see, change is not easy. People ask us why is it so important for us to use their names - what's the big deal?"" she says. ""I think, until you confront the small issue, how will you challenge the larger, more important issues?"" It may seem like a small step, but it's the first step, she says, and the first step is always a big one.

"North Korea said it conducted its first ICBM test in early July - the latest took place late at night North Korea has conducted a new intercontinental ballistic missile test, South Korea and the Pentagon say. The missile reached an altitude of about 3,000km (1,865 miles) and landed in the sea off Japan, the Japanese national broadcaster NHK said. It comes three weeks after North Korea's first ICBM test. In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said. The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said. The latest North Korean missile flew higher, further and for longer than the one in early July. Its launch has been condemned by a number of countries. The test - the 14th carried out by North Korea in 2017 - is the latest to be conducted in defiance of a UN ban. US President Donald Trump called it ""only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime"". Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said that initial indications showed the latest missilehad a range of about 10,000km,external- far enough to strike the west coast of the United States and beyond. The Washington Postreported,externalthat Denver and possibly Chicago could now be in North Korea's range. How the US might defend itself Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un? The latest missile was launched at 23:41 (15:41 GMT) from an arms plant in Jagang province in the north of the country, the Pentagon said. It is unusual for North Korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear. No missileshad been fired from Jagang province before,external, indicating a previously-unknown launch site is operational. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew for about 45 minutes - some six minutes longer than the ICBM tested in early July. Is ICBM test a game-changer? What the outside world can do NHK said it reached an altitude of about 3,000km - about 200km higher than the previous ICBM. It landed about 1,000km from the launch site, the Pentagon said. ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries. In the latest reaction: South Korea's President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency security meeting for the middle of the night Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did the same, saying: ""The threat to Japan's security has become grave and real"" Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said: ""We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation"" Despite ongoing tests, experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Does N Korea have the bomb? Others, however,believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US. This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? The US has installed a missile defence system in South Korea to combat the threat from the North, but the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) has angered many in the region, especially China. South Korea's president said he wanted to hold talks with the US on deploying more of the Thaad units in the wake of the latest tests, Yonhap reported. What can the outside world do about N Korea?

"Rene TkÃ¡Äik was a ""hugely experienced"" worker Companies working for Crossrail have been fined Â£1m for three sets of failures, one of which led to the death of a construction worker. RenÃ¨ TkÃ¡Äik, 44, died as nearly a tonne of wet concrete was poured on to him. The two other incidents saw a worker injured when a tipper truck crushed his leg, while another man was injured when a high pressure mixture struck him. At Southwark Crown Court the companies admitted the health and safety breaches. BFK - joint venture contractors comprising of BAM Nuttall, Ferrovial Agroman (UK) and Kier Infrastructure and Overseas - were fined Â£300,000 in relation to Mr TkÃ¡Äik; Â£600,000 for the serious leg injuries to Terrence Hughes and Â£165,000 for the injuries Alex Vizitiu who hurt his head and suffered hip injuries. They were taken to court by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). HSE head of operations Annette Hall said: ""Had simple measures... been taken, all three incidents could have been prevented, and RenÃ¨ TkÃ¡Äik may not have died. ""All three workers were taking part in one of the most important and challenging infrastructure projects of the decade. It was this joint venture's duty to protect its dedicated and highly-skilled workforce. ""On these three occasions, BFK failed in its duty, with tragic consequences for RenÃ¨ TkÃ¡Äik and his family."" During sentencing, Judge Beddoe said: ""The fines I impose do not and cannot attempt to place value on human life. ""The deceased was a very talented and industrious man who devoted his life to his family, in particular his daughter, his wife and his mother."" At Mr TkÃ¡Äik's inquest, the court heard that he was a ""hugely experienced"" worker when he died in 2014. He had been working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter Esther to go to university, a statement from his wife Renata said.

"The US embassy has been told to cut its staffing levels Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties. The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington. The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats. The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election. They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs."" The US expulsion of Russian diplomats ""clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms"", it added. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Russia and US bid to end diplomatic row It was not immediately clear how many diplomats and staff members would have to stop working at the embassy, but Russian news agencies quoted sources as saying ""hundreds"" of people would be affected. Russia has banned US diplomats from this dacha at Serebryany Bor on Moscow's outskirts And Russia is seizing this US diplomatic warehouse in Moscow Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed US embassy official as saying the embassy employed about 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including US and Russian citizens. Russia also said it would respond in kind if Washington decided to expel any more Russian diplomats. Russia's move comes a day after President Vladimir Putin decried what he called ""anti-Russian hysteria"" in Washington. The new US sanctions on Russia were overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress despite objections from the Trump White House. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Trump and now there are several investigations looking into whether anyone from his campaign helped. Russia has always denied interfering and Mr Trump insists there was no collusion.

"This video can not be played Leo Varadkar will not design 'border for Brexiteers' The Irish government will not design a border for Brexiteers, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has said. He said his government did not want to see any kind of economic border on the island of Ireland when the UK leaves the European Union. Mr Varadkar said he hoped unionists in Northern Ireland would not respond angrily to his position. He is due to visit Northern Ireland next week. ""It is the British and the Brexiteers who are leaving, so if anyone should be angry it's us quite frankly,"" he added. Brexit and the 'hardest' border What does Brexit mean for the Irish border? ""But we are not going to get angry. ""We are going to try and find solutions or at least minimise the damage to relations between Britain and Ireland, to the peace process and to trading links."" Finding a solution to the Irish border issue is one of the main challenges of Brexit Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney denied a newspaper report that suggested the Irish government preferred a sea border. The Times report suggested Mr Varadkar wanted customs and immigration checks at ports, rather than any checks along the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Sources told the paper that Mr Varadkar believes a land border would jeopardise the peace process. This video can not be played Fergal Keane speaks to people on both sides of the border about Brexit The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described the suggestion as ""madness"". DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That's just not going to happen. ""There is no way that the DUP would go for an option that put a border between one part of the UK and another. This video can not be played Follow the road that cuts across the Irish border four times inside six miles ""That would be a bit like saying we're going to create a border between California and the rest of the USA. ""I think what Dublin needs to think about is innovative ways in which it can move its market closer to the UK."" Sir Jeffrey claimed that 64% of goods exported by the Republic of Ireland go to the UK. But that figure is incorrect - exports to the UK amounted to 12.8% of trade in 2016, according to the Irish government. This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today idea of a sea border between Ireland and UK is ""absurd"" Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Mr Varadkar's comments were ""totally irresponsible"". ""If the taoiseach thinks he is going to use the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to make a name for himself he should think again,"" he added. However, Mr Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ: ""There is no proposal that is suggesting that there be a border in the Irish Sea."" Unionists have said that any movement of the border between the UK and Ireland will not happen The Irish foreign minister said the onus was on the UK to ""come up with imaginative and if necessary unique solutions"" to avoiding a so-called hard border. The Irish border is one of the key issues that needs to be resolved by the UK and the EU before talks begin on a new trade deal. Mr Coveney said a political solution was required, rather than a technical fix, which has been suggested by Brexit Secretary David Davis. Mr Davis has proposed using measures like surveillance cameras to allow free movement between the north and south of the island. Mr Coveney insisted his government colleagues will not support proposals that result in checkpoints along the Irish border. The onus is on the UK to come up with a solution for the Irish border, said Simon Coveney Addressing reporters on Friday afternoon, the taoiseach said both he and Mr Coveney were on the same page on the issue. But Mr Varadkar added that if the UK government wants technological solutions to the border that was up to them. He said the Irish government would not do that work for them. Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams supported Mr Varadkar's remarks and said he should support a campaign for Northern Ireland to be granted special status within the EU. ""The taoiseach should should tell both the British government and the EU negotiating team that this is the best solution to the economic, political and social challenges that Ireland faces from Brexit,"" Mr Adams added. In the 2016 referendum, the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU but in Northern Ireland, 56% of the electorate voted to remain.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond tells Radio 4's Today a Brexit ""transitional deal"" must end by 2022 Any ""transitional deal"" in the period after Brexit must end by June 2022, the time of the next general election, Philip Hammond has said. But the chancellor said there must be ""business as usual, life as normal"" for Britons as the UK left the EU. ""Many things would look similar"" the day after Brexit - on 29 March 2019 - as the UK moved gradually towards a new relationship with the EU, he said. The EU has said it is too soon to discuss a transitional deal. A European Commission spokesman said: ""We are about to discuss the specifics of separation and once this is done to the satisfaction of everyone, we may move to the second step."" The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019 but there has been increasing talk of a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" stage to smooth the process, before a new long-term relationship with the EU comes into force. Free movement 'to end in 2019' James Landale: Time to end Brexit metaphors Irish 'will not design Brexiteer border' David Davis plays down trade talks delay claims Reality Check: Migration to the UK All you need to know about Brexit This could mean a period during which some EU rules would continue to apply to the UK after it has technically left the bloc. Newspaper reports have suggested these could include the free movement of people, something that was seen as a key issue in the vote to leave the EU. Mr Hammond also appeared to acknowledge that it could mean new trade deals with non-EU countries could not be signed during that period. The chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the length of any transitional deal would ""be driven by technical considerations"". Beneath the surface, Chancellor Philip Hammond had been arguing for a transitional arrangement to avoid choppy waters in 2019. There is no longer any dissent in the ranks - that concept has been agreed by the Cabinet. In return, the chancellor has acceded to demands by ministers who voted to leave the EU that any transitional phase must be completed by the scheduled date of the next general election - June 2022. But have other disagreements so far escaped the political sonar? Read more from Iain On Thursday, immigration minister Brandon Lewis said it was a ""simple matter of fact"" that EU free movement rules would not apply after 2019. Mr Hammond said this was correct because freedom of movement was an EU concept and the UK would leave the customs union and single market on 29 March 2019. But he said the question that needed answering was what happened next, so that British people and businesses could ""get on with their lives"" without ""massive disruption"". He said he hoped that, in the immediate aftermath, goods would ""continue to flow across the border between the UK and the EU in much the same way as they do now"". On whether EU citizens would continue to be free to enter the UK, he said it would be ""some time before we are able to introduce full migration controls between the UK and the European Union"". ""That's not a matter of political choice, it's a matter of fact. We have to put in place quite a lot of new infrastructure, we will need a lot of new people, we will need new IT systems... This is going to take a while to deliver."" Businesses must not be faced with a ""cliff edge"" after Brexit, Mr Hammond said He said Britons wanted to know they would still be able to ""go about their business"" after March 2019, from buying European goods to going off on holiday, adding: ""The government's job is to make sure that our economy can go on functioning normally, that people can go about their businesses as usual... that is our focus."" Some of Mr Hammond's colleagues who campaigned for a Leave vote have accepted that an ""implementation period"" after Brexit is likely. The Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Nigel Evans said any transition period should end as soon as the UK had arrangements in place, saying: ""This is not going to be seen as a ruse whereby some people who might have liked us to remain in the European Union can see this as an opportunity to keep us half in. ""That's not going to happen. We are, in all but one or two transitional arrangements, going to have left the European Union by March 2019."" ""New infrastructure"" will be needed for migration controls, Mr Hammond said Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had been calling for ""appropriate transitional arrangements"" which the chancellor ""now appears to accept"". ""However, in light of the clear divisions this week within the Cabinet, I hope the chancellor was not merely speaking in a personal capacity,"" he said. ""I also hope that this is the final burial of the flawed proposition that 'no deal' is a viable option."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said a transition period was only ""kicking the can down the road"". ""All the problems associated with a hard Brexit, leaving the single market, leaving the customs union, they will simply be confronted two years later."" Meanwhile, Malta's PM Joseph Muscat has said he is ""starting to believe that Brexit will not happen"",according to the Guardian.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Mazie Hirono said she was one of the lucky ones with health insurance The latest attempt to repeal the Obama-era healthcare act has failed after a dramatic night in the US Senate. At least three Republicans - John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski - voted against the bill, which needed a simple majority to pass. President Donald Trumpsaid,externalthe three had ""let the American people down"". The so-called ""skinny"" repeal, which would have scaled back some of the more controversial provisions, is the third failed attempt to repeal Obamacare. It would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026, with insurance premiums increasing by 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Where Trump went wrong on healthcare The vote was delayed after Senate Republicans kept a procedural vote open before the actual Obamacare vote while they attempted to persuade their members to vote for the repeal. Vice President Mike Pence was seen talking to Mr McCain for more than 20 minutes. But Mr McCain then approached a group of Democrats, who appeared happy to see him. The bill was eventually voted down by 51 votes to 49 in the Republican-dominated Senate. 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country Why is Obamacare so controversial? Is Obamacare more popular than ever? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, described the result as a ""disappointing moment"". Democrat Chuck Schumer said his party was relieved that millions of people would retain their healthcare. The arc of history is long, but it bends towards revenge. Just over two years after candidate Donald Trump mocked John McCain's Vietnam War record, noting that he prefers heroes ""who weren't captured"", the Arizona senator stuck a dagger in President Trump's healthcare reform plans. There were gasps when Mr McCain, after being furiously lobbied by Vice-President Mike Pence, joined two other Republican senators in voting against the so-called ""skinny"" repeal plan, considered the bare minimum Senate Republicans could agree on. Instead of a big step toward becoming law - either in its skinny form or after further negotiations with the House of Representatives - the future of Obamacare repeal has been thrown into doubt. The reality is, for now, there is no minimum level of change on which Senate Republicans can agree. They either have to work with Democrats or resign themselves to stalemate and move on to other topics, like taxes or infrastructure spending. It will take some time for the scale of this late-night Senate drama to sink in. No one really expected Mr McCain to be the decisive vote, but the man who once had a reputation as a Republican ""maverick"", now facing a dire brain cancer diagnosis, had at least one more surprise in his pocket. The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more. It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations. But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals. A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place. The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it. Sen McCainsaid,externalhe had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans. Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski also voted against the repeal He added that House Speaker Paul Ryan's assurance that the House would be willing to send the bill for further consideration by committee ""did not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time"". There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress. However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year. Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."" This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself. In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of ""collapse"", with healthcare premiums ""skyrocketing"" and providers ""fleeing the marketplace"". He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to ""return to the correct way of legislating"" with input from both parties. ""We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve,"" he said. But Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted the fight was not over. ""Mark my words, this journey is not yet done,"" he said.

The Great British Bake Off winner told Good Housekeeping magazine she fell in love with her husband Abdal after marrying him at the age of 19. But Hussain said she needed to ""move with the times"" with her own children. The mother-of-three, 32, said: ""I don't think [my children] need me to find them a husband or a wife. They will do a better job than I will."" Bake Off's Nadiya cooks up own food show Nadiya Hussain -  Muslim, Bangladeshi, British and proud Bake Off's Nadiya had 'token Muslim' fears Talking about her arranged marriage, Hussain said: ""It's tough - you are pretty much marrying a complete stranger."" She added: ""I had an arranged marriage, and learnt you have to persevere and remember we are all human and all have faults... ""We had to live through the good and the bad, and have come out the other side. Love is strange... it creeps up on you and then smacks you in the face. ""I didn't know my husband, and then we had two children, and then I fell in love with him."" Since winning Bake Off, Hussain has appeared in her own food series, The Chronicles Of Nadiya, and started writing a recipe column for the Times newspaper. Hussain's new BBC TV show,Nadiya's British Food Adventure,began this month. Last year, Hussain told Radio 4'sDesert Island Discsthat she was never pressured into marrying a stranger. ""My dad always gave us options, he never said you have to marry a particular person, they never put that pressure on us,"" she said. Hussain said she had met husband Abdal once before their wedding day - on the day of their engagement - but they had spoken for six months over the phone. ""I asked all the right questions,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Women practise saying their husband's name (courtesy of Video Volunteers) Millions of Indian women have never used their husband's name - it's a way of showing their respect for him. The tradition is strictly observed in rural areas, though much less so in cities. Now, however, some campaigners are urging women in villages to give it up too. What's in a name? A lot, if you're an Indian wife and the name in question is your husband's. I learned this early on in life. My parents were married for 73 years until my father died last year. At the time of their wedding, my mother was less than 11 and he had just turned 15. In the decades they were together, first in a tiny village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and later in Kolkata (then Calcutta), she never called him by his name. When speaking to us children, she always referred to him as ""babuji"" - the Hindi word for ""father"" that we used. When addressing him directly, she always said ""Hey ho"", which means roughly ""Hey you"". As teenagers when we became aware of the fact, we made fun of her. We tried to trick her into saying his name just once. But she never did. My parents were married for 73 years but my mother never called my father by his name All the other women in my home and neighbourhood also avoided saying their husband's name. So did tens of millions of women across India, regardless of their religion or caste. That's because in traditional Indian society, the husband is equated with god and a woman is taught from a young age that she must respect him. She is told that naming her husband could invite bad luck and shorten his life. Often the ban extends to other members of his family too - and the consequences of breaking it can be serious. One woman in the eastern state of Orissa faced retribution that was swift and harsh. ""One day my sister-in-law asked who was sitting outside. I named all the men who were there, including my husband's uncle,"" Malati Mahato says in a film produced by Video Volunteers, a pressure group. Malati Mahato was punished for naming a member of her husband's family The sister-in-law complained to the village council, which ruled Mahato's words ""reprehensible"" and she was banished, with her children, to a home on the edge of the village. For the past 18 months she has been ostracised by the other villagers. ""The patriarchal hierarchy is enforced at many levels,"" says social anthropologist, Prof A R Vasavi. ""The husband is considered equal to god so he has to be worshipped. In traditional matches he's generally from a higher caste and economically supports the wife so he's theyajman- the owner. And he's generally older, so has to be respected on that count too."" Women may use ""father of so-and-so"" or refer to their husband's profession, eg ""doctor sahib"" or ""vakil (lawyer) sahib"" They may just say ""hey you"", or ""you"", ""will you please listen"", or ""are you listening?"" In some Indian languages it is common to say ""brother"", ""elder brother"", ""hello"" or ""owner"" Video Volunteers has now begun a campaign in some rural communities in an attempt to change patriarchal traditions. Last October, Rohini Pawar, a volunteer in a village near the western city of Pune decided to raise the issue of naming husbands at a women's discussion group in her village. But before doing so, she decided she had better try it herself. Pawar told the BBC that she was married at 15 and that in 16 years of marriage had never called her husband Prakash by his name. ""Earlier I'd call him 'baba', because his nephews called him that. Or I'd just say 'aaho' ('you' in the local Marathi language) to grab his attention."" Prakash was relaxed about it but most other villagers weren't happy. Some ridiculed the couple. Rohini Pawar: People ask us why is it so important for us to use their names The women in the discussion group, however, were delighted with the idea. ""We had great fun. We laughed a lot that day. For the first time in our life, we were shouting out our husbands' names,"" says Pawar, laughing. ""We decided to make a video and asked the women to say it in three different ways - happily, with anger, and with love. ""One of the women got carried away. She went home giddy with excitement and as soon as she saw her husband, she screamed out his name - and he slapped her. ""He told her that if she ever dared to say his name again, he would give her a solid beating."" In Indian cities, over time, it has become common for wives to name their husbands. With growing female literacy, more and more women joining the workforce, and love marriages often replacing arranged ones, the tradition began to seem out-of-date. When I married, my husband was a work colleague. I had called him by his name for years, so it would have made no sense to stop after the wedding. But A R Vasavi says this still only applies to a ""very small segment"" of Indian households. ""It's the educated, assertive woman in big cities who calls her husband by name,"" she says. ""It's unthinkable for tens of millions of women in rural India and even in conservative urban homes. If a new bride tries to go against the tide, she's swiftly admonished by her mum-in-law or other elderly women."" Rohini Pawar says the hostile response from many in her village has only strengthened the resolve of the women in her group to continue challenging patriarchal traditions. ""You see, change is not easy. People ask us why is it so important for us to use their names - what's the big deal?"" she says. ""I think, until you confront the small issue, how will you challenge the larger, more important issues?"" It may seem like a small step, but it's the first step, she says, and the first step is always a big one.

The incident happened during the morning rush hour at the Francia station, in the city centre. Reports said the train did not brake properly when entering the station, hitting the buffers at the platform. Dozens of emergency personnel were sent to the station, with most of the injured being treated on the platform. Emergency services said as well as the seriously wounded person, who does not have life-threatening injuries, 19 people were moderately hurt. They are being treated in hospital. Among them is the driver, who is said to be in a state of shock. The remainder were lightly injured. Emergency personnel treated some of the injured on the platform Reports suggested many of those injured in the busy train had been standing, ready to alight The state-run firm operating the train said an investigation had been opened The media were on the scene almost as quickly as the emergency services - here interviewing a passenger named Lidia ""At the moment of impact I had the feeling of experiencing an earthquake,"" one passenger, Lidia,told La Vanguardia newspaper (in Spanish),external. She said she had been in the front carriage. ""People were swaying back and forth and colliding into each other. Many people fell to the ground because people were standing up and I saw several people with cuts to the head and face from the blows they suffered when they fell."" Among those hurt were three citizens from France and Romania, local authorities said. Their respective consulates have been informed. The accident happened at 07:15 (05:15 GMT) after the train had travelled from the village of Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders, some 60km (37 miles) to Barcelona's south-west.

"Like the thin twig of peace, the Brexit metaphor has been stretched to melting point. It should be taken round the back of the paragraph and quietly put out of its misery. Since Britain voted to leave the European Union, politicians and commentators have deployed everything from cakes, cherries, cats, even golf clubs to try to explain what it might all mean. Yet, in recent weeks, it has become clear that many of these analogies have become absurd and redundant. The head of the UK's public spending watchdog, Sir Amyas Morse, compares Brexit to ""a chocolate orange"" that might fall apart at the first tap. The Tory MP Charlie Elphicke fears a ""Hotel California"" Brexit where ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"". The businessman Lord Wolfson likens Brexit to a frantic bus journey where the passengers are fighting over its speed and direction. And Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, the international lawyer and wife of the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, compares Brexit on her food blog to a strawberry pudding: ""The crumble, just like Brexit, seems fine on the outside, though if you look attentively you can see that there is a mess bubbling up inside. And it will definitely fall apart when you serve it, no matter how hard you try."" Enough, please. Enough. In the beginning, there was some sense in using metaphor to explain a complex issue. Brexit was ""soft"" if it involved continued membership of the single market or customs union, ""hard"" if it meant the opposite. Theresa May then muddied the waters by uttering these words: ""I'm interested in all these terms that have been identified - hard Brexit, soft Brexit, black Brexit, white Brexit, grey Brexit - and actually what we should be looking for is a red, white and blue Brexit."" Brexit was compared to marital separation because it allowed people to distinguish between Britain's immediate exit from the EU - the ""divorce"" - and its longer-term trading relations. But the comparison was stretched to unsustainable lengths, with discussion about who gets to divide the music collection and keep the children and so on. To Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, Brexit resembles a fruit crumble There was also the small problem that in this divorce one side was made up of 27 different nations. Is ""Mutti"" Merkel the mother in this metaphor and the other 26 countries her children? Up to a point, Dr Freud. The prime minister told MPs in March she did not like the ""divorce"" metaphor. ""I prefer not to use that term with regard to the European Union because often, when people get divorced, they do not have a good relationship afterwards."" So her dutiful Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, steered away from marital matters and chose a metaphor closer to his stomach than his heart. He declared that when it came to Brexit, he wanted Britain to ""have its cake and eat it"". The EU countered with its own gastronomic analogy, saying that ""cherry picking"" the best bits of the EU would not be tolerated. Brexit risks being 'chocolate orange' May: Dinner row claim is Brussels gossip Again these clichÃ©s made some sort of sense at first but later became rather silly. I went to a seminar recently where someone declared - without irony - that Britain did not want to have its cake and eat it, it just did not agree with the EU what the recipe for the cake should be. The debate about how much money the UK should pay when it exits the EU has prompted many figurative contortions. Some in Britain argued that when one leaves a golf club, one should stop paying the direct debit and certainly not fork out for another round of green fees. But the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, insisted over dinner with Theresa May in April that the EU was ""not a golf club that could be easily joined or left""; it was a family, and Brexit should be treated as divorce. The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, was more prosaic, comparing Britain's outstanding payments to a round of drinks, telling the Financial Times that ""it would be wrong for EU taxpayers to be asked to pay Britain's bar bill"". Is Brexit a full-blown divorce or a mere settling of domestic accounts? On the other side of Brussels, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, disagreed, declaring: ""There is no Brexit bill. The financial settlement is only about settling the accounts."" The problem is that this only adds to the confusion. To a French speaker, ""settling the accounts"" means no more than Britain paying its debts. To an English speaker, it can just as easily mean the EU seeking its revenge. Take the Daily Telegraph's Allister Heath, for example, who wrote that by demanding billions of euros from the UK, the EU was trying to impose war reparations. ""The last time this sort of idiocy was attempted was in 1919, at the Treaty of Versailles, when a defeated Germany was ordered to accept full responsibility for the war and to pay vast reparations to the allied powers."" This video can not be played May: Iâm ambitious for what we can achieve The problem with these metaphors is that they confuse the point of the financial dispute, namely how much Britain should pay for EU spending in the future, and not just for its current and past obligations. Unless, of course, confusion is the point, a little creative ambiguity to nudge the negotiations along. And still the metaphor-fest has rolled on. Mr Verhofstadt - him again - has described Brexit as a ""catfight in the Conservative Party that got out of hand"". Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected French president, has said the UK is finding out that Brexit was ""no walk in the park"". The respected commentator, Philip Collins, wrote recently in The Times, that ""leaving the European Union is a SchrÃ¶dinger's cat kind of problem"". Such is his confidence in the intelligence and knowledge of Times' readers that Mr Collins chose not to offer a word of explanation. Those of us unfamiliar with this particular feline had to reach for Google to discover it refers to a thought problem asking if it is possible to hold two contradictory truths at the same time. The EU chief negotiator's reference to hilly climbs strike may have struck a chord with the prime minister At a recent news conference, Michel Barnier went on a flight of metaphorical Brexit fancy when he revealed that he, like Theresa May, also enjoyed hill walking. ""If you like walking in the mountains you have to learn a number of rules. You have to learn to put one foot in front of the other because sometimes you are on a steep and rocky path. You also have to look [at] what accidents might befall you - falling rocks."" He added: ""You have to be very careful to keep your breath. You have to have stamina because it could be a lengthy path and you have to keep looking at the summit."" This is very practical or very deep. Either way, it is very French. And it is certainly too much. Can we just agree that Brexit means Brexit and leave it at that?

"This video can not be played 'Where I grew up, we're front stabbers' The new communications director for US President Donald Trump has launched a strongly-worded attack on the White House chief of staff. Anthony Scaramucci was scathing about ""paranoid schizophrenic"" Reince Priebus,in a phone conversation,externalwith a reporter from The New Yorker magazine. He was upset that the reporter, Ryan Lizza, had tweeted about who Mr Scaramucci was dining with. The former Wall Street financier also attacked Trump aide Steve Bannon. The conversation with Mr Lizza was littered with profanity-laced insults directed at Mr Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Scaramucci later tweeted his regret at the ""colourful language"". He did not deny the nature of the conversation as it was reported but said he ""made a mistake in trusting a reporter"". ""It won't happen again,"" he tweeted. Mr Scaramucci has spent much of his first week in the White House railing against ""leakers"" and hinted in interviews that he thinks the chief of staff is one of them.

""If Reince wants to explain that he's not a leaker, let him do that,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. President Trump has said that leaks from the White House are a national security threat and must stop. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Mr Scaramucci recently told the BBC he saw Donald Trump as a disruptive president, elected to tear the established order apart. What's more, the newly minted White House communications director appears more than happy to help foment the chaos. In his obscenity-laced interview, he clearly draws battle lines between himself and his White House opponents - Mr Priebus and Mr Bannon, in particular. His comments are going to make it difficult for the Trump administration to operate in any semblance of a normal fashion in its current composition. The problem, however, is that it will be almost impossible to show Mr Scaramucci the door so early in his tenure - it would be a tacit admission the president made a mistake in hiring him. The I-told-you-so's from the Priebus crowd would be deafening. Mr Scaramucci could find some unrelated excuse to bow out - business concerns, perhaps - but that doesn't seem the pugnacious New Yorker's style. The other option is for the West Wing bloodletting to continue. Given that Scaramucci dined with the president and Fox News firebrand Sean Hannity last night, before the latest round of ""disruption"" began, Mr Trump may be A-OK with this. The tensions between two of his top aides appeared to be made public when Mr Scaramucci tweeted on Wednesday night that his government financial disclosure form had been leaked. The tweet, which he subsequently deleted, ended by tagging Mr Priebus' Twitter handle. This video can not be played Watch: Anthony Scaramucci's full Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis Mr Priebus, who formerly chaired the Republican National Committee, and former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, had reportedly opposed the hiring of Mr Scaramucci. Who is Anthony Scaramucci? Mr Spicer announced his resignation on the same day that Mr Scaramucci was hired. ""I don't know if [my relationship with Mr Priebus] is repairable or not,"" said Mr Scaramucci on Thursday. ""That will be up to the president."" On his first day in the job last week, he told reporters that he and the chief of staff were personal friends who like to ""rough each other up"" once in a while. ""But he's a dear friend,"" he added. Sarah Sanders, the press secretary who reports to Mr Scaramucci, told reporters after the phone tirade surfaced that any apology would have to happen ""personally between them"". ""He used some colourful language that I don't anticipate he'll do again,"" she said of her boss. Ms Sanders had earlier described the nature of the two aides' relationship as ""healthy competition"". Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who is the highest-ranking Republican member of Congress, told reporters on Thursday: ""If those two men have differences, my advice would be to sit down and settle those differences.""

"Pakistan's Supreme Court recommended an anti-corruption case against Mr Sharif Nawaz Sharif has resigned as prime minister of Pakistan following a decision by the country's Supreme Court to disqualify him from office. The ruling came after a probe intohis family's wealthfollowing the 2016 Panama Papers dump linkingMr Sharif's children to offshore companies. Mr Sharif has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the case. The five judges reached a unanimous verdict in the Islamabad court, which was filled to capacity. ""Following the verdict, Nawaz Sharif has divested himself of his responsibility as prime minister,"" a spokesman for Mr Sharif's office said in a statement. However, it said he had ""serious reservations"" about the judicial process. There was heightened security in the capital, with tens of thousands of troops and police deployed. The court's ruling stated that Mr Sharif had been dishonest in not disclosing his earnings from a Dubai-based company in his nomination papers during the 2013 general election. One of the judges, Ejaz Afzal Khan, said that Mr Sharif was no longer ""eligible to be an honest member of the parliament"". Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan earlier advised Mr Sharif to accept Friday's verdict. The court has recommended anti-corruption cases against several individuals, including Mr Sharif, his daughter Maryam and her husband Safdar, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and others. Pakistan PM's case marred by controversy Nawaz Sharif's Panamagate explained How a font exposed 'fake' documents Hashtags and puns as Pakistan PM resigns By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Pakistan has repeated history. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is resigning. He was the 18th prime minister of Pakistan. Not a single one of the 17 prime ministers that preceded him have completed their full term in office. Many believe that the Supreme Court has started a process of cracking down on corruption, which augurs well for democracy. Others see this as part of a long history of political manipulation through which the country's powerful military establishment has sought to control civilian decision-making. The case hearings - spread over nearly 15 months - have been marred by controversy. The case belongs in a criminal court. The Supreme Court, which is an appellate body, initially refused to hear it. But then it not only admitted the petition for hearing, it also took the unusual step of instituting its own investigation into the case, with a dominant role for military intelligence services. Many believe that while across-the-board action against corruption may remain a pipe dream, this verdict will open the gates of power for a new set of politicians - as has often happened in the past. Mr Sharif, who was serving as prime minister for a record third time, was less than a year away from becoming the first in Pakistani history to complete a full term in office. He served as prime minister from November 1990 to July 1993 and from February 1997 until he was toppled in a bloodless coup in October 1999. Opposition supporters erupted in applause as the verdict was announced Head of the Jamaat-e-Islami group, Siraj ul Haq (left), shares sweets with opposition supporters Allegations of corruption have dogged Mr Sharif since the 1980s. And much of what the Panama Papers revealed was the subject of a federal inquiry in the mid-1990s. It is not immediately clear who will succeed Mr Sharif, but his brother Shehbaz, who is chief minister of Punjab province, is seen as a strong contender for the job. Pakistan's ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), will be permitted by the speaker of the National Assembly to select an interim prime minister to rule until the 2018 general election. The PML-N, which has the most seats in parliament, is expected to deliver a statement later on Friday. Opposition parties will also have the opportunity to put forward their own candidates for the position. Meanwhile, the court has directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the main anti-corruption body, to compile and send four references to accountability courts against Mr Sharif and others. The NAB has been directed to file these references within six weeks. The accountability courts have been directed to complete hearings in these cases in six months. The leaks in April 2016revealed that three of Mr Sharif's children owned offshore companies and assets not shown on his family's wealth statement. The companies were allegedly used to channel funds to acquire foreign assets, including some apartments along Park Lane in London's Mayfair area. Despite documents from the Panama Papers suggesting that the beneficial owner of the luxury central London flats was Mr Sharif's daughter Maryam, she later claimed that she was only a trustee - and that it was her brother who was the beneficial owner. To prove her point, Maryam Nawaz produced a trust deed signed by both her and her brother dated February 2006. But a British forensic expert later said the documentwas ""fake"" or had been ""falsified"" because it was typed in the Calibri font, which was not commercially available until 2007. The insinuation that the offshore companies were meant to hide or launder ill-gotten wealth or to avoid taxes called Mr Sharif's credentials into question. Sharif's son defends offshore companies Profile: Nawaz Sharif Local media on Friday showed crowds assembled outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad cheering the court's verdict. As the verdict was announced, opposition supporters erupted in applause, rushing into the street chanting slogans and handing out sweets, according to reports. The vice-chairman of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) party, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, called it an ""historic day"" and praised the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) for ""not succumbing to the enormous pressure and serving the cause of justice."" The verdict was announced amid heightened security in the capital, with about 3,000 armed police and members of the Pakistan Rangers paramilitary force deployed near and around the Supreme Court. There was a large security presence outside Pakistan's Supreme Court ahead of the ruling The ruling represents the peak of a drama that has fuelled news coverage and social media debates for months, attracting both scorn and ridicule as well as trenchant support for the prime minister. The divisions fall largely along party lines but amid the febrile accusations, many have also expressed concerns over Pakistan's political culture. The Wikipedia profile of the prime minister has also been littered with obscenities and accusations. Mr Sharif is not the first prime minister to lose his position following the leaking of documents from the Panamanian law firm. Iceland's prime minister wasforced to resignafter documents appeared to reveal that he and his wife concealed millions of dollars' worth of investments in an offshore company.

"Kings Transport in Melbourne now has an all-electric fleet The clock may be ticking for petrol and diesel-powered cars, but it's vans, trucks and buses that are driving the electric vehicle revolution on the world's roads. This week the UK governmentfollowed Francein announcing it wouldban the sale of such vehicles by 2040, while the mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens plan to banish diesels from their city centres by 2025. Almost all car makers now offer hybrid cars and many sell fully electric vehicles. But the electric charge also extends to vans and trucks, and the need to switch to cleaner engines is even greater given that these larger vehicles are far bigger polluters than cars. ""In Europe, less than 5% of vehicles are commercial vehicles or heavy duty trucks, but they contribute to almost 20% of greenhouse gas emissions,"" says Ananth Srinivasan, mobility expert with research consultancy Frost & Sullivan. Even in a country with wide open spaces like Australia, the electric wave is rolling out. Melbourne-based logistics firm Kings Transport recently bought nine electric vans and light trucks fromSEA Automotive,external. SEA chief executive Tony Fairweather says his firm realised a few years ago that electric commercial vehicles were becoming economically viable much faster than predicted. ""The components are cheaper every time we go to buy,"" he explains. ""There's not many industries where that happens."" SEA's platform can be used for a variety of electric commercial vehicles Beyond Australia, electric commercial vehicles are becoming an increasingly common sight. In Germany, for example, Deutsche Post has started building its own electric vans and will soon start selling them to other companies. Meanwhile, in the US, the city of Los Angeles plans to make its entire bus fleet emissions-free by 2030. The International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that keeping global temperature rises below 2C by the end of the century will in part depend on the electrification of some 600 million vehicles worldwide. Given there are more than 300 million commercial vehicles on the planet's roads, according to data portal Statista, it is clear that this goal need not be focused solely on passenger cars. SEA's approach involves fitting its own electric driveline technology to a chassis built by China's FAW. Big vehicle makers are also developing their own electric systems for commercial vehicles, including Nissan, with its e-NV200 fully electric van. How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market Who is the slowest and laziest player in your team? Meet the 'doctors' who will talk to you whenever you like Many light commercial vehicles often travel similar routes every time they leave the depot, Mr Fairweather and others point out. So businesses with depots can invest in installing their own charging stations. ""You can get super cheap electricity late at night,"" says Simon Evans, deputy editor of Carbon Brief. But if everyone starts charging their trucks and vans overnight, electricity consumption dynamics could change dramatically, he warns. ""You are basically sticking a massive great electricity demand into a new place,"" he says. If millions of new electric vehicles do hit the road in the coming years, electricity grids around the world will have to adapt. The UK's National Grid is already evaluating the impact of a potential boom in electric cars. However, the range of electric cars remains an issue. For smaller commercial vehicles travelling those relatively fixed urban routes, that is not too much of a concern. But larger trucks travelling long distances pose a much tougher challenge. Jersey Post took delivery of 15 Nissan e-NV200 electric vans last year Battery technology is still not good enough, although hybrid designs such as the one being tested by Volvo, which allows for intermittent recharging, could help. There are even experiments in which long stretches of road have been electrified with overhead cables to power large trucks en route. Lighter commercial vehicles remain the most likely to go electric in the near term, with the UK leading the way. That seems appropriate given that electric milk floats were once a common early morning sight across the country. Denis Naberezhnykh, of the UK'sTransport Research Laboratory,external, says the government recently awarded Â£20m to a wide range of low emission freight and logistics projects - including several electric vehicle ventures. But even without government support, companies and local authorities are already investing in such vehicles. Some London routes now have only electric buses, for example. ""There's a whole bunch in Milton Keynes and Bristol, all over the place there's really quite a large number of areas committed to the electrification of buses,"" says Mr Naberezhnykh. ""Operators that would have traditionally operated hybrid buses are now seeing cost savings."" This video can not be played A fleet of ""revolutionary"" electric buses are being introduced in Bristol In countries where infrastructure threatens to hold back the introduction of electric vehicles, interesting adaptations are being considered. Take India, for instance, which has an ambitious plan to electrify six million vehicles by 2020. An Indian truck-maker recently proposed a system for simply swapping electric buses' batteries with fully charged ones to keep them running for longer. But it's worth remembering that a similar battery-swapping venture for passenger cars, called Better Place,went bust in Israel four years ago,externalafter burning through at least $500m (Â£380m). Other city services seem especially well suited for electrification. One of Mr Fairweather's upcoming projects at SEA is a new design for electric refuse trucks, which are cropping up in many places. Sacramento's electric garbage truck is expected to save 6,000 gallons of fuel a year Mr Naberezhnykh says councils in the UK are already expressing interest, partly because electric trucks are much quieter. The first such vehiclewent into service in Sacramento,external, the California state capital, in June. Many governments and businesses around the world are clearly interested in the electrification of commercial vehicles. Some projects may be more tentative than others, but it's obvious that organisations are taking advantage of their unique position. Unlike most car owners, they can often afford to absorb the initial cost of going electric - and make the business case for fuel savings down the road. Frost & Sullivan's Ananth Srinivasan says it it easier for freight fleet owners to justify investment in electric vehicles because ""when they look at the cost for miles travelled over, say, two years with an electric van versus one powered by petrol or diesel"", the financial benefits are obvious.

"Cladding and insulation used in at least 60 tower blocks will be deemed to have failed a new fire safety test, the BBC understands. The test was more thorough thanprevious checks after the Grenfell Tower fire, which only tested cladding. The new test checked the cladding in combination with the foam insulation that was used in Grenfell. Nine blocksin Salfordare the only local authority-owned buildings so far known to be affected. Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said buildings owned by housing associations and private sector landlords will also be on the list. The location of some of the tower blocks may not be disclosed to the public because of intellectual property rights connected to the cladding systems involved. At least 80 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington on 14 June. Cladding put on Grenfell Tower in 2015 is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire in the 24-storey block, which started in a fridge on the fourth floor. Previous tests of cladding and insulation carried out in the wake of the fire were done by turning the material used to make them into powder and setting it off with a spark. But the newest test was done in real-world conditions, where cladding and insulation is built on a vertical rig and set alight. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Corporate manslaughter warning over Grenfell Work to start on covering Grenfell Tower What happened at Grenfell Tower? The mock-up used a so-called PIR plastic foam, a type of combustible insulation, and aluminium panels with a combustible polyethylene plastic core. This is the most flammable of the six combinations of insulation and cladding that will be tested. Previously the core of cladding from tower blocks was tested, but Lord Porter said: ""It was fairly evident from the Grenfell fire that there was more than just the panels that was a fire risk on that building."" Salford Council hadalready said it expected its towers to fail. The nine blocks built in the 1960s were re-clad recently with shiny coloured panels and insulation, to cut energy bills. One resident told the BBC it was ""like sitting on a tinderbox"". The test rig at the BRE before the aluminium cladding was installed, with silver foil covering the insulation Crisis management expert Prof Edward Borodzicz said: ""For the people who live in these buildings, this must be extremely concerning."" He added there could be a case for evacuating people from towers with unsafe cladding and insulation combinations. Salford has already begun removing cladding from the towers. Salford Council is already removing cladding from nine of its buildings It is likely to cost the authority tens of millions of pounds and it is asking for help from central government. Lord Porter said he hoped the Treasury would provide some of the money required by local authorities to replace cladding. Chancellor Phillip Hammond said lack of funding would not get in the way of making buildings safe. He suggested some local authorities and housing associations would have reserves to fund the works, or be able to borrow money. Separately, a man has denied pretending his family died in the Grenfell Tower fire in order to get money from the victim relief fund. Anh Nhu Nguyen, 52,pleaded not guilty to two counts of fraud by false representationat Southwark Crown Court. Mr Nguyen, of Beckenham, south-east London, is accused of posing as a victim for about a fortnight, in order to allegedly obtain Â£10,000 from Kensington and Chelsea Council and charities. It is claimed he was given a hotel room, food, electrical items and cash at the relief hub. He was remanded in custody and his trial is expected to take place in early December.

"Steven Slater had been a diver for 28 years A British diver has died exploring a wreck off the American coast. Steven Slater, from Gateshead, was taking part in a group excursion to the Andrea Doria, 60 nautical miles southeast of Nantucket, when he got into difficulties on Monday. The 46-year-old was pulled unconscious from the water by the crew of the dive charter boat and CPR was administered, but he was later pronounced dead. East Hampton Police said the official cause of death is yet to be determined. His family said: ""We are all heartbroken but draw comfort knowing he was doing something that he loved."" In 2011, Steven Slater laid a wreath in the sea to commemorate a World War One wreck His friend Mark Dixon, who runs a dive boat out of Newcastle, said: ""Steve was one of the UK's leading divers and over his 28 years of diving he had achieved some very notable dives, including the ground-breaking Empress of Britain dive in 541ft (165m) of water in 2011 with the Darkstar dive team. ""Steve's real passion was discovering wrecks off his native north east coast and over the years he has identified over 50 wrecks, often through meticulous research. ""A regular contributor to diving and shipwreck conferences, Steve was well known in the UK deep diving community for his diving and his research but most of all for his sense of humour and generosity of spirit. ""He will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him."" Andrea Doria was an Italian luxury liner which sank in July 1956 following a collision with a Swedish liner in thick fog. Since then, it has become known as the ""Everest of Wreck Diving"" after more than a dozen divers have died exploring the wreck, which lies at a depth of 240ft (73m).

"Pakistan's Supreme Court recommended an anti-corruption case against Mr Sharif Nawaz Sharif has resigned as prime minister of Pakistan following a decision by the country's Supreme Court to disqualify him from office. The ruling came after a probe intohis family's wealthfollowing the 2016 Panama Papers dump linkingMr Sharif's children to offshore companies. Mr Sharif has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the case. The five judges reached a unanimous verdict in the Islamabad court, which was filled to capacity. ""Following the verdict, Nawaz Sharif has divested himself of his responsibility as prime minister,"" a spokesman for Mr Sharif's office said in a statement. However, it said he had ""serious reservations"" about the judicial process. There was heightened security in the capital, with tens of thousands of troops and police deployed. The court's ruling stated that Mr Sharif had been dishonest in not disclosing his earnings from a Dubai-based company in his nomination papers during the 2013 general election. One of the judges, Ejaz Afzal Khan, said that Mr Sharif was no longer ""eligible to be an honest member of the parliament"". Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan earlier advised Mr Sharif to accept Friday's verdict. The court has recommended anti-corruption cases against several individuals, including Mr Sharif, his daughter Maryam and her husband Safdar, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and others. Pakistan PM's case marred by controversy Nawaz Sharif's Panamagate explained How a font exposed 'fake' documents Hashtags and puns as Pakistan PM resigns By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Pakistan has repeated history. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is resigning. He was the 18th prime minister of Pakistan. Not a single one of the 17 prime ministers that preceded him have completed their full term in office. Many believe that the Supreme Court has started a process of cracking down on corruption, which augurs well for democracy. Others see this as part of a long history of political manipulation through which the country's powerful military establishment has sought to control civilian decision-making. The case hearings - spread over nearly 15 months - have been marred by controversy. The case belongs in a criminal court. The Supreme Court, which is an appellate body, initially refused to hear it. But then it not only admitted the petition for hearing, it also took the unusual step of instituting its own investigation into the case, with a dominant role for military intelligence services. Many believe that while across-the-board action against corruption may remain a pipe dream, this verdict will open the gates of power for a new set of politicians - as has often happened in the past. Mr Sharif, who was serving as prime minister for a record third time, was less than a year away from becoming the first in Pakistani history to complete a full term in office. He served as prime minister from November 1990 to July 1993 and from February 1997 until he was toppled in a bloodless coup in October 1999. Opposition supporters erupted in applause as the verdict was announced Head of the Jamaat-e-Islami group, Siraj ul Haq (left), shares sweets with opposition supporters Allegations of corruption have dogged Mr Sharif since the 1980s. And much of what the Panama Papers revealed was the subject of a federal inquiry in the mid-1990s. It is not immediately clear who will succeed Mr Sharif, but his brother Shehbaz, who is chief minister of Punjab province, is seen as a strong contender for the job. Pakistan's ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), will be permitted by the speaker of the National Assembly to select an interim prime minister to rule until the 2018 general election. The PML-N, which has the most seats in parliament, is expected to deliver a statement later on Friday. Opposition parties will also have the opportunity to put forward their own candidates for the position. Meanwhile, the court has directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the main anti-corruption body, to compile and send four references to accountability courts against Mr Sharif and others. The NAB has been directed to file these references within six weeks. The accountability courts have been directed to complete hearings in these cases in six months. The leaks in April 2016revealed that three of Mr Sharif's children owned offshore companies and assets not shown on his family's wealth statement. The companies were allegedly used to channel funds to acquire foreign assets, including some apartments along Park Lane in London's Mayfair area. Despite documents from the Panama Papers suggesting that the beneficial owner of the luxury central London flats was Mr Sharif's daughter Maryam, she later claimed that she was only a trustee - and that it was her brother who was the beneficial owner. To prove her point, Maryam Nawaz produced a trust deed signed by both her and her brother dated February 2006. But a British forensic expert later said the documentwas ""fake"" or had been ""falsified"" because it was typed in the Calibri font, which was not commercially available until 2007. The insinuation that the offshore companies were meant to hide or launder ill-gotten wealth or to avoid taxes called Mr Sharif's credentials into question. Sharif's son defends offshore companies Profile: Nawaz Sharif Local media on Friday showed crowds assembled outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad cheering the court's verdict. As the verdict was announced, opposition supporters erupted in applause, rushing into the street chanting slogans and handing out sweets, according to reports. The vice-chairman of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) party, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, called it an ""historic day"" and praised the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) for ""not succumbing to the enormous pressure and serving the cause of justice."" The verdict was announced amid heightened security in the capital, with about 3,000 armed police and members of the Pakistan Rangers paramilitary force deployed near and around the Supreme Court. There was a large security presence outside Pakistan's Supreme Court ahead of the ruling The ruling represents the peak of a drama that has fuelled news coverage and social media debates for months, attracting both scorn and ridicule as well as trenchant support for the prime minister. The divisions fall largely along party lines but amid the febrile accusations, many have also expressed concerns over Pakistan's political culture. The Wikipedia profile of the prime minister has also been littered with obscenities and accusations. Mr Sharif is not the first prime minister to lose his position following the leaking of documents from the Panamanian law firm. Iceland's prime minister wasforced to resignafter documents appeared to reveal that he and his wife concealed millions of dollars' worth of investments in an offshore company.

"Barclays has set aside an extra Â£700m to meet compensation claims for mis-selling payment protection insurance. The news came asthe bank said,externalcosts related to the sale of part of its Africa unit had pushed it into a Â£1.2bn loss in the first half of the year. The sale of the Africa business was part of Barclays' plan to focus on the UK and US. Stripping out the losses from the Africa sale, Barclays posted a 13% rise in group pre-tax profits to Â£2.34bn. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said: ""Our business is now radically simplified, the restructuring is complete, our capital ratio is within our end-state target range, and, while we are also working to put conduct issues behind us, we can now focus on what matters most to our shareholders: improving group returns."" The money the bank has set aside to deal with PPI complaints was still open to review, it said. On Thursday, Lloyds alsoset aside a further Â£700m. The PPI scandal is not only big - banks have set aside a total of nearly Â£40bn to pay compensation - it is also long-running. Over the next few months the pace of it is likely to keep accelerating. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will run a campaign to encourage those mis-sold PPI to make claims before the deadline of August 2019. You can expect more activity too from the claims management companies touting for business through calls and texts. They take a cut of any payouts made to claimants who use their services. Banks wanted a earlier deadline. They want to draw a line under this saga. It is almost impossible to judge how much PPI was mis-sold - so they will also hope these latest provisions have over-estimated the final bill. Earlier this year, Barclays sold a near 34% stake in Barclays Africa Group, leaving it with just 15% of the business. The company said the sale of the stake had led to a loss of Â£1.4bn, and it had also taken a Â£1.1bn charge on the sale. Barclay's Africa Group said on Friday its half-year profit rose 7% driven by earnings growth in its local market and the rest of Africa and a strong performance in corporate banking. In addition to Barclays' exit from Africa, the bank said it had run-down assets in its non-core division to below Â£25bn, enabling it to close the unit six months early. Mr Staley said Barclays had completed ""two critically important planks"" of its strategy to get out of unwanted businesses. Santander, also a giant in the UK banking market,reported results on Friday,external. For the first six months of the year pre-tax profits in the UK were Â£1bn, little changed on the same period last year. The firm said that it sees ""greater uncertainty"" and has concerns about the rest of this year and the start of 2018. The lender said: ""The labour market remains strong, but higher inflation, largely from the lower value of sterling, is now reducing households' real earnings. ""This is likely to result in lower consumer spending growth which, when combined with a potentially more challenging macro environment, adds a degree of caution to our outlook."" It took a Â£69m charge to cover claims for payment protection insurance compensation in the first six months of the year. Santander also said net mortgage lending fell by Â£200m after it withdrew some of its most competitive rates at the end of last year. The Banco Santander group as a whole saw second quarter net profit jump by 37% to Â£1.75bn euros (Â£1.5bn) helped by strong growth in South America.

"Abigail Austen, speaking to Channel 4 President Trump faces a ""firestorm of litigation"" over his proposed ban on transgender US military personnel, a British transgender officer says. Abigail Austen told Channel 4 no employment tribunal would support President Trump's proposed ban. Mr Trump said transgender personnel would burden the US military with ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". Ms Austen is Britain's first transgender Army officer. She said: ""When you're sat there in a foxhole, what you really want to know is if the person next to you has got your back. ""That doesn't matter... whether you're a man, woman or a giraffe - it's whether you have the talent to do the job."" She also said that, according to a report published last year, at least 2,500 transgender individuals in the US military came forward in the past year. Ms Austen said they ""will now be looking for some kind of succour from the Pentagon and from the White House itself as to where their direction and their fate now now lies"". She added: ""If President Trump doesn't sort this, he will face a firestorm of litigation. ""I can't think of employment tribunal anywhere in the world that will support what is effectively a dismissal policy conducted over social media."" Ms Austen is about to serve in Afghanistan as part of the Nato mission there. Mr Trump says costs and disruption drove his proposed ban on transgender people in the military Mr Trump made his announcement on Wednesdayin a series of tweets,,externalin which he said: ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail"". Former RAF pilot Ayla Holdom, who began transitioning in 2010, has praised UK defence leaders for publicly supporting their transgender staff. UK Maritime Forces Rear Admiral Alex Burton said: ""I am so glad we are not going this way."" Second Sea Lord Vice AdmiralJonathan Woodcock tweeted,externalthat he was ""proud"" of the Royal Navy's transgender personnel. Ms Holdom, who piloted a search and rescue helicopter for seven years, said supportive comments matter ""hugely"". ""These people deserve respect,"" she added. ""We have a better service and a stronger team by being diverse, by not all being the same."" The Obama administration decided last year to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military.
