"In between news and views from the campaign trail - we focused on ""What the world wants from America"" We had special global coverage looking at how things have changed under Trump, and how people see the future US President Donald Trump headed to the battleground state of Pennsylvania later Melania pulled out of her first public appearance since her Covid bout, due to a ""lingering cough"" Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will have their microphones muted for part of their final pre-election debate on Thursday Edited by Rebecca Seales We're pausing our US election live coverage for the day, now just two weeks from polling day on 3 November. Already, a record 29 million ballots have been cast nationwide. So what were the big moments from today?  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina. Monday's live page was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Victoria Bisset, Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Rebecca Seales, Ritu Prasad, Georgina Rannard and Holly Honderich - with our team of correspondents around the world. If you're sick of politics by this point, here's something else to turn your gaze towards: the prospect of an asteroid skirting by our planet the day before the election! It's a story fit for 2020, but no need to panic yet. The fridge-sized space rock isn't big enough to do any damage. ""It currently has a 0.41% chance of entering our planetâs atmosphere, but if it did, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size,"" according to Nasa. As astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson put it: ""If the World ends in 2020, it wonât be the fault of the Universe."" But wait, there's more asteroid-related news! Nasa's planning a daring probe ""high-five"" with the asteroid Bennu. At 510m-wide (that's larger than the Empire State Building), be glad the hunk of rock is some 330 million km away from Earth.

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world. Posters for Sean Combs' 'Vote or Die' initiative have been seen in New York City Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. Read her full analysis on how a Biden win might change US foreign policy here. And read up about who China really wants to win the election here. As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

Michael Ware says he's not keen on either candidate What do American truckers think of the presidential choice ahead? The industry employs 3.6 million drivers, and truckers are seen as a visible part of the culture of middle America.BBC OS on BBC World Service radio has been speaking to a group of them. Michael in Arizona has been driving refrigerated food trucks for 23 years. ""I'm not all that keen on either one of the candidates. I know I'm not a Trump supporter. I don't know enough about Biden to feel comfortable enough to say 'he's my guy',"" he says. Pat in Indianapolis flies a Trump flag outside his house. ""Joe Biden's been a politician for 47 years and if you don't know anything about him now, what are you hoping to learn? ""Over the last several elections, we're voting for the lesser of the evils."" All the drivers agree that homelessness is something they see a lot. ""I go to LA every week, by the downtown,"" says Sunny in California. ""You see slum areas, under the bridges. I don't think anybody's fixing that. It feels like they don't even look at it."" He wants a candidate who can help him feel safer at work. ""My vote goes to the person doing something for trucking."" Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

I don't know enough about Biden to feel comfortable enough to say 'he's my guy',"" he says. Pat in Indianapolis flies a Trump flag outside his house. ""Joe Biden's been a politician for 47 years and if you don't know anything about him now, what are you hoping to learn? ""Over the last several elections, we're voting for the lesser of the evils."" All the drivers agree that homelessness is something they see a lot. ""I go to LA every week, by the downtown,"" says Sunny in California. ""You see slum areas, under the bridges. I don't think anybody's fixing that. It feels like they don't even look at it."" He wants a candidate who can help him feel safer at work. ""My vote goes to the person doing something for trucking."" Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond.

Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Greater Manchester will move into Tier 3 Greater Manchester will move to England's highest tier of coronavirus restrictions from Friday at 00:01 BST, the prime minister has announced. Speaking at No 10, Boris Johnson said ""not to act now"" would put the lives of Manchester's residents ""at risk"". He said a ""generous"" offer of financial support had been made to the region but that Mayor Andy Burnham had refused it. Mr Burnham said he had not been offered enough to ""protect the poorest people in our communities"". Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. 'Heartbreak' over region's tier 3 status What Covid tier is my area in? What will the Tier 3 rules for Greater Manchester be? Kuenssberg: Greater Manchester deal falls over a Â£5m gap Ahead of the Downing Street press conference, Mr Burnham - speaking alongside other local leaders - said that without a ""bare minimum"" of Â£65m in additional business support, tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"" among the region's 2.8 million population. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later told the House of Commons that a Â£60m offer previously made to local leaders remained ""on the table"". This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' On the inability to agree on financial help, Mr Johnson said: ""I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together."" He added Greater Manchester would receive Â£22m in funding as part of a ""comprehensive package of support"" but that the ""door was open to continue the conversation"" about further aid, so long as it was in line with that offered to other areas in same position. The Â£22m mentioned by Mr Johnson - which is for expenses such as local enforcement and test and trace - is separate to the Â£60m that Mr Hancock spoke of. In addition, thenew Job Support Schemewill cover 67% of the wages - funded by employers and the government - of people affected by tier three closures. Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North"" (as some now call him)? All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Explaining the decision to impose tougher restrictions on Greater Manchester, Mr Hancock said hospital admissions in the region were higher now than at the end of March. ""There are now more Covid-19 patients in Greater Manchester hospitals than in the whole of the South West and the South East combined,"" he added. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, meanwhile, said residents of Manchester would be ""watching the news in disbelief"". He said they would be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party would force a Commons vote on Wednesday, demanding a ""fair deal"" for areas facing tier three restrictions. Allow Twitter content?

Conservative MP Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook that Bolton had ""been through a far tougher lockdown than Tier 3 and it didn't work"". He added: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't."" However, six other Conservative MPs from the region havewritten to Mr Burnham,externalto express their ""concern and deep disappointment"" about what they called ""his failure to come to an agreement with the Government"" on a support package. The signatories ask Mr Burnham to ""make way"" for ""local MPs and council leaders"" to ""have a go at getting a sensible settlement"". Kate Nicholls - the head of industry body UKHospitality - described the move to tier three as ""another huge blow for our sector and a very bitter disappointment for hospitality businesses in Manchester"". ""We need a practical and workable package of support for the whole of Manchester's hospitality sector in order to keep these businesses afloat and jobs alive,"" she said. ""Jobs, once lost, are not always easily revived and businesses closed not easily reopened."" Meanwhile, the PM confirmed that conversations were ongoing with leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East about the possibility of moving to the very high alert level, tier three. The leaders of West Yorkshire's council later said a decision had been made to maintain tier two status in the county this week. It comes as the latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The rising case numbers in England have led some scientists and politicians to call for aso-called ""circuit breaker""- a short, sharp lockdownsuch as that being brought in for Wales. But speaking alongside Mr Johnson at Downing Street, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said this approach would be ""inappropriate"" for parts of England where the disease was lower and ""very hard to justify for some communities"". In Wales, people will be told to stay at home from Friday, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shutas part of the ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. And in Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's.

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the top level of England Covid restrictions Businesses in Greater Manchester fear some may not survive as the area is moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions. It has followed Liverpool City Region and Lancashire intotier three. Businesses including pubs and bars, unless they serve substantial meals, as well as soft play facilities, betting shops and casinos will have to close on Friday just after midnight. The move has been met with anger, frustration and upset by businesses. Live reaction to the latest Covid measures What is the three-tier system? What Covid tier is my area in? The owner of a Menagerie Restaurant and Bar, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre, said consumer confidence had been knocked by the confusion over coronavirus restrictions. Karina Jadhav said she was allowed to stay open, but have to close anyway as people stay away ""We have been operating under restrictions, which are close to tier three for three months now,"" said Karina Jadhav. ""While we are allowed to stay open, the restrictions, the confusion and the communication coming from the government has really reduced consumer confidence. ""This has resulted - for us - in a lot of cancellations, people not booking, people wanting refunds. ""So while we are allowed to stay open, we are being restricted to the point where it is difficult to keep the business open in the current circumstances."" The managing director of Wythenshawe-based Whitehouse Event Crockery said the situation was ""heartbreaking"". Marc Gough said he had a viable business but had been forgotten by government The business, which supplies goods including plates and glassware for weddings and events, will not be forced to close down in tier three. However, the move to the toughest tier of measures would have a direct effect on the number of bookings, said Marc Gough. ""Weddings cannot take place in a tier three environment, so effectively they are stopping us from working with no financial support,"" he said. ""This is a viable business - a very successful, viable business - and we have just had no support from the government. ""We have been simply forgotten and it's heartbreaking."" Greater Manchester recorded almost 11,000 new cases in the week to 16 October, according to data updated on Monday. Latest figures show cases rose across most of Greater Manchester in the week to 16 October. However, the city of Manchester has so far seen a fall compared with the week before. Even so, it still has a high rate of new cases, with just under 404 per 100,000 people in the week to last Friday. Rochdale recorded Greater Manchester's highest rate with 462 cases per 100,000 residents. Stockport and Trafford have the lowest rates in Greater Manchester, with 266 per 100,000 and 310 per 100,000 respectively. The managing director of a bar in Burnage said it was going to be a ""tough winter"" as the hospitality industry adjusted to the new three-tier system. Elena Rowe, pictured right with her colleague Sean Gregson, said it had been a frustrating time for the business ""It's really sad. We have done everything we can to keep safe,"" said Elena Rowe, from Reasons to be Cheerful. Reasons to be Cheerful will be among the pubs to close under tier three. ""We have regulars and a lot of them drink on their own, and the space we provide is their bubble and it's sad that this is going to end for people. ""It's going to be a tough winter. I'm frustrated and upset,"" said Ms Rowe. The owner of a bar in the heart of Manchester's gay village said tier three would also force him to close. John Hamilton warned that businesses were fading away and he called for help John Hamilton, who runs Bar Pop and employees 60 members of staff, said: ""I am so upset. The city centre will be like a deserted island. ""We need help. We are independent businesses but slowly and surely we are fading away."" He said tier two restrictions were ""bad enough"" and his weekly takings had plummeted from Â£35,000 to Â£11,500 and he was struggling to pay the bills.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Wales will go into a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown from Friday until 9 November. People will be told to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops must shut. Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under new ""firebreak"" rules. Gatherings indoors and outdoors with people not in your household will also be banned. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the ""time-limited firebreak"" would be ""a short, sharp, shock to turn back the clock, slow down the virus and buy us more time"". Without action the NHS would not be able to cope, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But a UK government schemethat will cover 67% of the wages of workers at firms forced to close, due to start on 1 November, will not be brought forward to cover the Welsh lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that was because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"", in a letter to the first minister. Some employees may be able to be re-furloughed, however. Under the lockdown leisure businesses, community centres, libraries and recycling centres will shut. Places of worship will be closed for normal services, except for funerals and weddings. The announcement follows rising case numbers in Wales and increasing hospital admissions and replaces the 17 local lockdowns that had been in place. Figures now stand at 128.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over seven days - there were 4,043 cases recorded between 10 and 16 October. Also of concern is the proportion of positive tests - just under 12% in Wales and nearly 19% in Cardiff, which also has the highest case rate over the past week, 226.6 cases per 100,000. What difference could a circuit-breaker make? Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Welsh pro sport to continue in 'firebreak' Halloween and Bonfire Night gatherings will not be allowed under the restrictions which begin at 18:00 BST on Friday, the start of the half-term holiday. But there will be an exception for small Remembrance Sunday commemoration services on 8 November. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Non-essential cross border travel in and out of Wales ""will have to end"" during the firebreak period, Mr Drakeford said. Universities in Wales will continue to provide ""a blend of in-person and online learning"". If students have reading weeks or half-term they will also need to stay at home in their university accommodation, the first minister said. The Welsh Government has provided a package of almost Â£300m to support businesses. Non-essential retail will be told to close for 17 days from Friday The rules will be similar to the lockdown in March: People will have to stay at home except for very limited reasons, such as exercise People must work from home where they can People must not visit other households or meet other people they do not live with either indoors and outdoors All non-food retail will shut, and cafes, restaurants and pubs will close unless they provide delivery or takeaways Hotels, hairdressers and beauticians will have to shut People breaching the rules could be fined, with fixed penalty notices starting at Â£60. Adults living alone or single parents will be able to join with one other household from anywhere in Wales for support. Existing rules on face masks - requiring them to be worn in public places indoors - will stay in place. The previous lockdown continued for months past its initial three weeks, but Mr Drakeford said the firebreak would end on 9 November. ""I've heard some people say, 'oh, the figures won't be down by the 9 of November, so the period will have to continue' - that is not the test to set,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said a national lockdown was needed ""partly because the gap between those parts of Wales where we have not needed local lockdowns, and local lockdown areas have been narrowing"". ""We all want to see an end to this pandemic and our lives returned to us. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a vaccine, which will allow us to do that. ""So this is our best chance of regaining control of the virus and avoiding a much-longer - and damaging - national lockdown."" The two weeks will be used ""very purposefully"", the first minister said, allowing for more staff to be recruited for contact tracing and allow others to ""catch up on the huge volume of contacts that have to be contacted and traced"" from recent weeks. He told BBC Wales the speed of the upsurge in cases had ""come earlier than the models suggested"". Local restrictions had worked, he said, but added: ""We have to go beyond them, not because they have failed, but because they haven't been able to succeed enough. TheTechnical Advisory Cell,external, which gives advice to the Welsh Government, recommended a two or three week ""hard firebreak"" to bring thereproduction numberbelow 1. The R number is the rate at which the virus is increasing - it currently stands between 1.1 and 1.4. Without a massive reduction in transmission, the scientific advisory body concludes the impact on the hospitals and intensive care units would be ""too high for the NHS to sustain"". Pubs and restaurants will have to shut, unless they offer takeaways A new Â£300m fund for firms affected will open next week. The Welsh Government said every firm covered by small business rates relief would receive a Â£1,000 payment. Small and medium-sized retail, leisure and hospitality firms that have to close will get a one-off payment of up to Â£5,000. There will be additional discretionary grants and support for smaller firms that are struggling, the government said. It added that firms would be able to access the support available under the new UK government Job Support Scheme,which will cover 67% of workers pay at businesses forced to shut, but that does not begin until 1 November. Mr Sunak, in a letter to Mr Drakeford, said he would be unable to bring the claims date forward for the JSS to 23 October. He said the previous Job Retention Scheme was in place until 31 October and employees previously furloughed for three weeks can be re-furloughed. Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said people would lose their jobs ""as a result of the first minister's decision"" and claimed there had been a discussion with the Treasury ""a while ago"". He added: ""Asking the Treasury to suddenly bring forward the scheme, the first minister knows full well that wasn't possible - because he was told by the chancellor several days ago. ""That strikes me as being very, very unfair on the people who will be caught by the time gap between the Welsh Government scheme and the Treasury scheme kicking in."" The Welsh Government said ministers had offered to pay the extra costs associated with early access to the Jobs Support Scheme. A spokesman said it meant firms would ""now have to access both the Job Retention Scheme and the Job Support Scheme at different points during the fire-break period"". ""It is absolutely crucial the UK government ensures this process is as smooth as possible and that all affected Welsh businesses and employees benefit from these schemes during this difficult time."" The union Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru said the Welsh Government's decision that primary school children and secondary school children in Years 7and 8 should return after half-term was ""a sensible balance in these circumstances"". A retail lobbyist said she was not aware of ""any evidence"" that justified the closure of non-essential shops. ""Retailers are now gearing up for the vital festive trading period when a fifth of goods are bought. If shops can't trade in the run-up to Christmas that will be a catastrophe,"" said Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium. This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Janine Brown, who owns of Crundles gift shop in Swansea, said: ""I'm obviously disappointedâ¦ I've just ordered all my Christmas stock in and I've got to pay for it this week and we're going to be shut down for another two weeks. ""We're all fed up of it, we're all really upset about it. What do we do as small businesses?"" The British Beer and Pub Association said the firebreak would ""destroy many pubs, brewers and their supply chains in the country unless the financial support package is available to all businesses hit by the forced closure of all pubs"". ""The financial support package announced today leaves many businesses impacted by this forced closure with no additional help,"" said chief executive Emma McClarkin. In August, the Welsh Government launched its 'Coronavirus Control Plan for Wales' outlining a strategy to ""avoid returning to a national lockdown"". So, two months later, as we prepare for another lockdown, has that plan and those lines of defence failed? The first minister talked in his press conference about using the two week firebreak ""very purposefully"" to strengthen the contact tracing system and accelerating the establishment of field hospitals. He also said they will be looking at the system of fines. Could we see people receiving fixed penalty notices for not self-isolating? There was no direct answer today. The speed at which tests are being processed is still a major issue. But most of Wales' tests and most of the problems are in the UK government's lighthouse labs so out of their control. But Mr Drakeford said it is ""quite likely"" that one crucial aspect is unlikely to have improved by the end of the firebreak period - the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a firebreak was a ""last resort"" and should only be used in an emergency. ""We are now in an emergency,"" he said. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative leader, accused the first minister of ""failing to be open and transparent about the evidence"". He added: ""The main concern is that this national lockdown is not proportionate.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM wants to avoid Manchester lockdown situation Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she will have the final say on local Covid-19 restrictions in different parts of Scotland, saying ""the buck stops here"". The Scottish first minister said she would not ""offload"" decisions about local alert levels onto councils. A lengthy row has played out between UK ministers and leaders in Manchester over imposing stricter rules there. Ms Sturgeon said it was her ""driving ambition"" not to repeat this when a new multi-tier system begins in Scotland. She said the government would ""consult and be as collaborative as possible"", but would ultimately make the decisions and would not be getting into ""standoffs"". Tier 3 rules to be imposed on Greater Manchester Some 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester were left in limbo for more than a week during talks between ministers, mayors and MPs over whether the region would move into the top tier of England's Covid alert system. The talks broke down after 10 days amid disagreements over financial support, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now confirmed the region will be placed in the ""very high"" alert level from Friday even without a deal. Scotland is due to implement its own multi-tier system of restrictions after a set of short-term measures expires later in October. Ms Sturgeon said she made no criticism of anyone involved in the ""tough decisions"" in Manchester, but said she would be aiming to avoid such a dispute. The UK government has been in a standoff with local leaders in Greater Manchester over Covid-19 restrictions The first minister said: ""I believe it's really important that the buck for these difficult decisions stops here, with me and government. ""We are asking people to do extraordinary things right now, and it's not fair for me and the government to try to offload those onto other people, be it local authorities or health boards. ""We have to consult and be as collaborative as possible - we will absolutely be engaging with local authorities. And as we take decisions about which levels apply in which parts of the country we will want that to be collaborative. ""But ultimately we have to be able to take the decisions."" Ms Sturgeon said her government was ""not in a position to get into standoffs over money"", stressing the ""finite resources"" available to her. She said: ""What we are trying to do is give as much clarity and certainty as we can, have as much collaboration and discussion with those that need to be involved in these decisions as we can, not shy away from responsibility and ultimately me bearing the accountability for these decisions, and retaining a degree of flexibility in the face of an infectious virus. ""That is the balance we are trying to strike."" Pubs in Scotland's central belt have been shut down by the current set of short-term restrictions At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon also hinted thatthe current short-term restrictionson bars and restaurants - which are chiefly focused on the central belt - could be extended for another week until the multi-tier system has been signed off by MSPs. Rules clamping down on the hospitality trade are due to expire on 26 October, but MSPs will not vote on the government's ""strategic framework"" before then as Holyrood is in recess. The first minister is to discuss the restrictions with her cabinet on Wednesday. Asked if the current measures would be extended to cover the gap, she said: ""If you look at the numbers across the central belt right now and the sequencing over the next week of moving to a new system, you might expect it might make sense from a public health point of view to see that rolled over. ""That is one option cabinet is looking at tomorrow. ""The regulations currently expire on Monday, so another option would be for that to be allowed to happen - we will look at the data and I will give the outcome of that tomorrow."" Ms Sturgeon is to hold talks with opposition party leaders about the next steps on Tuesday afternoon, including Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. The Tory MP said he would ""look at everything as constructively as possible"", but said there had been a ""lack of clear guidance"" from the Scottish government to firms. He said: ""When they were given just 50 hours' notice to introduce these further restrictions, what was the guidance from the Scottish government to businesses about how they could change and adapt to make sure they could open again safely? ""It seems nothing has happened, nothing has been developed in that area and businesses are once again hearing through the daily briefing that these restrictions may last far longer.""

"The killing of Jamal Khashoggi sparked global outrage The fiancee of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia's crown prince, accusing him of ordering the killing. Hatice Cengiz and the rights group Khashoggi formed before his death are pursuing Mohammed bin Salman and more than 20 others for unspecified damages. Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents during a visit to the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018. The crown prince has denied ordering the killing. Khashoggi was a prominent critic of the Saudi government and had been living in self-imposed exile in the US, frequently writing for the Washington Post. In the civil lawsuit filed in Washington DC on Tuesday, Turkish citizen Ms Cengiz claims personal injury and financial losses over Khashoggi's death. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The journalist who vanished into a consulate Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Khashoggi's human rights group, Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn), says its operations were hampered. The lawsuit alleges that Khashoggi was murdered ""pursuant to a directive of defendant Mohammed bin Salman"". ""The objective of the murder was clear - to halt Mr Khashoggi's advocacy in the United States... for democratic reform in the Arab world,"" the lawsuit says. In a video conference on Tuesday, lawyers for Ms Cengiz and Dawn said the focus of the lawsuit was to have a US court hold the crown prince liable for the killing and to obtain documents that reveal the truth, the Washington Post newspaper reports. ""Jamal believed anything was possible in America and I place my trust in the American civil justice system to obtain a measure of justice and accountability,"" Ms Cengiz said in a statement. A prominent Saudi journalist, Khashoggi covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations. For decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. In his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on 2 October 2018 to obtain papers he needed in order to marry Ms Cengiz. After listening to purported audio recordings of conversations inside the consulate made by Turkish intelligence, UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard concluded that Khashoggi was ""brutally slain"" that day. The Saudi public prosecution concluded that the murder was not premeditated. It said the killing was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". This video can not be played British barrister Helena Kennedy and UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard describe the Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes The journalist was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, according to the Saudi prosecution. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate. The remains were never found. Turkish prosecutors concluded that Khashoggi was suffocated almost as soon as he entered the consulate, and that his body was destroyed. In December 2019, the Riyadh Criminal Court sentenced five people to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"". Three people were found not guilty, including Saudi Arabia's former deputy intelligence chief, Ahmad Asiri. Saud al-Qahtani, a former senior adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed, was investigated by the Saudi public prosecution but not charged. Last month, state media reported thatthe five death sentences were commuted to 20-year jail terms. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?

"This video can not be played Residents gathered at Chinnor Community Church on Monday to remember the Powell family A man who survived a crash which killed his wife and three of their children says he feels an ""abundance of loss"". Josh Powell's wife Zoe, 29, died with Phoebe, eight, when their people carrier collided with a lorry in Oxfordshire. Simeon, six, and four-year old Amelia, died at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, where their father and 18-month-old sister Penny remain. In a tribute to his family, Mr Powell said he faced an ""uncertain future"". Thecrash happened on the A40, near a railway bridge between Oxford and Cassington, on 12 October. Zoe Powell and her three eldest children died in the crash Mr Powell, from Chinnor, said: ""As I look to an uncertain future, I reflect on the fun that we had as a family, with feelings of sadness that it was cut so short. ""Before the adventure of starting a family nobody truly knows what to expect. ""All of life's preconceptions and what we see in the world around us meant that life as a family man was so much better than I expected it to be. ""I had been blessed with four wonderful children, whose thirst for life and hunger of adventure kept me busy but in the best possible way."" The 30-year-old described Phoebe as the ""model of her mother but with a thirst to always know more"" and that she was ""clever and able to make great jumps of imagination - her great creations in Lego are testament to this"". He said Simeon ""was just like his father, with a mischievous sense of humour [and] a keen sportsman"" who had been shortly due to play his first football match. Amelia was ""kind and spirited"", he said, with a ""tenderness and thoughtfulness much more advanced than her years"". He added: ""Myself and Zoe were as different as we were alike. Despite the frequent tensions this would bring, it was of immense benefit having such differing world views. ""Zoe was a dreamer; with a head spinning of new things to do or tales to tell. More than anything, we made a great partnership to raise a family."" Mrs Powell, who had lived in Chinnor since the mid-2010s but was previously from Sheffield, was a blogger who wrote about motherhood, family life and the challenges of having young children. The crash happened on the A40, between Oxford and Cassington The deaths came just months after the family lost everything in a blaze at their home. Mr Powell thanked well-wishers for the support now that he had lost his ""immediate nuclear family"" and said there were ""many battles to come"". Acandlelit vigil was held in their home village on Monday eveningfor the family. The 1st Chinnor Scout Troop, where Mr Powell is a leader, marched to the private vigil, while residents in the cul-de-sac where the family lived illuminated their houses with green lights to show support. Josh Powell says he faces an ""uncertain future"" following the loss of his wife and three older children A JustGiving page set up by a railway worker colleague of Mr Powellhas raised more than Â£120,000.

"This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Employees could face redundancy if the Treasury does not change its support for workers during Wales' firebreak lockdown, Wales' first minister has said. Furlough ends on 31 October, and a new scheme starts on 1 November, a week after the start of the firebreak. Mark Drakeford said he was concerned many laid off staff would not be eligible for what remains of furlough. The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had earlier accused the first minister of taking a decision that would mean people would lose jobs. On Monday, Mr Hart said the Welsh Government knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury to bring forward the Job Support Scheme before announcing the firebreak lockdown in Wales. He said the lockdown announcement in Wales was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"" before the Treasury scheme begins on 1 November. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Under the firebreak non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants will be forced to close from 18:00 BST on Friday to 9 November. On Monday Chancellor Rishi Sunak declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages - to be brought forward a month. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) expressed concerns about the impact on companies caused by the gap between the start of JSS, and the start of lockdown. The Welsh Government says the lockdown was necessary to avoid overwhelming the NHS. In a new letter to the Chancellor, Mr Drakeford said he was ""very concerned... that in the worst-affected sectors, leisure and hospitality, it is likely that many staff who will be laid off as a result of the necessary decision to close down all non-essential businesses from 23 October will not fulfil the eligibility criteria to be enrolled on the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) for its last week of operation. ""Employers with no income will be faced with the difficult decision of paying all of the wage costs of these employees or making them redundant."" The first minister has called for a relaxation in the old furlough scheme, which ends on 31 October, so it can cover all those paying tax through PAYE registered on or before 23 September. Currently only employees who were furloughed for three consecutive weeks can get help from the Treasury for the first week of the firebreak. The JSS plans to cover 67% of workers' wages in businesses that have been forced to close. It pays up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month and staff must be off for seven days to be eligible. Payments are due to begin in December. It replaces furlough, which ends on 31 October and covered 80% of pay, with government paying 60% and employers 20%. Some employees who are entitled to help through JSS may not be able to get help from furlough for the first week of lockdown - but it is not clear how many. Neither the Welsh Government or the HMRC were able to provide figures for how many people would be impacted. This lockdown means 20,000 pumpkin stock could be lost, says farm manager Damien Burnell The firebreak rules could mean losing 20,000 pumpkins - which is Â£80,000 revenue - for farm manager Damien Burnell at Penllyn Estate Farm in Cowbridge. ""We have got over 80,000 square metres of open space here and we can do this safely,"" he said. ""It is really going to impact our business quite hard."" Meanwhile the owner of Seven Clothing in Roath, Cardiff, Jaymin Patel, said he believed they too could operate safely. ""We have just all been pigeon-holed into one category and all just told to close,"" he said. Mr Patel added it is ""really difficult"" finding out about eligible support whilst running his business. This video can not be played Back in June there were fears for the future of the pub industry which were closed for months Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes have only beenallowed to serve customers indoors since restrictions were lifted on 3 August. Alistair Darby, CEO of brewery and pub chain Brains, which employs 1,400 people in Wales, said the pumps were being switched off again. Mr Darby told BBC Radio Wales more clarity was needed from the Welsh Government to stop businesses from trying to plug a wage gap, at a time no money was coming in. ""We have got to work out how to communicate to our staff what's going to happen to them, and what support they are going to get in three days,"" he said. ""It's an absolute dog's dinner. ""We've done everything that was asked of us to support the government in the fight of coronavirus... if they are going to shut us down again they need to do their bit and fast."" Boss Brewing owner Sarah John is worried there will be more firebreak lockdowns to come Sarah John, who owns of Boss Brewing in Swansea, said the firebreak would have an impact on their supply to pubs across Wales. But her worry was that the firebreak duration, ending on 9 November, would not be enough. ""My concern is what then? What if it doesn't have the desired affect? How many times can we continue to go back into lockdown?"" she said. Landlady Sarah Hudson says she feels ""alone"" after having to shut again weeks after reopening following flood damage The Bell at Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, was badly damaged after being flooded twice during storms in October and February. After being unable to get builders on site during the pandemic, the hotel only reopened on 4 September, and is now having to close again. Landlady Sarah Hudson said: ""We've only been open weeks, it's devastating. ""We were fully booked, we've had to cancel guests again... it's really upsetting, it really doesn't do much for our reputation as either flooded or shut down."" Ms Hudson said she was determined for the business to survive, but did not want to have to take out any more loans: ""I feel very much on my own."" Non-essential shops will have to close, as well as venues, gyms and beauty salons Ben Cottam of FSB Wales said issues with the Job Support Scheme was just one of the ways ""the firebreak lockdown will be causing serious disruption to businesses"". He said businesses that had not previously furloughed staff could not take advantage of wage support until 1 November, and there was an administrative issue in accessing two different schemes. ""We need UK government to take steps to make this process as straightforward as it possibly can be,"" he said. ""Thirdly, the amount of confusion surrounding this issue illustrates just how complex the situation looks to a small employer. There is no hard and fast word from UK and Welsh governments combined on this, and if you're a small employer trying to understand this situation, this will only cause more misunderstanding."" He said firms still needed clear guidance on who is required to close, and what is required of those firms that are still allowed to trade in some capacity. CBI Wales director Ian Price said: ""It appears that some people may unfortunately being falling through the cracks of the JRS and JSS. ""It's imperative for business, government and employees that we make this work."" Gyms will have to close again, only months after they reopened for members The Treasury has denied there is a gap between the two schemes. A spokesman said: ""We've given the Welsh Government an additional Â£4.4bn to cope with the pressures of the pandemic and we have protected more than half a million jobs in Wales through our income support schemes. ""Our support will continue over the winter months, with employers able to use the furlough scheme until the end of October and the Job Support Scheme from November 1."" Economy Minister Ken Skates told a press conference that while there may be no time gap between JRS and JSS, he claimed ""in terms of the generosity of his two schemes there is most certainly a gap"". He added that the Welsh Government was unable to make direct payments to workers itself to make up the gap, because it did not have access to people's tax records. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""question of fairness"". Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said: ""A firebreak gives us the opportunity to buy more time to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system. ""But for that to work, the UK government must also do its part by giving appropriate financial support."" A UK government source said the chancellor called all finance ministers before the announcement of the expansion of the scheme to explain how it would work, when it would come into effect and that it would be UK-wide. He asked finance ministers to keep restrictions as consistent as possible across the devolved nations, the source said. The Welsh Government said an extra Â£150m was being added to the Â£140m Economic Resilience Fund to support firms through the firebreak. It will include: Payments of Â£1,000 for businesses that are eligible for Small Business Rates relief and occupy a property with a rateable value of Â£12,000 or less Payments of up to Â£5,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that are required to close and which occupy a property with a rateable value of between Â£12,001 and Â£50,000 A Â£2,000 ""top-up grant"" for businesses closed or materially affected by lockdown A Â£1,000 grant for businesses that were materially affected by local lockdown measures for 21 days or more prior to the start of the firebreak Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown?

"Google has been issued with huge fines in the EU over market dominance The US government has filed charges against Google, accusing the company of violating competition law to preserve its monopoly over internet searches and online advertising. The lawsuit marks the biggest challenge brought by US regulators against a major tech company in years. It follows more than a year of investigation and comes as the biggest tech firms face intense scrutiny of their practices at home and abroad. Google called the case ""deeply flawed"". The company has maintained that its sector remains intensely competitive and that its practices put customers first. ""People use Google because they choose to - not because they're forced to or because they can't find alternatives,"" it said. The charges, filed in federal court, were brought by the US Department of Justice and 11 other states. The lawsuit focuses on the billions of dollars Google pays each year to ensure its search engine is installed as the default option on browsers and devices such as mobile phones. Officials said those deals have helped secure Google's place as the ""gatekeeper"" to the internet, allowing it to own or control the distribution channels for about 80% of search queries in the US. Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai at a 2018 hearing in Washington. In July, he assured Congress, ""We conduct ourselves to the highest standard"". ""Google has thus foreclosed competition for internet search,"" the lawsuit said. ""General search engine competitors are denied vital distribution, scale, and product recognition - ensuring they have no real chance to challenge Google."" It added: ""Google is so dominant that 'Google' is not only a noun to identify the company and the Google search engine but also a verb that means to search the internet."" The suit said the deals have hurt the public by damaging search quality in terms of privacy and data protection, reducing choice and thwarting innovation. Sally Hubbard, who works for the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that has long pushed for more aggressive action against big tech firms, said focusing on Google's search distribution deals was one of the easiest legal cases to make against the company. On Twitter she said the lawsuit had ""been so long coming but it's wonderful to see"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The case could be the first of many in the US that challenge the dominance of big tech firms and potentially lead to their break-up. Other states have launched their own investigations, and said they may join the suit filed on Tuesday or file their own. Politicians in Congress have also called for action against Google and fellow tech firms Amazon, Facebook and Apple in an effort that has united Democrats and Republicans. US tech giants accused of 'monopoly power' After the questions: What next for Big Tech? The decision to file the lawsuit just a few weeks before the US presidential election has raised questions about whether it was simply a move by the Trump administration to prove its willingness to challenge the influence of the sector if it gains a second term. But officials said they had not rushed the investigation to ensure it was filed before the election - noting that for years, many advocates have said the government was moving too slowly on such issues. ""We're acting when the facts and the law warranted,"" deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen said,adding that the department's review of competition practices in the technology sector is continuing. Google has faced similar claims in the European Union. Itis already appealing against â¬8.2bn ($9.5bn; Â£7.3bn) in fines demanded by the European Commissionwhich include: in 2017,a â¬2.4bn fine over shopping results in 2018,a â¬4.3bn fine over claims it used Android software to unfairly promote its own apps in 2019,a â¬1.5bn fine for blocking adverts from rival search engines. Google parent Alphabet, which has a market value of more than $1tn, is expected to fight the allegations in the US as well. Its share price was little changed on Tuesday, despite the news. Taking on a giant like Google will be one of biggest competition cases in decades. But the case - to decide if the California-based company abuses its market power - could last years. European regulators have led the way in taking action against the tech giants. But this move by the US Department of Justice is a sign that the mood has turned against them at home too. The complaint says that two decades ago Google was a scrappy innovative start-up - but now it's the monopoly gatekeeper to the internet. Google stands accused of using anti-competitive tactics to shut out rivals and extend that monopoly. Google says people use it because they choose to rather than being forced.

"Greater Manchester to move to tier 3 - very high- alert level from 00:01 on Friday Measures imposed by government after collapse of talks to agree deal with local leaders Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls move ""brutal"" and asks Parliament to intervene Region to get Â£22m for testing and tracing but no funding agreed for business support But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says an offer of Â£60m is ""still on the table"" Number of UK deaths with Covid on the certificate up 38% in a week, ONS figures show Republic of Ireland moving to a new, very high, level of coronavirus restrictions France has reported more than 2,000 people in intensive care - the first time since May Edited by Martha Buckley We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Today's reporting of the pandemic was brought to you by: Francesca Gillett, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Marie Jackson, Emma Owen, Martha Buckley, John Hand, Paul Seddon and Mal Siret. Thanks for reading. The Duchess of Cambridge has officially launched her Hold Still photo exhibition, comprised of 100 images taken in lockdown. She and the Duke of Cambridge met specialist oncology pharmacist Joyce Duah, whose photo of her colleagues writing their names and smiley faces on their PPE aprons was one of those selected. Catherine told Joyce: ""It had such an impact - it captured the moment, it was a look behind the scenes."" The royal pair also travelled to Waterloo, south London, to view one of the 80 public exhibition sites across the country being used for the project over the next four weeks. All 100 portraits will feature in a special exhibition hosted by the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire from Friday. Apart from the drama surrounding the tier-three restrictions for Greater Manchester, here's what you might have missed if you're just catching up. Liverpool City Region was the first area of England to enter tier 3. Labour says it will force a Commons vote tomorrow on a ""one nation"" approach to support for regions facing additional restrictions. They have put down a motion calling on ministers to publish ""clear and fair"" national criteria for economic support. The motion adds that financial help should also be voted on by MPs. The vote is non-binding but is an attempt to put pressure on the government over the issue of how support is determined. Here's a reminder of the main developments surrounding Greater Manchester's Covid-19 restrictions: Melania Trump will not be joining the US president at a campaign rally later today ""out of an abundance of caution"" As a bitter row erupts in England over strict restrictions being imposed in Manchester, here is a round-up of some of the other key headlines from around the world: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North""? (As some now call him). All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Council leaders in West Yorkshire have issued a statement saying the region will remain in tier two for the moment. In a statement, they said national and local public health experts agreed there was ""not a case"" to move the region to tier three this week. The leaders however repeated their call foradditional support,externalfor the area to help it through the tier two restrictions. Andy Preston, independent mayor of Middlesbrough, speaking on  BBC Radio 4 earlier today said that the city risked being put into tier three on the basis of flawed data. He said: âThey donât have the local knowledge that we have so Iâm terrified to know that conversations are going [on] in No 10 about putting Middlesbrough into tier three with bad data and based inferences and still no conversations, so Iâm wholly dispirited.â He added: âWe need a lot of money. We are facing monstrous problems here and the government seems oblivious,"" he said. ""I need to be talking to ministers and explaining the number of free school meals kids here is ballooning and the job losses are just starting. ""Weâre hitting a catastrophe of poverty and deprivation and we need serious money and serious commitment from the government to deal with it.â Labour's shadow chancellor Jonathan Ashworth said people across Greater Manchester ""will be watching the news in disbelief"". He says they will be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" ""How does he
expect families to the pay the bills, to pay the rent, to put food on the table
and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region. Earlier, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young asked the prime minister how much money would be made available. This video can not be played Covid-19: PM says 'huge sums' are being invested to help local authorities House of CommonsParliament Matt Hancock tells MPs placing Greater Manchester into tier three was a ""difficult decision"" but needed because of the spread of the virus. The health secretary says a ""comprehensive package of support"" will help the region weather the ""tough"" restrictions. He says Greater Manchester will get Â£22m for contact tracing and testing but a deal for business support has not been done. He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions. ""It's difficult to call when that might be. We're currently in the high risk category, we may move to the very high-risk category,"" Mr Fell said. Earlier the government released today's figures showing the number of new cases and deaths,which you can read more about here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update the House of Commons on England's latest Covid restrictions shortly. MPs are sure to ask him about support for Greater Manchester, after the PM announced the region isset to enter tier 3. The company suggested that the expected fall in the global birth rate following lockdown could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year Sales of Durex condoms jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm of the business, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. During the first UK lockdown, people who did not live in same household were not allowed to meet.

Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row. Interviewed by a California radio station, he said: ""That other stuff, it's like in 'The Godfather': Nothing
personal, strictly business. As far as I'm concerned, I just
want to do my job and take care of the people of this country."" There are more than 8.2 million confirmed cases in the US, and more than 220,000 people have died with coronavirus.      Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.951159
"Kanad Basi had drunk alcohol and taken cocaine and ecstasy before the crash A drink and drugs driver who killed a teenager in a crash has been jailed for four years and eight months. Kanad Basi, 22, was almost twice the drink-drive limit having also taken cocaine and ecstasy when he lost control of his BMW and hit a tree. His front-seat passenger, 16-year-old Jack Frame, died at the scene in Lesmahagow, South Lanarkshire. At the High Court in Glasgow, Basi pled guilty to causing his death by driving dangerously on 10 February 2019. Following the sentence, Jack's family released a statement saying they felt ""angry and devastated at the outcome"". Front-seat passenger Jack Frame died at the scene of the crash in February 2019 They added: ""Only getting four years eight months in jail will not deter anyone from doing the same thing. ""This has not given us any type of justice after what has a been a long process for us."" The crash happened after Basi, a waiter in the family business, took three teenagers for a drive. He drove into a bend at speed on New Trows Road, Lesmahagow, before crashing into a tree. Boy killed by drunk driver who had taken drugs Rear passengers Aiden O'Donnell and Eleanor Plenderleith suffered severe injuries in the crash. Following the crash, Basi climbed into the rear seat and pushed Ms Plenderleith into the front. However, his DNA and blood were found on the driver's airbag. Jack Frame's family added: ""Kanad tried to blame Ellie which was incredibly unfair and this accident resulted in Jack's death and serious injury to both Aiden and Ellie."" Judge Lord Mulholland told Basi he would "" have to live with what you have done for the rest of your life"". He added: ""You have delivered a life sentence to Jack Frame's family by your dangerous driving. ""They have shown dignity and human spirit in the face of the misery that you have inflicted upon them."" Basi will also be banned from the road for 12 years and four months. The court had heard how Basi had driven to a party in Lesmahagow in his BMW 1 series two-door coupe at about 01:00. A number of the partygoers asked to go for a drive in it and three of them drove off with him at 02:00. Prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: ""As the accused approached a right-hand bend, he lost control of the car. His vehicle left the carriageway, mounted the grass verge, collided with a wire fence and struck a tree in the grounds of Hallandbush Golf Club. ""Due to this impact, Jack Frame was thrown forward and trapped within the front passenger side of the vehicle. His head was wedged underneath the glove box area."" Mr O'Donnell, an apprentice joiner who was 18 at the time, was sitting behind Basi. He suffered a fractured skull, four facial fractures, two broken legs and a number of fractures to his left arm. The court was told he had to learn to walk again and has been unable to work since the accident. Ms Plenderleith, who at the time was 19 and worked at Subway, was knocked unconscious. She had a punctured lung, lacerated liver, broken ribs and a fractured chest bone. A metal plate had to be inserted into her left upper arm. None of the passengers was wearing a seat belt.

"This video can not be played From February 2019: Is a European Super League the future of football? Talks have taken place over the creation of a new Â£4.6bn European Premier League, involving the top sides from across the continent. Sources told the BBC that discussions are still at an early stage but the plan would involve replacing the Champions League with a new format. Industry insiders confirmed talks involved Wall Street bank JP Morgan. But the project is said to still have a ""long way to go"" and the deal ""may not happen"". Reports suggest,externalfive Premier League clubs, including champions Liverpool and Manchester United, have been approached by those behind the plan with more than a dozen teams from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in negotiations about becoming founder members of the competition. It has also been reported that the European Premier League would see 18 sides compete in a single league with the top sides taking part in a play-off to determine an overall winner and that world governing body Fifa is involved. Last week Premier League clubsrejected 'Project Big Picture'- a proposal to reduce the league from 20 to 18 clubs and scrap the EFL Cup and Community Shield. It would also have seen more power transferred to the so-called 'big six' Premier League clubs. European football's governing body Uefa said it opposed the plan. ""The Uefa president has made it clear on many occasions that Uefa strongly opposes a Super League. ""The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable.  It is what makes European football work and the Champions League the best sports competition in the world. ""Uefa and the clubs are committed to build on such strength not to destroy it to create a super league of 10, 12, even 24 clubs, which would inevitably become boring."" Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, said the idea of a European Super League shows that billionaire owners of clubs ""are out of control"". ""The latest reports of plots, allegedly involving Manchester United and Liverpool, to create a European Super League, expose the myth that billionaire owners care about the English football pyramid, or indeed anything other than their own greed,"" said Miles. ""This has to be the last nail in the coffin of the idea that football can be relied upon to regulate itself."" La Liga president Javier Tebas said: ""The authors of that idea - if they really exist, because there is nobody actually defending it - not only show a total ignorance of the organisation and customs of European and world football, but also a serious ignorance of the audiovisual rights markets. ""A project of this type will mean serious economic damage to the organisers themselves and to those entities that finance it, if they exist, because theyÂ´re never official.

"More than 100,000 women have had their clothes digitally removed from images Faked nude images of more than 100,000 women have been created from social media pictures and shared online, according to a new report. Clothes are digitally removed from pictures of women by Artificial Intelligence (AI), and spread on the messaging app Telegram. Some of those targeted ""appeared to be underage"", the report by intelligence company Sensity said. But those running the service said it was simply ""entertainment"". The BBC has tested the software and received poor results. Sensity claim the technology used is a ""deepfake bot"". Deepfakes are computer-generated, often realistic images and video, based on a real template. One of its uses has been to create faked pornographic video clips of celebrities. But Sensity's chief executive Giorgio Patrini said the shift to using photos of private individuals is relatively new. ""Having a social media account with public photos is enough for anyone to become a target,"" he warned. The artificial intelligence-powered bot lives inside a Telegram private messaging channel. Users can send the bot a photo of a woman, and it will digitally remove her clothes in minutes, at no cost. The BBC tested multiple images, all with the subjects' consent, and none were completely realistic - our results included a photo of a woman with a belly button on her diaphragm. A similar app was shut down last year, but it is believed there are cracked versions of the software in circulation. The administrator running the service, known only as ""P"" said: ""I don't care that much. This is entertainment that does not carry violence. ""No one will blackmail anyone with this, since the quality is unrealistic."" He also said the team looks at what photos are shared, and ""when we see minors we block the user for good."" Illustrations from the report show how messaging the bot will result in a modified version being sent back But the decision on whether to share the photo with others is up to whoever used the bot to create it in the first place, he said. Defending its relative level of harm, he added: ""There are wars, diseases, many bad things that are harmful in the world."" He has also claimed he will soon remove all of the images. Telegram has not responded to a request for comment. Sensity reported that between July 2019 and 2020, approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had fake naked images of them shared publicly. Its investigation found that some of the images appeared underage, ""suggesting that some users were primarily using the bot to generate and share paedophilic content."" Sensity said the bot has had significant advertising on the Russian social media site VK, and a survey on the platform showed that most users were from Russia and ex-USSR countries. But VK said: ""It doesn't tolerate such content or links on the platform and blocks communities that distribute them."" Telegram was officiallybanned in Russiauntil earlier this year. ""Many of these websites or apps do not hide or operate underground, because they are not strictly outlawed,"" said Sensity's Giorgio Patrini. ""Until that happens, I am afraid it will only get worse."" This video can not be played Actress Bella Thorne opens up about her experience of deepfake abuse The authors of the report say they have shared all their findings with Telegram, VK and relevant law enforcement agencies, but have not had a response. Nina Schick, author of the book Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse, said deepfake creators were all over the world, and that legal protections were ""playing catch-up"" with the technology. ""It's only a matter of time until that content becomes more sophisticated. The number of deepfake porn videos seems to be doubling every six months,"" she said. ""Our legal systems are not fit for purpose on this issue. Society is changing quicker than we can imagine due to these exponential technological advances, and we as a society haven't decided how to regulate this. ""It's devastating, for victims of fake porn. It can completely upend their life because they feel violated and humiliated."" Last year the US state of Virginia became one of the first places tooutlaw deepfakes The current UK law around fake nude images has recently been criticised for being ""inconsistent, out-of-date and confusing"" in auniversity report.,external Despite progress on issues like revenge porn and upskirting, ""there remain many glaring gaps in the law"", says Lucy Hadley of the Women's Aid charity. While these statistics show how widespread deep-fake images can be, it is not currently a specific offence. The government has instructed theLaw Commission to review,externalthe law around the issue in England and Wales. Its findings are due in 2021.

"Scientists around the globe are working on potential vaccines for coronavirus The UK is pushing ahead to be the first nation to carry out ""human challenge"" studies where up to 90 healthy people will be deliberately exposed to Covid. The trials, which could begin in January, aim to speed up the race to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The government is putting Â£33.6m towards the groundbreaking work. Safety will be a number one priority, experts insist. The plans will need ethical approval and sign-off from regulators before they can go ahead. Human challenge studies provide a faster way to test vaccines because you don't have to wait for people to be exposed to an illness naturally. Researchers would first use controlled doses of the pandemic virus to discover what is the smallest amount that can cause Covid infection in volunteers aged 18 to 30. These human guinea pigs, who will be infected with the virus through the nose and monitored around the clock, have the lowest risk of harm due to their young age and good health. Next, scientists could test if a Covid vaccine prevents infection. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? This video can not be played What are human challenge trials? Lead researcher for the project Dr Chris Chiu, from Imperial College London, said: ""My team has been safely running human challenge studies with other respiratory viruses for over 10 years. No study is completely risk free, but the Human Challenge Programme partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can."" Prof Peter Openshaw, co-investigator on the study and director of theHuman Challenge Consortium,external, said deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen was ""never undertaken lightly"". ""However, such studies are enormously informative. ""It is really vital that we move as fast as possible towards getting effective vaccines and other treatments for Covid-19."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? There are hundreds of Covid vaccines being developed around the world and several front-runners already in the final stages of testing, including one from Oxford University. While some of these could get results and start to be used before the new trial has chance to begin, researchers say the work will still be useful, particularly for head-to-head studies to compare which vaccines work best. Experts say we will probably need a few different vaccines, as well as effective treatments, to defeat Covid. They will also need to be tested in those at highest risk from Covid - the elderly and vulnerable. The first stage of the human challenge project will be delivered by a partnership between Imperial College London, the Royal Free Hospital's specialist and secure research unit in London and a company called hVIVO. After exposure to Covid, the young volunteers will need to stay in a biosecure facility until they are no longer infectious. They will be financially reimbursed for their time, and monitored for up to a year after taking part in the study to check for any side-effects. People can sign uphere,external. Purposely infecting someone with Covid does pose an ethical dilemma, especially since there is no treatment to cure patients, although there are ones that might make it less deadly. Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at Oxford University, said the trials were justified: ""In a pandemic, time is lives. So far, over a million people have died. ""There is a moral imperative to develop to a safe and effective vaccine - and to do so as quickly as possible. ""Given the stakes, it is unethical not to do challenge studies."" Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""We are doing everything we can to fight coronavirus, including backing our best and brightest scientists and researchers in their hunt for a safe and effective vaccine.""

"Greater Manchester is set to move to the top level of England Covid restrictions Businesses in Greater Manchester fear some may not survive as the area is moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions. It has followed Liverpool City Region and Lancashire intotier three. Businesses including pubs and bars, unless they serve substantial meals, as well as soft play facilities, betting shops and casinos will have to close on Friday just after midnight. The move has been met with anger, frustration and upset by businesses. Live reaction to the latest Covid measures What is the three-tier system? What Covid tier is my area in? The owner of a Menagerie Restaurant and Bar, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre, said consumer confidence had been knocked by the confusion over coronavirus restrictions. Karina Jadhav said she was allowed to stay open, but have to close anyway as people stay away ""We have been operating under restrictions, which are close to tier three for three months now,"" said Karina Jadhav. ""While we are allowed to stay open, the restrictions, the confusion and the communication coming from the government has really reduced consumer confidence. ""This has resulted - for us - in a lot of cancellations, people not booking, people wanting refunds. ""So while we are allowed to stay open, we are being restricted to the point where it is difficult to keep the business open in the current circumstances."" The managing director of Wythenshawe-based Whitehouse Event Crockery said the situation was ""heartbreaking"". Marc Gough said he had a viable business but had been forgotten by government The business, which supplies goods including plates and glassware for weddings and events, will not be forced to close down in tier three. However, the move to the toughest tier of measures would have a direct effect on the number of bookings, said Marc Gough. ""Weddings cannot take place in a tier three environment, so effectively they are stopping us from working with no financial support,"" he said. ""This is a viable business - a very successful, viable business - and we have just had no support from the government. ""We have been simply forgotten and it's heartbreaking."" Greater Manchester recorded almost 11,000 new cases in the week to 16 October, according to data updated on Monday. Latest figures show cases rose across most of Greater Manchester in the week to 16 October. However, the city of Manchester has so far seen a fall compared with the week before. Even so, it still has a high rate of new cases, with just under 404 per 100,000 people in the week to last Friday. Rochdale recorded Greater Manchester's highest rate with 462 cases per 100,000 residents. Stockport and Trafford have the lowest rates in Greater Manchester, with 266 per 100,000 and 310 per 100,000 respectively. The managing director of a bar in Burnage said it was going to be a ""tough winter"" as the hospitality industry adjusted to the new three-tier system. Elena Rowe, pictured right with her colleague Sean Gregson, said it had been a frustrating time for the business ""It's really sad. We have done everything we can to keep safe,"" said Elena Rowe, from Reasons to be Cheerful. Reasons to be Cheerful will be among the pubs to close under tier three. ""We have regulars and a lot of them drink on their own, and the space we provide is their bubble and it's sad that this is going to end for people. ""It's going to be a tough winter. I'm frustrated and upset,"" said Ms Rowe. The owner of a bar in the heart of Manchester's gay village said tier three would also force him to close. John Hamilton warned that businesses were fading away and he called for help John Hamilton, who runs Bar Pop and employees 60 members of staff, said: ""I am so upset. The city centre will be like a deserted island. ""We need help. We are independent businesses but slowly and surely we are fading away."" He said tier two restrictions were ""bad enough"" and his weekly takings had plummeted from Â£35,000 to Â£11,500 and he was struggling to pay the bills.

"Greater Manchester to move to tier 3 - very high- alert level from 00:01 on Friday Measures imposed by government after collapse of talks to agree deal with local leaders Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls move ""brutal"" and asks Parliament to intervene Region to get Â£22m for testing and tracing but no funding agreed for business support But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says an offer of Â£60m is ""still on the table"" Number of UK deaths with Covid on the certificate up 38% in a week, ONS figures show Republic of Ireland moving to a new, very high, level of coronavirus restrictions France has reported more than 2,000 people in intensive care - the first time since May Edited by Martha Buckley We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Today's reporting of the pandemic was brought to you by: Francesca Gillett, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Marie Jackson, Emma Owen, Martha Buckley, John Hand, Paul Seddon and Mal Siret. Thanks for reading. The Duchess of Cambridge has officially launched her Hold Still photo exhibition, comprised of 100 images taken in lockdown. She and the Duke of Cambridge met specialist oncology pharmacist Joyce Duah, whose photo of her colleagues writing their names and smiley faces on their PPE aprons was one of those selected. Catherine told Joyce: ""It had such an impact - it captured the moment, it was a look behind the scenes."" The royal pair also travelled to Waterloo, south London, to view one of the 80 public exhibition sites across the country being used for the project over the next four weeks. All 100 portraits will feature in a special exhibition hosted by the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire from Friday. Apart from the drama surrounding the tier-three restrictions for Greater Manchester, here's what you might have missed if you're just catching up. Liverpool City Region was the first area of England to enter tier 3. Labour says it will force a Commons vote tomorrow on a ""one nation"" approach to support for regions facing additional restrictions. They have put down a motion calling on ministers to publish ""clear and fair"" national criteria for economic support. The motion adds that financial help should also be voted on by MPs. The vote is non-binding but is an attempt to put pressure on the government over the issue of how support is determined. Here's a reminder of the main developments surrounding Greater Manchester's Covid-19 restrictions: Melania Trump will not be joining the US president at a campaign rally later today ""out of an abundance of caution"" As a bitter row erupts in England over strict restrictions being imposed in Manchester, here is a round-up of some of the other key headlines from around the world: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North""? (As some now call him). All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Council leaders in West Yorkshire have issued a statement saying the region will remain in tier two for the moment. In a statement, they said national and local public health experts agreed there was ""not a case"" to move the region to tier three this week. The leaders however repeated their call foradditional support,externalfor the area to help it through the tier two restrictions. Andy Preston, independent mayor of Middlesbrough, speaking on  BBC Radio 4 earlier today said that the city risked being put into tier three on the basis of flawed data. He said: âThey donât have the local knowledge that we have so Iâm terrified to know that conversations are going [on] in No 10 about putting Middlesbrough into tier three with bad data and based inferences and still no conversations, so Iâm wholly dispirited.â He added: âWe need a lot of money. We are facing monstrous problems here and the government seems oblivious,"" he said. ""I need to be talking to ministers and explaining the number of free school meals kids here is ballooning and the job losses are just starting. ""Weâre hitting a catastrophe of poverty and deprivation and we need serious money and serious commitment from the government to deal with it.â Labour's shadow chancellor Jonathan Ashworth said people across Greater Manchester ""will be watching the news in disbelief"". He says they will be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" ""How does he
expect families to the pay the bills, to pay the rent, to put food on the table
and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region. Earlier, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young asked the prime minister how much money would be made available.

The health secretary says a ""comprehensive package of support"" will help the region weather the ""tough"" restrictions. He says Greater Manchester will get Â£22m for contact tracing and testing but a deal for business support has not been done. He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions. ""It's difficult to call when that might be. We're currently in the high risk category, we may move to the very high-risk category,"" Mr Fell said. Earlier the government released today's figures showing the number of new cases and deaths,which you can read more about here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update the House of Commons on England's latest Covid restrictions shortly. MPs are sure to ask him about support for Greater Manchester, after the PM announced the region isset to enter tier 3. The company suggested that the expected fall in the global birth rate following lockdown could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year Sales of Durex condoms jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm of the business, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. During the first UK lockdown, people who did not live in same household were not allowed to meet.

Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row. Interviewed by a California radio station, he said: ""That other stuff, it's like in 'The Godfather': Nothing
personal, strictly business. As far as I'm concerned, I just
want to do my job and take care of the people of this country."" There are more than 8.2 million confirmed cases in the US, and more than 220,000 people have died with coronavirus.      Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' The failure to agree a Â£65m package of support will mean a ""winter of hardship"" for Greater Manchester if tier three measures are imposed, the region's mayor has said. Andy Burnham said tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"". He added ministers ""walked away"" from negotiations over aid earlier today. Tier three rules mean most pubs and bars will close, and there will be extra restrictions on household mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to hold a press conference at 17:00 BST, which will be followed by a statement in the House of Commons from Health Secretary Matt Hancock at 19:00. Speaking alongside other local leaders, Mr Burnham said: ""At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities."" The former MP added he was still willing to do a deal with the government ""but it cannot be on the terms the government has offered today"". What Covid tier is my area in? How do I get a coronavirus test? Latest reaction as Greater Manchester prepares to join Tier 3 But addressing the people of Greater Manchester, he added: ""Please, everybody, observe the law at all times and follow the public health advice. Above all else, please look out for each other, as I know you will."" The latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Burnham's comments follow 10 days of talks between the government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8 million population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""collapse of the talks"" was a ""sign of government failure"". Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, household mixing is banned both indoors and outdoors, and there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m of central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits - but in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood that Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more, proportionately, than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. After 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over down to a gap of Â£5m. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Burnham had been ""unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control"". He added: ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" Responding to the news, Sir Keir said: ""The Conservatives have been treating local communities, particularly in the Midlands, North West and North East, and their leaders with contempt. ""Labour recognise the need for stricter public health restrictions. However, that must be accompanied by extra financial support."" William Wragg, Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, tweeted that the ""sense of failure"" was ""overwhelming"". He added: ""I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in House of Commons this evening."" The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that discussions were planned about South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". This video can not be played What is the new three tier system after lockdown? Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told to stay at home from Friday, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. And in Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's.

He said: âThey donât have the local knowledge that we have so Iâm terrified to know that conversations are going [on] in No 10 about putting Middlesbrough into tier three with bad data and based inferences and still no conversations, so Iâm wholly dispirited.â He added: âWe need a lot of money. We are facing monstrous problems here and the government seems oblivious,"" he said. ""I need to be talking to ministers and explaining the number of free school meals kids here is ballooning and the job losses are just starting. ""Weâre hitting a catastrophe of poverty and deprivation and we need serious money and serious commitment from the government to deal with it.â Labour's shadow chancellor Jonathan Ashworth said people across Greater Manchester ""will be watching the news in disbelief"". He says they will be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" ""How does he
expect families to the pay the bills, to pay the rent, to put food on the table
and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region. Earlier, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young asked the prime minister how much money would be made available.

The health secretary says a ""comprehensive package of support"" will help the region weather the ""tough"" restrictions. He says Greater Manchester will get Â£22m for contact tracing and testing but a deal for business support has not been done. He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions. ""It's difficult to call when that might be. We're currently in the high risk category, we may move to the very high-risk category,"" Mr Fell said. Earlier the government released today's figures showing the number of new cases and deaths,which you can read more about here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update the House of Commons on England's latest Covid restrictions shortly. MPs are sure to ask him about support for Greater Manchester, after the PM announced the region isset to enter tier 3. The company suggested that the expected fall in the global birth rate following lockdown could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year Sales of Durex condoms jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm of the business, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. During the first UK lockdown, people who did not live in same household were not allowed to meet.

Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row. Interviewed by a California radio station, he said: ""That other stuff, it's like in 'The Godfather': Nothing
personal, strictly business. As far as I'm concerned, I just
want to do my job and take care of the people of this country."" There are more than 8.2 million confirmed cases in the US, and more than 220,000 people have died with coronavirus.      Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999905
"This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' The failure to agree a Â£65m package of support will mean a ""winter of hardship"" for Greater Manchester if tier three measures are imposed, the region's mayor has said. Andy Burnham said tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"". He added ministers ""walked away"" from negotiations over aid earlier today. Tier three rules mean most pubs and bars will close, and there will be extra restrictions on household mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to hold a press conference at 17:00 BST, which will be followed by a statement in the House of Commons from Health Secretary Matt Hancock at 19:00. Speaking alongside other local leaders, Mr Burnham said: ""At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities."" The former MP added he was still willing to do a deal with the government ""but it cannot be on the terms the government has offered today"". What Covid tier is my area in? How do I get a coronavirus test? Latest reaction as Greater Manchester prepares to join Tier 3 But addressing the people of Greater Manchester, he added: ""Please, everybody, observe the law at all times and follow the public health advice. Above all else, please look out for each other, as I know you will."" The latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Burnham's comments follow 10 days of talks between the government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8 million population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""collapse of the talks"" was a ""sign of government failure"". Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, household mixing is banned both indoors and outdoors, and there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m of central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits - but in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood that Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more, proportionately, than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. After 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over down to a gap of Â£5m. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Burnham had been ""unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control"". He added: ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" Responding to the news, Sir Keir said: ""The Conservatives have been treating local communities, particularly in the Midlands, North West and North East, and their leaders with contempt. ""Labour recognise the need for stricter public health restrictions. However, that must be accompanied by extra financial support."" William Wragg, Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, tweeted that the ""sense of failure"" was ""overwhelming"". He added: ""I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in House of Commons this evening."" The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that discussions were planned about South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Greater Manchester will move into Tier 3 Greater Manchester will move to England's highest tier of coronavirus restrictions from Friday at 00:01 BST, the prime minister has announced. Speaking at No 10, Boris Johnson said ""not to act now"" would put the lives of Manchester's residents ""at risk"". He said a ""generous"" offer of financial support had been made to the region but that Mayor Andy Burnham had refused it. Mr Burnham said he had not been offered enough to ""protect the poorest people in our communities"". Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. 'Heartbreak' over region's tier 3 status What Covid tier is my area in? What will the Tier 3 rules for Greater Manchester be? Kuenssberg: Greater Manchester deal falls over a Â£5m gap Ahead of the Downing Street press conference, Mr Burnham - speaking alongside other local leaders - said that without a ""bare minimum"" of Â£65m in additional business support, tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"" among the region's 2.8 million population. Health Secretary Matt Hancock later told the House of Commons that a Â£60m offer previously made to local leaders remained ""on the table"". This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' On the inability to agree on financial help, Mr Johnson said: ""I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together."" He added Greater Manchester would receive Â£22m in funding as part of a ""comprehensive package of support"" but that the ""door was open to continue the conversation"" about further aid, so long as it was in line with that offered to other areas in same position. The Â£22m mentioned by Mr Johnson - which is for expenses such as local enforcement and test and trace - is separate to the Â£60m that Mr Hancock spoke of. In addition, thenew Job Support Schemewill cover 67% of the wages - funded by employers and the government - of people affected by tier three closures. Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North"" (as some now call him)? All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Explaining the decision to impose tougher restrictions on Greater Manchester, Mr Hancock said hospital admissions in the region were higher now than at the end of March. ""There are now more Covid-19 patients in Greater Manchester hospitals than in the whole of the South West and the South East combined,"" he added. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, meanwhile, said residents of Manchester would be ""watching the news in disbelief"". He said they would be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party would force a Commons vote on Wednesday, demanding a ""fair deal"" for areas facing tier three restrictions. Allow Twitter content?

He added: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't."" However, six other Conservative MPs from the region havewritten to Mr Burnham,externalto express their ""concern and deep disappointment"" about what they called ""his failure to come to an agreement with the Government"" on a support package. The signatories ask Mr Burnham to ""make way"" for ""local MPs and council leaders"" to ""have a go at getting a sensible settlement"". Kate Nicholls - the head of industry body UKHospitality - described the move to tier three as ""another huge blow for our sector and a very bitter disappointment for hospitality businesses in Manchester"". ""We need a practical and workable package of support for the whole of Manchester's hospitality sector in order to keep these businesses afloat and jobs alive,"" she said. ""Jobs, once lost, are not always easily revived and businesses closed not easily reopened."" Meanwhile, the PM confirmed that conversations were ongoing with leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East about the possibility of moving to the very high alert level, tier three.

But speaking alongside Mr Johnson at Downing Street, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said this approach would be ""inappropriate"" for parts of England where the disease was lower and ""very hard to justify for some communities"".

"The sale of Durex jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. Total group sales in the last quarter rose 13% to Â£3.5bn on last year. ""Relaxations of social distancing regulations resulted in improved demand for our sexual well-being products,"" it said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. However, the company suggested on Tuesday that this spring fall could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year, with an expected fall in the global birth rate. ""There is evidence that birth rates will be further lowered in coming quarters as a result of behaviour changes related to the pandemic,"" it said. ""Our performance has been led by an increase in hygiene and health volumes,"" said boss Laxman Narasimhan. Sales of Dettol-branded sprays, wipes and liquid climbed more than 50% compared to the same period last year. Airwick and Finish continued to grow strongly, with consumers continuing to spend more time at home compared to a year ago, the company said. Reckitt said that Covid-19 was accentuating trends such as ""urbanisation and global warming, and their impact on their spread of infection, re-enforcing the necessity of improved hygiene"". It also highlighted a growing demand for self-care and a growing importance of sexual health and wellbeing. ""As consumers have sought to embrace self-care for themselves and their families, we have seen growth in preventative treatments, such as vitamins, minerals and supplements,"" it said. While many retailers have been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, which has seen an acceleration towards online sales, some benefitted from lockdown. Ann Summers, which is known for selling lingerie and sex toys, said overall sales were up 14.4% in the three months to 26 September compared with last year. ""2020 has been an extraordinary time, and as a business we have seen customers taking time to truly invest in their mental and sexual wellbeing,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have also seen increased engagement on our expert advice videos and content hub online, as customers seek out new and exciting ways to survive lockdown."" There was also a big surge over the summer and early autumn in people buying household cleaners, disinfectant, and bleach, according to retail analysis firm Kantar. Sales of household cleaners grew by Â£38m in the 12 weeks to 4 October compared with last year. In the same time period, antiseptic and disinfectant sales were up more than 57%, while bleach and toilet cleaner sales rose almost 10%. Reckitt's latest results were well received by analysts. ''Reckitt Benckiser has cleaned up on our obsession with hygiene,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Our pursuit of cleanliness during the pandemic has been hugely beneficial for the group, and the signs are that the crisis is leading to a longer-term behaviour shift with consumers demanding reassurance that workplaces, shops and public transport are germ free."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: ""Reckitt was already seeing the benefits of improving hygiene and self-care awareness, and the pandemic has moved growth to another level.""

"Greater Manchester to move to tier 3 - very high- alert level from 00:01 on Friday Measures imposed by government after collapse of talks to agree deal with local leaders Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls move ""brutal"" and asks Parliament to intervene Region to get Â£22m for testing and tracing but no funding agreed for business support But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says an offer of Â£60m is ""still on the table"" Number of UK deaths with Covid on the certificate up 38% in a week, ONS figures show Republic of Ireland moving to a new, very high, level of coronavirus restrictions France has reported more than 2,000 people in intensive care - the first time since May Edited by Martha Buckley We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Today's reporting of the pandemic was brought to you by: Francesca Gillett, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Marie Jackson, Emma Owen, Martha Buckley, John Hand, Paul Seddon and Mal Siret. Thanks for reading. The Duchess of Cambridge has officially launched her Hold Still photo exhibition, comprised of 100 images taken in lockdown. She and the Duke of Cambridge met specialist oncology pharmacist Joyce Duah, whose photo of her colleagues writing their names and smiley faces on their PPE aprons was one of those selected. Catherine told Joyce: ""It had such an impact - it captured the moment, it was a look behind the scenes."" The royal pair also travelled to Waterloo, south London, to view one of the 80 public exhibition sites across the country being used for the project over the next four weeks. All 100 portraits will feature in a special exhibition hosted by the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire from Friday. Apart from the drama surrounding the tier-three restrictions for Greater Manchester, here's what you might have missed if you're just catching up. Liverpool City Region was the first area of England to enter tier 3. Labour says it will force a Commons vote tomorrow on a ""one nation"" approach to support for regions facing additional restrictions. They have put down a motion calling on ministers to publish ""clear and fair"" national criteria for economic support. The motion adds that financial help should also be voted on by MPs. The vote is non-binding but is an attempt to put pressure on the government over the issue of how support is determined. Here's a reminder of the main developments surrounding Greater Manchester's Covid-19 restrictions: Melania Trump will not be joining the US president at a campaign rally later today ""out of an abundance of caution"" As a bitter row erupts in England over strict restrictions being imposed in Manchester, here is a round-up of some of the other key headlines from around the world: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North""? (As some now call him). All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Council leaders in West Yorkshire have issued a statement saying the region will remain in tier two for the moment. In a statement, they said national and local public health experts agreed there was ""not a case"" to move the region to tier three this week. The leaders however repeated their call foradditional support,externalfor the area to help it through the tier two restrictions. Andy Preston, independent mayor of Middlesbrough, speaking on  BBC Radio 4 earlier today said that the city risked being put into tier three on the basis of flawed data. He said: âThey donât have the local knowledge that we have so Iâm terrified to know that conversations are going [on] in No 10 about putting Middlesbrough into tier three with bad data and based inferences and still no conversations, so Iâm wholly dispirited.â He added: âWe need a lot of money. We are facing monstrous problems here and the government seems oblivious,"" he said. ""I need to be talking to ministers and explaining the number of free school meals kids here is ballooning and the job losses are just starting. ""Weâre hitting a catastrophe of poverty and deprivation and we need serious money and serious commitment from the government to deal with it.â Labour's shadow chancellor Jonathan Ashworth said people across Greater Manchester ""will be watching the news in disbelief"". He says they will be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" ""How does he
expect families to the pay the bills, to pay the rent, to put food on the table
and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region. Earlier, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young asked the prime minister how much money would be made available. This video can not be played Covid-19: PM says 'huge sums' are being invested to help local authorities House of CommonsParliament Matt Hancock tells MPs placing Greater Manchester into tier three was a ""difficult decision"" but needed because of the spread of the virus. The health secretary says a ""comprehensive package of support"" will help the region weather the ""tough"" restrictions. He says Greater Manchester will get Â£22m for contact tracing and testing but a deal for business support has not been done. He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions. ""It's difficult to call when that might be. We're currently in the high risk category, we may move to the very high-risk category,"" Mr Fell said. Earlier the government released today's figures showing the number of new cases and deaths,which you can read more about here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update the House of Commons on England's latest Covid restrictions shortly. MPs are sure to ask him about support for Greater Manchester, after the PM announced the region isset to enter tier 3. The company suggested that the expected fall in the global birth rate following lockdown could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year Sales of Durex condoms jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm of the business, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. During the first UK lockdown, people who did not live in same household were not allowed to meet. The full story is here. Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row. Interviewed by a California radio station, he said: ""That other stuff, it's like in 'The Godfather': Nothing
personal, strictly business. As far as I'm concerned, I just
want to do my job and take care of the people of this country."" There are more than 8.2 million confirmed cases in the US, and more than 220,000 people have died with coronavirus.      Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999851
"This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' The failure to agree a Â£65m package of support will mean a ""winter of hardship"" for Greater Manchester if tier three measures are imposed, the region's mayor has said. Andy Burnham said tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"". He added ministers ""walked away"" from negotiations over aid earlier today. Tier three rules mean most pubs and bars will close, and there will be extra restrictions on household mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to hold a press conference at 17:00 BST, which will be followed by a statement in the House of Commons from Health Secretary Matt Hancock at 19:00. Speaking alongside other local leaders, Mr Burnham said: ""At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities."" The former MP added he was still willing to do a deal with the government ""but it cannot be on the terms the government has offered today"". What Covid tier is my area in? How do I get a coronavirus test? Latest reaction as Greater Manchester prepares to join Tier 3 But addressing the people of Greater Manchester, he added: ""Please, everybody, observe the law at all times and follow the public health advice. Above all else, please look out for each other, as I know you will."" The latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Burnham's comments follow 10 days of talks between the government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8 million population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""collapse of the talks"" was a ""sign of government failure"". Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, household mixing is banned both indoors and outdoors, and there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m of central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits - but in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood that Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more, proportionately, than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. After 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over down to a gap of Â£5m. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Burnham had been ""unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control"". He added: ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" Responding to the news, Sir Keir said: ""The Conservatives have been treating local communities, particularly in the Midlands, North West and North East, and their leaders with contempt. ""Labour recognise the need for stricter public health restrictions. However, that must be accompanied by extra financial support."" William Wragg, Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, tweeted that the ""sense of failure"" was ""overwhelming"". He added: ""I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in House of Commons this evening."" The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that discussions were planned about South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". This video can not be played What is the new three tier system after lockdown? Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told to stay at home from Friday, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. And in Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's.

and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region.

He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions.

Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row.

Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9201187
"This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' The failure to agree a Â£65m package of support will mean a ""winter of hardship"" for Greater Manchester if tier three measures are imposed, the region's mayor has said. Andy Burnham said tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"". He added ministers ""walked away"" from negotiations over aid earlier today. Tier three rules mean most pubs and bars will close, and there will be extra restrictions on household mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to hold a press conference at 17:00 BST, which will be followed by a statement in the House of Commons from Health Secretary Matt Hancock at 19:00. Speaking alongside other local leaders, Mr Burnham said: ""At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities."" The former MP added he was still willing to do a deal with the government ""but it cannot be on the terms the government has offered today"". What Covid tier is my area in? How do I get a coronavirus test? Latest reaction as Greater Manchester prepares to join Tier 3 But addressing the people of Greater Manchester, he added: ""Please, everybody, observe the law at all times and follow the public health advice. Above all else, please look out for each other, as I know you will."" The latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Burnham's comments follow 10 days of talks between the government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8 million population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""collapse of the talks"" was a ""sign of government failure"". Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, household mixing is banned both indoors and outdoors, and there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m of central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits - but in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood that Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more, proportionately, than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. After 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over down to a gap of Â£5m. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Burnham had been ""unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control"". He added: ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" Responding to the news, Sir Keir said: ""The Conservatives have been treating local communities, particularly in the Midlands, North West and North East, and their leaders with contempt. ""Labour recognise the need for stricter public health restrictions. However, that must be accompanied by extra financial support."" William Wragg, Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, tweeted that the ""sense of failure"" was ""overwhelming"". He added: ""I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in House of Commons this evening."" The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that discussions were planned about South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". This video can not be played What is the new three tier system after lockdown? Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told to stay at home from Friday, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. And in Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's.

"Hospitality chiefs are scrambling to work out whether working lunches in English pubs and restaurants could be exempt from new Covid restrictions. Trade body UK Hospitality said it wants government clarification, as many central London venues rely on workers meeting up over lunch. People from different households in England are banned from meeting in pubs in Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. But the rules suggest meetings are allowed for business purposes. Current government guidance advises working from home as much as possible and limiting social contact. The question is whether rules allowing necessary business meetings come first, or rules banning the mixing of households, UK Hospitality chief Kate Nicholls told the BBC. ""We don't know,"" she said. ""It's a grey area."" A Number 10 spokesman suggested that the loophole may only be available to sole traders or freelancers with no business premises to conduct meetings as an alternative. What Covid tier is my area in? Can I eat out with someone from a different tier? When and how are pubs allowed to open? Ms Nicholls said businesses would need to know how they judge whether a lunch is for work purposes or whether potential patrons are breaking the rules,. ""This could be a vital revenue stream for some venues at a time when they are trying to operate under extreme restrictions,"" Ms she said. ""It is not likely to be a magic wand for the sector, though."". For Tier 3 regions, being open to lunchtime custom would also mean businesses could not receive employment support, since that is for businesses closed by the restrictions. ""It also relies on people physically coming together to hold their meetings at a time when the trend appears to be towards working from home and remote meetings,"" she said. ""If workers can see the benefit in a face-to-face meeting in a safe setting, then they need to know the option is there for them. That's something which may not have been communicated too well by the government."" Last week, UK Hospitality warned that tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector. Households are not allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Ms Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. She has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"".

"Google has been issued with huge fines in the EU over market dominance The US government has filed charges against Google, accusing the company of violating competition law to preserve its monopoly over internet searches and online advertising. The lawsuit marks the biggest challenge brought by US regulators against a major tech company in years. It follows more than a year of investigation and comes as the biggest tech firms face intense scrutiny of their practices at home and abroad. Google called the case ""deeply flawed"". The company has maintained that its sector remains intensely competitive and that its practices put customers first. ""People use Google because they choose to - not because they're forced to or because they can't find alternatives,"" it said. The charges, filed in federal court, were brought by the US Department of Justice and 11 other states. The lawsuit focuses on the billions of dollars Google pays each year to ensure its search engine is installed as the default option on browsers and devices such as mobile phones. Officials said those deals have helped secure Google's place as the ""gatekeeper"" to the internet, allowing it to own or control the distribution channels for about 80% of search queries in the US. Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai at a 2018 hearing in Washington. In July, he assured Congress, ""We conduct ourselves to the highest standard"". ""Google has thus foreclosed competition for internet search,"" the lawsuit said. ""General search engine competitors are denied vital distribution, scale, and product recognition - ensuring they have no real chance to challenge Google."" It added: ""Google is so dominant that 'Google' is not only a noun to identify the company and the Google search engine but also a verb that means to search the internet."" The suit said the deals have hurt the public by damaging search quality in terms of privacy and data protection, reducing choice and thwarting innovation. Sally Hubbard, who works for the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that has long pushed for more aggressive action against big tech firms, said focusing on Google's search distribution deals was one of the easiest legal cases to make against the company. On Twitter she said the lawsuit had ""been so long coming but it's wonderful to see"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The case could be the first of many in the US that challenge the dominance of big tech firms and potentially lead to their break-up. Other states have launched their own investigations, and said they may join the suit filed on Tuesday or file their own. Politicians in Congress have also called for action against Google and fellow tech firms Amazon, Facebook and Apple in an effort that has united Democrats and Republicans. US tech giants accused of 'monopoly power' After the questions: What next for Big Tech? The decision to file the lawsuit just a few weeks before the US presidential election has raised questions about whether it was simply a move by the Trump administration to prove its willingness to challenge the influence of the sector if it gains a second term. But officials said they had not rushed the investigation to ensure it was filed before the election - noting that for years, many advocates have said the government was moving too slowly on such issues. ""We're acting when the facts and the law warranted,"" deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen said,adding that the department's review of competition practices in the technology sector is continuing. Google has faced similar claims in the European Union. Itis already appealing against â¬8.2bn ($9.5bn; Â£7.3bn) in fines demanded by the European Commissionwhich include: in 2017,a â¬2.4bn fine over shopping results in 2018,a â¬4.3bn fine over claims it used Android software to unfairly promote its own apps in 2019,a â¬1.5bn fine for blocking adverts from rival search engines. Google parent Alphabet, which has a market value of more than $1tn, is expected to fight the allegations in the US as well. Its share price was little changed on Tuesday, despite the news. Taking on a giant like Google will be one of biggest competition cases in decades. But the case - to decide if the California-based company abuses its market power - could last years. European regulators have led the way in taking action against the tech giants. But this move by the US Department of Justice is a sign that the mood has turned against them at home too. The complaint says that two decades ago Google was a scrappy innovative start-up - but now it's the monopoly gatekeeper to the internet. Google stands accused of using anti-competitive tactics to shut out rivals and extend that monopoly. Google says people use it because they choose to rather than being forced.

"More than 100,000 women have had their clothes digitally removed from images Faked nude images of more than 100,000 women have been created from social media pictures and shared online, according to a new report. Clothes are digitally removed from pictures of women by Artificial Intelligence (AI), and spread on the messaging app Telegram. Some of those targeted ""appeared to be underage"", the report by intelligence company Sensity said. But those running the service said it was simply ""entertainment"". The BBC has tested the software and received poor results. Sensity claim the technology used is a ""deepfake bot"". Deepfakes are computer-generated, often realistic images and video, based on a real template. One of its uses has been to create faked pornographic video clips of celebrities. But Sensity's chief executive Giorgio Patrini said the shift to using photos of private individuals is relatively new. ""Having a social media account with public photos is enough for anyone to become a target,"" he warned. The artificial intelligence-powered bot lives inside a Telegram private messaging channel. Users can send the bot a photo of a woman, and it will digitally remove her clothes in minutes, at no cost. The BBC tested multiple images, all with the subjects' consent, and none were completely realistic - our results included a photo of a woman with a belly button on her diaphragm. A similar app was shut down last year, but it is believed there are cracked versions of the software in circulation. The administrator running the service, known only as ""P"" said: ""I don't care that much. This is entertainment that does not carry violence. ""No one will blackmail anyone with this, since the quality is unrealistic."" He also said the team looks at what photos are shared, and ""when we see minors we block the user for good."" Illustrations from the report show how messaging the bot will result in a modified version being sent back But the decision on whether to share the photo with others is up to whoever used the bot to create it in the first place, he said. Defending its relative level of harm, he added: ""There are wars, diseases, many bad things that are harmful in the world."" He has also claimed he will soon remove all of the images. Telegram has not responded to a request for comment. Sensity reported that between July 2019 and 2020, approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had fake naked images of them shared publicly. Its investigation found that some of the images appeared underage, ""suggesting that some users were primarily using the bot to generate and share paedophilic content."" Sensity said the bot has had significant advertising on the Russian social media site VK, and a survey on the platform showed that most users were from Russia and ex-USSR countries. But VK said: ""It doesn't tolerate such content or links on the platform and blocks communities that distribute them."" Telegram was officiallybanned in Russiauntil earlier this year. ""Many of these websites or apps do not hide or operate underground, because they are not strictly outlawed,"" said Sensity's Giorgio Patrini. ""Until that happens, I am afraid it will only get worse."" This video can not be played Actress Bella Thorne opens up about her experience of deepfake abuse The authors of the report say they have shared all their findings with Telegram, VK and relevant law enforcement agencies, but have not had a response. Nina Schick, author of the book Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse, said deepfake creators were all over the world, and that legal protections were ""playing catch-up"" with the technology. ""It's only a matter of time until that content becomes more sophisticated. The number of deepfake porn videos seems to be doubling every six months,"" she said. ""Our legal systems are not fit for purpose on this issue.

Already, a record 29 million ballots have been cast nationwide. So what were the big moments from today?  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

It's a story fit for 2020, but no need to panic yet. The fridge-sized space rock isn't big enough to do any damage.

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"The Welsh Government has again urged Downing Street to start the new job support scheme early in Wales to coincide with lockdown Businesses fear for their survival if that doesn't happen An additional Â£150m is available to help businesses through the firebreak New grants up to Â£300 are also to be made available for carers in Wales However train and bus operators have been asked to reduce services to highlight the ""stay at home"" message The beauty sector needs VAT cut to match the hospitality sector to survive winter, Swansea East MP says More national lockdowns have not been ruled out Ten more people have died with Covid-19 and a further 1,148 cases reported David Dulin and Matt Lloyd That's all from our live coverage of the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus update. Here are your headlines:  Join us again tomorrow for the latest updates. Good bye    The number of new positive cases of coronavirus stands at 1,148 with 10 deaths, the latest Public Health Wales figures show. There were nearly 12,500 tests carried out on Monday. Hospital outbreaks in a south Wales valleys health board are behind a rise in weekly Covid-19 deaths in Wales, ONS figures have shown. There were37 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in Wales in the week ending 9 October. This is an increase on the 25 deaths the week before. There were 23 deaths registered in Cwm Taf Morgannwg First Minister Mark Drakeford has written again to Chancellor Rishi Sunak warning ""many staff will be laid off"" in leisure and hospitality as a result of the firebreak lockdown in Wales. He said it is because they will not fulfil the eligibility criteria to be enrolled for the last week of the Job Retention Scheme (JRS). ""Employers with no income will be faced with the difficult decision of paying all of the wage costs of these employees or making them redundant,"" Mr Drakeford said in the letter. ""It makes no sense from the point of view of the UK Exchequer to have to meet the possible long-term costs of paying out-of-work benefits to these individuals for the sake of one weekâs support on the JRS. ""Will you therefore agree in these exceptional circumstances to waive the requirement for employees for whom JRS is claimed for this period to have been on furlough for at least three weeks prior to 30 June?"" Any hopes of this firebreak being a one-off appear to have been dashed. Ministers say they cannot rule out imposing another firebreak early in 2021 if Covid-19 starts spreading quickly again at Christmas. Mr Skates urged people to stick to the rules during the two-week lockdown. Although the impact wonât be known for some time, scientific advisers say it is possible the R rate could drop from 1.4 to 0.8. âThat would, in itself, buy us enough time, give us the headroom, to get through to Christmas and the New Year,â Mr Skates told the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus news briefing. âBut we could not rule out the possibility of another firebreak if transmission rates increase dramatically over the Christmas period."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to hold a press conference at 17:00 when he is expected to set out the next steps in relation to coronavirus controls in Greater Manchester, Downing Street has said. The Prime Ministerâs official spokesman said talks had continued on Tuesday morning at official level ahead of the governmentâs midday deadline for an agreement on the introduction of tier three controls. He said Mr Johnson had also spoken directly to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham following the passing of the deadline, adding: The talks have been ongoing this morning. I am not in a position to confirm how that has been resolved.  The Welsh Government is unable to make direct payments to workers to make up a gap between the Wales' lockdown and the UK government's new Job Support Scheme (JSS), Ken Skates said. Wales will go into lockdown on Friday but the JSS does not take affect until 1 November. The Economy Minister said the Welsh Government does not have access to people's tax records. However Welsh ministers were willing to pay the Treasury the additional costs of administering starting the scheme earlier in Wales, at an estimated cost of around Â£11m, Mr Skates said. But he added the Welsh Government was also ""working through"" other ways of making up workers' earnings in the first week of the Welsh lockdown. The Welsh Conservatives have been critical of the firebreak announcement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Get Me Out Of Here! might help cheer up a pandemic-weary nation, Ken Skates said. Filming at Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Conwy, is to continue despite the Wales lockdown. The Economy Minister was asked to respond to concerns of local businesses who will have to shut down. âIf it can continue in a Covid-safe way then clearly it has long-term benefits in terms of promoting north Wales,â he said. âI know that the producersâ¦ are incredibly keen to demonstrate that they can produce a show of this nature during a pandemic in a responsible way. âIt may well be that the television-watching public just need something like that right now because there is a wellbeing and mental health crisis at the moment and we do need things that can unite people and this sort of programme can often do that.â Allowing non-essential shops to remain open would ""decrease the impact of the firebreak"" according to Mr Skates. The Economy Minister was sked why non-essential retail should close while scientific advice showed it would have ""very minimal impact"" on the transmission rate. He replied: ""In aggregate it makes a significant difference"". However the Welsh Government believes this firebreak gives retailers ""the best possibility of having a buoyant Christmas period"". ""We wish this to be a short, sharp shock to make sure that it's just a contained two-week period, that gives society and businesses the best possible prospect of then making it through, with certainty, to the end of the year, particularly through that crucial Christmas period,"" said Mr Skates. ""I'm sure that most people in retail would wish to have a short two week period of closure if, in exchange, they get a lengthier period of certainty. ""Contrast that with what's happening elsewhere in the UK and further afield where much lengthier measures are being introduced."" A fund to help businesses through the firebreak has been doubled, according to Mr Skates. He said the Welsh Government was ""injecting an additional Â£150m of new money"" into the Economic Resilience Fund. ""This means there will now be nearly Â£300m of Welsh Government funding available to support businesses affected by the firebreak,"" he added. Grants of up to Â£300 will be made available to carers in
Wales for essentials. Julie Morgan, deputy health minister, said a fund of Â£1m was
being made available to help unpaid carers cope with the financial pressures of
Covid-19. They can cover a range of items, including food, household
items such as furniture or white goods, or electronics like laptops. About 55,300 people in Wales receive a carerâs allowance. The fund will be available up to 31 March. Train and bus operators have been asked to reduce services during the firebreak to highlight the ""stay at home"" message. Mr Skates said: âServices will be similar to those in August and will be achieved through cancellations and changes to timetabled services. ""It is imperative that remaining capacity is safeguarded for key workers and essential journeys. ""Those who must use public transport should read advice carefully and check directly with operators before travelling. ""Buses and trains used by pupils to access schools and those that cross the border to England, where current restrictions are different, will be protected."" Businesses in Wales will be supported with a ""combinationâ of UK government and Welsh Government support, Mr Skates said. The Economy Minister said businesses ""should be able"" to receive Job Retention Scheme support for eligible employees for the period between 23 and 31 October - and âthe new enhancedâ Job Support Scheme from 1 November. But he added: âI do realise that having to access two different forms of support is far from ideal and that some businesses will struggle to take full advantage at this late stage of the Job Retention Scheme. âWe pressed the Chancellor to bring forward the new Job Support Scheme to ensure that all those working for businesses which are forced to close, would receive financial support for all employees and would not have to access two schemes during this firebreak. ""We even offered to make up the difference between the funding for each employee under the Job Retention Scheme and the Job Support Scheme. But the UK government has so far refused this offer."" Wales Economy Minister Ken Skates said doing nothing was ""not an option"" after a firebreak lockdown was announced. All non-food retail, hospitality, close-contact services, events and tourism businesses, including hotels, must close when the 17-day lockdown starts on Friday. âIf we do not act now with a two week firebreak, there is a very real risk our NHS will be overwhelmed and we could see even larger numbers people dying with coronavirus this winter,â he said. âAs it has done throughout this crisis, the Welsh Government is working tirelessly to support our economy through this crisis and to protect jobsâ. The firebreak begins at 18:00 on Friday and ends at 00:01 on Monday, 9 November. The beauty sector needs a VAT cut to match what the hospitality sector received in order to survive winter, an MP has said. Labour Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris said she fears many beauty businesses will go under by Christmas without more support. One Cardiff hairdresser owner has said the new Job Support Scheme ""wasn't viable"" for businesses like theirs. Businesses in Wales have expressed concern about the 17-day lockdown which is due to start on Friday. A gap between the start of the lockdown and the UK government's new Job Support Scheme is a""significant barrier"" for firms trying to survive. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) urged the UK and Welsh governments to work together. The Treasury said employers could use furlough until the end of October. Volunteers will be deliberatelyexposed to the virus in trialsdue to start in January. The trials aim to speed up the race to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The government is putting Â£33.6m towards the groundbreaking work. Safety will be a number one priority, experts insist. The plans will need ethical approval and sign-off from regulators before they can go ahead. Human challenge studies provide a faster way to test vaccines because you don't have to wait for people to be exposed to an illness naturally. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of today's Welsh Government briefing. We're expecting Ken Skates, the Economy Minister, to start speaking at around 12:15 BST.

"The couple were seen posing on tracks in Whitby in July, accompanied by wedding guests A couple who posed for wedding photographs on railway tracks in North Yorkshire have been condemned by Network Rail. They were caught on CCTV standing on a line near Whitby in July. More than 5,000 trespassing incidents were recorded between June and September, with many involving people using the railways as a backdrop for photos. Network Rail said taking selfies and photo shoots was ""plain stupidity"". In September alone some 1,239 incidents were recorded - a 17% rise. Network Rail shared an image of a photo shoot on a train line in Cilfrew, Neath Port Talbot Supt Alison Evans, of British Transport Police, said: ""The railway is not an appropriate or safe setting for a photographic backdrop, no matter how scenic the setting. ""Every time someone strays on to the rail network they are not only putting themselves at risk of serious, life-threatening injury, but also delaying essential journeys."" More stories from Yorkshire People posing for photos on rail lines criticised Hollyoaks actor Ellis Hollins was forced to apologise in July after posting images on social media from a photoshoot on the railway. He admitted it was ""irresponsible"" and he was ""careless to take part in such a dangerous situation"". Another image showed people walking down a railway track in Harlech in Gwynedd Network Rail has launched a ""You vs Train"" campaign in partnership with British Transport Police to highlight the issue of young people trespassing. The number of incidents involving children at 51 targeted locations has fallen in each of the past two years. Allan Spence, of Network Rail, said: ""Wedding photos or selfies on the track are just plain stupidity.

"Talks between Greater Manchester and the government on the region entering tier three restrictions have concluded without an agreement, the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick accused Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham of being ""unwilling"" to take the action needed to control the virus. Tier three measures are expected to be imposed on the region as a result. Local leaders had been arguing for at least Â£65m in financial support. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later, while Health Secretary Matt Hancock will give a Commons statement at 19:00 BST. Mr Jenrick said: ""I'm disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of the situation, the mayor has been unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the government. ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" The ""very high"" alert level - also known as tier three - would mean closing pubs and bars which do not serve meals, and additional restrictions on households mixing. So far, only theLiverpool City RegionandLancashirehave been moved into tier three. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood the government was willing to offer Â£60m but local leaders wanted Â£65m. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Who is Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham? The government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - have been embroiled in 10 days of talks over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8m population from tier two to the highest restrictions. The region has been under local restrictions since July. Local leaders in Greater Manchester had been calling for greater financial support to help those who would be affected by tier three restrictions. Currently,the new Job Support Schemecovers 67% of the wages - covered by employers and the government - of people affected by tier three closures, as opposed to the 80% offered during the UK's first lockdown. Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it is fair to recognise that if you put a place under restrictions for as long as we've been under restrictions it grinds people down. It pushes businesses closer to the brink."" But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Commons that Greater Manchester was ""being treated exactly the same as every part of our United Kingdom"". The chancellor reiterated that there was a ""national funding formula"" of Â£8 per head for all local authorities entering tier three. Business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Today Â£22m had been offered to Greater Manchester - equivalent to Â£8 per person - and there would be ""additional support commensurate with what we have done in Liverpool City Region and in Lancashire"". Sir Graham Brady, the Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, earlier said he believed a deal would be reached. Sir Graham, who is also chair of the powerful 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, said he thought would be ""very unfortunate"" if restrictions were imposed on the region. Earlier, BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said local leaders had been asking for Â£75m. The figure included the Â£22m given to areas that go into tier three, as well as the extra business support that was negotiated by Lancashire and the Liverpool City regions when they moved into top restrictions. Both regions received Â£30m in business support. This support scaled up to the larger Greater Manchester population would equate to about Â£56m. Mr Johnson will hold the press conference at 17:00 BST with Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, and Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England. Earlier, Mr Burnham said he would not ""break the law"" if no agreement was reached between both sides and the government imposed tier three measures on Greater Manchester. ""It's their prerogative to do what they think is needed,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But I would say to them that I don't think it will help us bring people with what they want to do to control this virus. I think it would be better to come to an agreement."" It comes as the number of weekly registered coronavirus deaths in England and Wales rose by 438 and increased by a third in the space of seven days, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that discussions are planned for South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. In Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's.

"This video can not be played Burnham: 'It can't be right to close businesses without support' The failure to agree a Â£65m package of support will mean a ""winter of hardship"" for Greater Manchester if tier three measures are imposed, the region's mayor has said. Andy Burnham said tighter measures ""would be certain to increase levels of poverty, homelessness and hardship"". He added ministers ""walked away"" from negotiations over aid earlier today. Tier three rules mean most pubs and bars will close, and there will be extra restrictions on household mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to hold a press conference at 17:00 BST, which will be followed by a statement in the House of Commons from Health Secretary Matt Hancock at 19:00. Speaking alongside other local leaders, Mr Burnham said: ""At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities."" The former MP added he was still willing to do a deal with the government ""but it cannot be on the terms the government has offered today"". What Covid tier is my area in? How do I get a coronavirus test? Latest reaction as Greater Manchester prepares to join Tier 3 But addressing the people of Greater Manchester, he added: ""Please, everybody, observe the law at all times and follow the public health advice. Above all else, please look out for each other, as I know you will."" The latestgovernment figures,externalshowed that, on Tuesday, the UK recorded a further 21,330 coronavirus cases and a further 241 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Burnham's comments follow 10 days of talks between the government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8 million population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""collapse of the talks"" was a ""sign of government failure"". Greater Manchester is currently under tier two rules, meaning pubs and restaurants must close at 22:00, there is no household mixing indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Under tier three rules - currently only applied to Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, household mixing is banned both indoors and outdoors, and there is guidance against travelling in or out of the area. Greater Manchester was offered Â£60m of central government to help support businesses under the new Tier 3 limits - but in a conversation with the prime minister, Mayor Andy Burnham suggested it was not possible to accept less than Â£65m. Greater Manchester leaders originally submitted a request for Â£90m, which had been costed by a former Treasury official. On Tuesday morning they discussed Â£75m with government officials, which would have covered the period until the end of the financial year. It's understood that Boris Johnson and Mr Burnham discussed a figure of Â£60m but were unable to agree. Ministers were reluctant to set a precedent of giving one region more, proportionately, than another, especially given ongoing talks with several other parts of the country which could also face tougher restrictions. It is now not clear what financial support the region will receive. After 10 days of talks (of a kind) and billions spent during this crisis, it is quite something that the deal fell over down to a gap of Â£5m. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Burnham had been ""unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control"". He added: ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" Responding to the news, Sir Keir said: ""The Conservatives have been treating local communities, particularly in the Midlands, North West and North East, and their leaders with contempt. ""Labour recognise the need for stricter public health restrictions. However, that must be accompanied by extra financial support."" William Wragg, Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, tweeted that the ""sense of failure"" was ""overwhelming"". He added: ""I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in House of Commons this evening."" The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that discussions were planned about South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier.

"Speaking outside the Manchester's central library, Andy Burnham insisted the city was ""fighting back"" Once a New Labour rising star, twice a defeated Labour leadership candidate, now mayor of Greater Manchester. While other ex-Labour ministers of his generation can be found on the backbenches or the set of Strictly, Andy Burnham has found a new political power base. His confrontation with the government over coronavirus restrictions has dominated the news over recent days and he has now been dubbed ""the King of the North"" by one of the city's bars. Mayor urges PM to break Manchester 'impasse' PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester Burnham elected Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham was born in 1970 in Liverpool to telephone engineer Kenneth and receptionist Eileen. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to Culcheth, a commuter belt village halfway between the city he was born in and the city he now represents as mayor. The middle of three brothers, he describes his family as ""tight-knit"", with Everton Football Club being ""the glue that keeps us together"". His family on both sides came from Liverpool but he says that growing up he spent more time in Manchester and was ""massively into the Manchester music of the mid and late 80s"". He told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast that he did go to the famous Hacienda nightclub, but added: ""I probably won't say much more about that,"" The 80s drama Boys from the Blackstuff told the story of Liverpudlian men trying to find work amid an economic recession Aged 15 he joined the Labour Party, having partly been politicised by the miners' strikes of 1984-5, as well as the TV series Boys from the Blackstuff - a drama about unemployed men in Liverpool. He attended a Roman Catholic comprehensive and later studied English at Cambridge University. After graduating he wrote for trade magazines including Tank World, before getting work with then-Labour MP Tessa Jowell. In 2001 he was elected to what was then considered to be the safe Labour seat of Leigh in Greater Manchester (it turned Conservative in the last election). In his first speech to the House of Commons, Mr Burnham told MPs that his constituents had little confidence in Parliament and said his challenge was ""to restore people's faith in politics and show that Parliament does listen and deliver good news as well as bad"". Five years after becoming an MP he was promoted by Tony Blair to the position of junior Home Office minister - a role which including going on a ""charm offensive"" tour to promote ID cards. In 2008, Gordon Brown made him culture secretary, and it was as culture secretary that he attended a memorial service for the 96 Liverpool football fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster. Andy Burnham at the High Court with other MPs and Hillsborough campaigners including Margaret Aspinall He later said he had ""agonised for weeks"" over whether he should attend the event because he knew ""he had nothing to say"" to the relatives seeking justice. His speech was interrupted by heckles from the crowd - angry that no-one had been prosecuted for the tragedy. This prompted him to raise the issue at cabinet and the Hillsborough Independent Panel was later established to investigate the disaster. Speaking at an event marking the 25th anniversary of the tragedy, he told the audience that the barracking he had received helped him ""find the political courage to do something"". In June 2009 he became health secretary and critics have accused him of increasing the role of private companies in the NHS. However, he argues, he used his time at the Department of Health to change policy by ensuring the NHS was always the preferred provider. Following Labour's defeat in the 2010 general election, Mr Burnham joined the race to succeed Mr Brown as party leader but lost out to Ed Miliband, coming fourth out of five candidates. He did better in 2015, coming second, beaten by Jeremy Corbyn. Reflecting on his defeat, he says he felt he was ""punished for loyalty"" to the Labour leadership, adding: ""Politics doesn't reward people who try and pull for the team."" Andy Burnham says he lost the 2015 Labour leadership election because Jeremy Corbyn offered ""a sense of renewal"" to Labour members He has previously described himself as ""tribal"". ""If anything defines me, it is being Labour,"" he has said. ""Whoever is the manager, I am part of the team."" However, more recently he told the New Statesman,externalhe felt ""semi-detached"" from the party. Some have accused him of moving with the prevailing wind and shifting from being a firm supporter of New Labour and Tony Blair when he first started out in politics to posing as the candidate of the left in the 2015 election. He says he gets ""frustrated"" by the flip-flop label, arguing that his politics are ""nuanced"". Looking back on New Labour, he says ""the early albums were very good"", but suggests it went wrong when ""it courted power and influence too much"". He served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, but stepped down to run for the mayoralty of Greater Manchester - a position he won in 2017 with 63% of the vote. Andy Burnham with his wife Marie-France Van Heel after winning the Greater Manchester mayoral election As mayor, he promised to donate 15% of his salary - currently Â£110,000 - to a mayor's homelessness fund and pledged to end rough sleeping by 2020. Last year he acknowledged that he may not meet the target but said he ""couldn't have done more"". He has vociferously defended devolution in England arguing that in the past ""places have felt powerless in the face of change."" Mr Burnham says that, apart from London, English cities ""aren't punching their weight"", adding: ""If we are going to make a success of Brexit, you have to set those cities free - and devolution could do that."" He insists that he is ""not about plotting a route back to Westminster"" and argues that he has more power now than he did as a cabinet minister. Asked in 2018 if he would rather score a hattrick for Everton or stand on the steps of Downing Street, he said: ""The hattrick for Everton dream has long gone, so has Downing Street - that ship has sailed. ""The dream for me is to play some part in the revival of the North of England."" But, whether he wanted to or not, Mr Burnham has very much returned to the centre of attention in UK politics in recent weeks, as he takes on the government over its plans to raise Covid restrictions on Greater Manchester's 2.8 million people to the highest level. He is demanding more money - as much as under the soon-to-end furlough scheme - to support those likely to unable to work as a result, including staff in pubs and bookmakers. Warning Westminster not to ""ignore"" his region, Mr Burnham said: ""If we go into a lockdown where we don't support people who are in the lowest-paid professions we will have a mental health crisis on top of a pandemic."" The stakes for Greater Manchester, and Mr Burnham's legacy, appear huge.

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances.

Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so.

But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot.

"This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Employees could face redundancy if the Treasury does not change its support for workers during Wales' firebreak lockdown, Wales' first minister has said. Furlough ends on 31 October, and a new scheme starts on 1 November, a week after the start of the firebreak. Mark Drakeford said he was concerned many laid off staff would not be eligible for what remains of furlough. The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had earlier accused the first minister of taking a decision that would mean people would lose jobs. On Monday, Mr Hart said the Welsh Government knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury to bring forward the Job Support Scheme before announcing the firebreak lockdown in Wales. He said the lockdown announcement in Wales was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"" before the Treasury scheme begins on 1 November. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Under the firebreak non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants will be forced to close from 18:00 BST on Friday to 9 November. On Monday Chancellor Rishi Sunak declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages - to be brought forward a month. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) expressed concerns about the impact on companies caused by the gap between the start of JSS, and the start of lockdown. The Welsh Government says the lockdown was necessary to avoid overwhelming the NHS. In a new letter to the Chancellor, Mr Drakeford said he was ""very concerned... that in the worst-affected sectors, leisure and hospitality, it is likely that many staff who will be laid off as a result of the necessary decision to close down all non-essential businesses from 23 October will not fulfil the eligibility criteria to be enrolled on the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) for its last week of operation. ""Employers with no income will be faced with the difficult decision of paying all of the wage costs of these employees or making them redundant."" The first minister has called for a relaxation in the old furlough scheme, which ends on 31 October, so it can cover all those paying tax through PAYE registered on or before 23 September. Currently only employees who were furloughed for three consecutive weeks can get help from the Treasury for the first week of the firebreak. The JSS plans to cover 67% of workers' wages in businesses that have been forced to close. It pays up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month and staff must be off for seven days to be eligible. Payments are due to begin in December. It replaces furlough, which ends on 31 October and covered 80% of pay, with government paying 60% and employers 20%. Some employees who are entitled to help through JSS may not be able to get help from furlough for the first week of lockdown - but it is not clear how many. Neither the Welsh Government or the HMRC were able to provide figures for how many people would be impacted. This lockdown means 20,000 pumpkin stock could be lost, says farm manager Damien Burnell The firebreak rules could mean losing 20,000 pumpkins - which is Â£80,000 revenue - for farm manager Damien Burnell at Penllyn Estate Farm in Cowbridge. ""We have got over 80,000 square metres of open space here and we can do this safely,"" he said. ""It is really going to impact our business quite hard."" Meanwhile the owner of Seven Clothing in Roath, Cardiff, Jaymin Patel, said he believed they too could operate safely. ""We have just all been pigeon-holed into one category and all just told to close,"" he said. Mr Patel added it is ""really difficult"" finding out about eligible support whilst running his business. This video can not be played Back in June there were fears for the future of the pub industry which were closed for months Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes have only beenallowed to serve customers indoors since restrictions were lifted on 3 August. Alistair Darby, CEO of brewery and pub chain Brains, which employs 1,400 people in Wales, said the pumps were being switched off again. Mr Darby told BBC Radio Wales more clarity was needed from the Welsh Government to stop businesses from trying to plug a wage gap, at a time no money was coming in. ""We have got to work out how to communicate to our staff what's going to happen to them, and what support they are going to get in three days,"" he said. ""It's an absolute dog's dinner. ""We've done everything that was asked of us to support the government in the fight of coronavirus... if they are going to shut us down again they need to do their bit and fast."" Boss Brewing owner Sarah John is worried there will be more firebreak lockdowns to come Sarah John, who owns of Boss Brewing in Swansea, said the firebreak would have an impact on their supply to pubs across Wales. But her worry was that the firebreak duration, ending on 9 November, would not be enough. ""My concern is what then? What if it doesn't have the desired affect? How many times can we continue to go back into lockdown?"" she said. Landlady Sarah Hudson says she feels ""alone"" after having to shut again weeks after reopening following flood damage The Bell at Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, was badly damaged after being flooded twice during storms in October and February. After being unable to get builders on site during the pandemic, the hotel only reopened on 4 September, and is now having to close again. Landlady Sarah Hudson said: ""We've only been open weeks, it's devastating. ""We were fully booked, we've had to cancel guests again... it's really upsetting, it really doesn't do much for our reputation as either flooded or shut down."" Ms Hudson said she was determined for the business to survive, but did not want to have to take out any more loans: ""I feel very much on my own."" Non-essential shops will have to close, as well as venues, gyms and beauty salons Ben Cottam of FSB Wales said issues with the Job Support Scheme was just one of the ways ""the firebreak lockdown will be causing serious disruption to businesses"". He said businesses that had not previously furloughed staff could not take advantage of wage support until 1 November, and there was an administrative issue in accessing two different schemes. ""We need UK government to take steps to make this process as straightforward as it possibly can be,"" he said. ""Thirdly, the amount of confusion surrounding this issue illustrates just how complex the situation looks to a small employer. There is no hard and fast word from UK and Welsh governments combined on this, and if you're a small employer trying to understand this situation, this will only cause more misunderstanding."" He said firms still needed clear guidance on who is required to close, and what is required of those firms that are still allowed to trade in some capacity. CBI Wales director Ian Price said: ""It appears that some people may unfortunately being falling through the cracks of the JRS and JSS. ""It's imperative for business, government and employees that we make this work."" Gyms will have to close again, only months after they reopened for members The Treasury has denied there is a gap between the two schemes. A spokesman said: ""We've given the Welsh Government an additional Â£4.4bn to cope with the pressures of the pandemic and we have protected more than half a million jobs in Wales through our income support schemes. ""Our support will continue over the winter months, with employers able to use the furlough scheme until the end of October and the Job Support Scheme from November 1."" Economy Minister Ken Skates told a press conference that while there may be no time gap between JRS and JSS, he claimed ""in terms of the generosity of his two schemes there is most certainly a gap"". He added that the Welsh Government was unable to make direct payments to workers itself to make up the gap, because it did not have access to people's tax records. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""question of fairness"". Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said: ""A firebreak gives us the opportunity to buy more time to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system. ""But for that to work, the UK government must also do its part by giving appropriate financial support."" A UK government source said the chancellor called all finance ministers before the announcement of the expansion of the scheme to explain how it would work, when it would come into effect and that it would be UK-wide. He asked finance ministers to keep restrictions as consistent as possible across the devolved nations, the source said. The Welsh Government said an extra Â£150m was being added to the Â£140m Economic Resilience Fund to support firms through the firebreak. It will include: Payments of Â£1,000 for businesses that are eligible for Small Business Rates relief and occupy a property with a rateable value of Â£12,000 or less Payments of up to Â£5,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that are required to close and which occupy a property with a rateable value of between Â£12,001 and Â£50,000 A Â£2,000 ""top-up grant"" for businesses closed or materially affected by lockdown A Â£1,000 grant for businesses that were materially affected by local lockdown measures for 21 days or more prior to the start of the firebreak Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown?

"Visa and Mastercard have been accused of cashing in during the coronavirus crisis by charging ""excessive fees"". The British Retail Consortium says the fees charged by payment firms have almost doubled in the last two years. They warn that retailers will be forced to pass on the extra costs to consumers, with credit card bills rising by another Â£40 a year. However, Mastercard questioned the BRC's findings and said shops were paying less than five years ago. The BRC's head of finance policy, Andrew Cregan, told the BBC: ""It is vital that the government takes action to tackle excessive card costs,"" said the BRC's Andrew Cregan. ""If a phone or energy company increased their fees by such an amount there would uproar. ""It's an abuse of a dominant market position by these companies. They're two of the most profitable organisations in the world and they've got merchants over a barrel."" More than half of all payments made by card even before coronavirus Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Coronavirus: Credit card spending fell 50% at start of lockdown The industry body wants the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate the card schemes. A Visa spokesperson responded: ""Visa enables millions of merchants throughout the UK to access the benefits of digital payments, giving them the ability to reach billions of potential customers both in their local communities and across the globe. Visa has delivered to UK consumers some of the most secure and innovative payments solutions available anywhere in the world."" A Mastercard spokesperson said: ""We do not believe the BRC's report represents the facts of the UK payments industry. ""The UK benefits from a highly competitive payments system designed for ease, simplicity and security for all those who make or receive a payment. ""Digital payments are the most effective way of receiving and making payments for business and by their nature are significantly less costly than cash."" Mastercard added that, on average, BRC members ""pay less to accept a like-for-like Mastercard transaction than they did five years ago"". Retail and hospitality trade bodies have come together to call for action to tackle card fees, as more of them have been forced to accept only card payments due to the pandemic and social distancing rules. Many retailers now only accept card payments, but they feel penalised by payment processers In its latest Payments Survey, the BRC said that card schemes were clearly the ""least competitive layer of the card payments ecosystem"", with a duopoly controlling 98% of the UK market. ""Complex billing structures have become a powerful tool to bamboozle political, regulatory or legal attempts to rein in increasing abuses of the schemes' dominant market positions,"" said the industry body. BRC said the increases in scheme fees - 39% in 2017 and 56% in 2018, measured as a percentage of turnover - were ""clear demonstrations of an abuse of market dominance"". The BRC said the average cost of a cash transaction to retailers was just 1.42p. Accepting payment by debit cards costs retailers 5.88p, while credit cards cost them 18.4p. ""The events of the last few months have accelerated a move towards the use of card payments across hospitality, with many now not accepting cash on safety grounds,"" pointed out David Sheen, public affairs director at UK Hospitality. ""The sector needs to be protected from excessive fees for doing the right thing."" Jeff Moody, commercial director, British Independent Retailers Association, said that local shops are being penalised as they are not able to negotiate better fees with payment firms. ""The contracts available to large national chains are often not available to individual smaller independent retailers,"" he said. ""With card transactions now the majority of their payment transactions, these costs are therefore being felt by consumers."" ""The costs that accompany acceptance of card payments represent yet another overhead for embattled small retailers,"" added Martin McTague, national policy and advocacy vice chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).

"The couple were seen posing on tracks in Whitby in July, accompanied by wedding guests A couple who posed for wedding photographs on railway tracks in North Yorkshire have been condemned by Network Rail. They were caught on CCTV standing on a line near Whitby in July. More than 5,000 trespassing incidents were recorded between June and September, with many involving people using the railways as a backdrop for photos. Network Rail said taking selfies and photo shoots was ""plain stupidity"". In September alone some 1,239 incidents were recorded - a 17% rise. Network Rail shared an image of a photo shoot on a train line in Cilfrew, Neath Port Talbot Supt Alison Evans, of British Transport Police, said: ""The railway is not an appropriate or safe setting for a photographic backdrop, no matter how scenic the setting. ""Every time someone strays on to the rail network they are not only putting themselves at risk of serious, life-threatening injury, but also delaying essential journeys."" More stories from Yorkshire People posing for photos on rail lines criticised Hollyoaks actor Ellis Hollins was forced to apologise in July after posting images on social media from a photoshoot on the railway. He admitted it was ""irresponsible"" and he was ""careless to take part in such a dangerous situation"". Another image showed people walking down a railway track in Harlech in Gwynedd Network Rail has launched a ""You vs Train"" campaign in partnership with British Transport Police to highlight the issue of young people trespassing. The number of incidents involving children at 51 targeted locations has fallen in each of the past two years. Allan Spence, of Network Rail, said: ""Wedding photos or selfies on the track are just plain stupidity.

"Talks between Greater Manchester and the government on the region entering tier three restrictions have concluded without an agreement, the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick accused Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham of being ""unwilling"" to take the action needed to control the virus. Tier three measures are expected to be imposed on the region as a result. Local leaders had been arguing for at least Â£65m in financial support. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later, while Health Secretary Matt Hancock will give a Commons statement at 19:00 BST. Mr Jenrick said: ""I'm disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of the situation, the mayor has been unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the government. ""I have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement."" The ""very high"" alert level - also known as tier three - would mean closing pubs and bars which do not serve meals, and additional restrictions on households mixing. So far, only theLiverpool City RegionandLancashirehave been moved into tier three. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood the government was willing to offer Â£60m but local leaders wanted Â£65m. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Who is Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham? The government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - have been embroiled in 10 days of talks over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8m population from tier two to the highest restrictions. The region has been under local restrictions since July. Local leaders in Greater Manchester had been calling for greater financial support to help those who would be affected by tier three restrictions. Currently,the new Job Support Schemecovers 67% of the wages - covered by employers and the government - of people affected by tier three closures, as opposed to the 80% offered during the UK's first lockdown. Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it is fair to recognise that if you put a place under restrictions for as long as we've been under restrictions it grinds people down. It pushes businesses closer to the brink."" But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Commons that Greater Manchester was ""being treated exactly the same as every part of our United Kingdom"". The chancellor reiterated that there was a ""national funding formula"" of Â£8 per head for all local authorities entering tier three. Business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Today Â£22m had been offered to Greater Manchester - equivalent to Â£8 per person - and there would be ""additional support commensurate with what we have done in Liverpool City Region and in Lancashire"". Sir Graham Brady, the Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, earlier said he believed a deal would be reached. Sir Graham, who is also chair of the powerful 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, said he thought would be ""very unfortunate"" if restrictions were imposed on the region. Earlier, BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said local leaders had been asking for Â£75m. The figure included the Â£22m given to areas that go into tier three, as well as the extra business support that was negotiated by Lancashire and the Liverpool City regions when they moved into top restrictions. Both regions received Â£30m in business support. This support scaled up to the larger Greater Manchester population would equate to about Â£56m. Mr Johnson will hold the press conference at 17:00 BST with Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, and Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England. Earlier, Mr Burnham said he would not ""break the law"" if no agreement was reached between both sides and the government imposed tier three measures on Greater Manchester. ""It's their prerogative to do what they think is needed,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But I would say to them that I don't think it will help us bring people with what they want to do to control this virus. I think it would be better to come to an agreement."" It comes as the number of weekly registered coronavirus deaths in England and Wales rose by 438 and increased by a third in the space of seven days, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. The three-tier system of alertscame into force in England last weekin an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that discussions are planned for South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he planned to make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. In Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. On Monday,government figures,externalshowed the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths.

"Scientists around the globe are working on potential vaccines for coronavirus The UK is pushing ahead to be the first nation to carry out ""human challenge"" studies where up to 90 healthy people will be deliberately exposed to Covid. The trials, which could begin in January, aim to speed up the race to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The government is putting Â£33.6m towards the groundbreaking work. Safety will be a number one priority, experts insist. The plans will need ethical approval and sign-off from regulators before they can go ahead. Human challenge studies provide a faster way to test vaccines because you don't have to wait for people to be exposed to an illness naturally. Researchers would first use controlled doses of the pandemic virus to discover what is the smallest amount that can cause Covid infection in volunteers aged 18 to 30. These human guinea pigs, who will be infected with the virus through the nose and monitored around the clock, have the lowest risk of harm due to their young age and good health. Next, scientists could test if a Covid vaccine prevents infection. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? This video can not be played What are human challenge trials? Lead researcher for the project Dr Chris Chiu, from Imperial College London, said: ""My team has been safely running human challenge studies with other respiratory viruses for over 10 years. No study is completely risk free, but the Human Challenge Programme partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can."" Prof Peter Openshaw, co-investigator on the study and director of theHuman Challenge Consortium,external, said deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen was ""never undertaken lightly"". ""However, such studies are enormously informative. ""It is really vital that we move as fast as possible towards getting effective vaccines and other treatments for Covid-19."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? There are hundreds of Covid vaccines being developed around the world and several front-runners already in the final stages of testing, including one from Oxford University. While some of these could get results and start to be used before the new trial has chance to begin, researchers say the work will still be useful, particularly for head-to-head studies to compare which vaccines work best. Experts say we will probably need a few different vaccines, as well as effective treatments, to defeat Covid. They will also need to be tested in those at highest risk from Covid - the elderly and vulnerable. The first stage of the human challenge project will be delivered by a partnership between Imperial College London, the Royal Free Hospital's specialist and secure research unit in London and a company called hVIVO. After exposure to Covid, the young volunteers will need to stay in a biosecure facility until they are no longer infectious. They will be financially reimbursed for their time, and monitored for up to a year after taking part in the study to check for any side-effects. People can sign uphere,external. Purposely infecting someone with Covid does pose an ethical dilemma, especially since there is no treatment to cure patients, although there are ones that might make it less deadly. Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at Oxford University, said the trials were justified: ""In a pandemic, time is lives. So far, over a million people have died. ""There is a moral imperative to develop to a safe and effective vaccine - and to do so as quickly as possible. ""Given the stakes, it is unethical not to do challenge studies."" Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""We are doing everything we can to fight coronavirus, including backing our best and brightest scientists and researchers in their hunt for a safe and effective vaccine.""

"The couple were seen posing on tracks in Whitby in July, accompanied by wedding guests A couple who posed for wedding photographs on railway tracks in North Yorkshire have been condemned by Network Rail. They were caught on CCTV standing on a line near Whitby in July. More than 5,000 trespassing incidents were recorded between June and September, with many involving people using the railways as a backdrop for photos. Network Rail said taking selfies and photo shoots was ""plain stupidity"". In September alone some 1,239 incidents were recorded - a 17% rise. Network Rail shared an image of a photo shoot on a train line in Cilfrew, Neath Port Talbot Supt Alison Evans, of British Transport Police, said: ""The railway is not an appropriate or safe setting for a photographic backdrop, no matter how scenic the setting. ""Every time someone strays on to the rail network they are not only putting themselves at risk of serious, life-threatening injury, but also delaying essential journeys."" More stories from Yorkshire People posing for photos on rail lines criticised Hollyoaks actor Ellis Hollins was forced to apologise in July after posting images on social media from a photoshoot on the railway. He admitted it was ""irresponsible"" and he was ""careless to take part in such a dangerous situation"". Another image showed people walking down a railway track in Harlech in Gwynedd Network Rail has launched a ""You vs Train"" campaign in partnership with British Transport Police to highlight the issue of young people trespassing. The number of incidents involving children at 51 targeted locations has fallen in each of the past two years. Allan Spence, of Network Rail, said: ""Wedding photos or selfies on the track are just plain stupidity.

Already, a record 29 million ballots have been cast nationwide. So what were the big moments from today?  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

If you're sick of politics by this point, here's something else to turn your gaze towards: the prospect of an asteroid skirting by our planet the day before the election! It's a story fit for 2020, but no need to panic yet. The fridge-sized space rock isn't big enough to do any damage. ""It currently has a 0.41% chance of entering our planetâs atmosphere, but if it did, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size,"" according to Nasa. As astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson put it: ""If the World ends in 2020, it wonât be the fault of the Universe."" But wait, there's more asteroid-related news! Nasa's planning a daring probe ""high-five"" with the asteroid Bennu. At 510m-wide (that's larger than the Empire State Building), be glad the hunk of rock is some 330 million km away from Earth.

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"Greater Manchester to move to tier 3 - very high- alert level from 00:01 on Friday Measures imposed by government after collapse of talks to agree deal with local leaders Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls move ""brutal"" and asks Parliament to intervene Region to get Â£22m for testing and tracing but no funding agreed for business support But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says an offer of Â£60m is ""still on the table"" Number of UK deaths with Covid on the certificate up 38% in a week, ONS figures show Republic of Ireland moving to a new, very high, level of coronavirus restrictions France has reported more than 2,000 people in intensive care - the first time since May Edited by Martha Buckley We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Today's reporting of the pandemic was brought to you by: Francesca Gillett, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Marie Jackson, Emma Owen, Martha Buckley, John Hand, Paul Seddon and Mal Siret. Thanks for reading. The Duchess of Cambridge has officially launched her Hold Still photo exhibition, comprised of 100 images taken in lockdown. She and the Duke of Cambridge met specialist oncology pharmacist Joyce Duah, whose photo of her colleagues writing their names and smiley faces on their PPE aprons was one of those selected. Catherine told Joyce: ""It had such an impact - it captured the moment, it was a look behind the scenes."" The royal pair also travelled to Waterloo, south London, to view one of the 80 public exhibition sites across the country being used for the project over the next four weeks. All 100 portraits will feature in a special exhibition hosted by the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire from Friday. Apart from the drama surrounding the tier-three restrictions for Greater Manchester, here's what you might have missed if you're just catching up. Liverpool City Region was the first area of England to enter tier 3. Labour says it will force a Commons vote tomorrow on a ""one nation"" approach to support for regions facing additional restrictions. They have put down a motion calling on ministers to publish ""clear and fair"" national criteria for economic support. The motion adds that financial help should also be voted on by MPs. The vote is non-binding but is an attempt to put pressure on the government over the issue of how support is determined. Here's a reminder of the main developments surrounding Greater Manchester's Covid-19 restrictions: Melania Trump will not be joining the US president at a campaign rally later today ""out of an abundance of caution"" As a bitter row erupts in England over strict restrictions being imposed in Manchester, here is a round-up of some of the other key headlines from around the world: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson says he can't give Greater Manchester disproportionately more money than other tier three areas. Andy Burnham says that he won't accept a deal that will lead to increased levels of hardship and homelessness. But there are political risks on all sides here. Could Boris Johnson look like a Whitehall bean-counter who can't bring himself to stump up an extra Â£5m? Does Andy Burnham look like he's overplayed his part as ""King of the North""? (As some now call him). All the while, those living in Greater Manchester might wonder what on earth is actually going to happen on Friday, in terms of financial support, as new measures kick in. That surely is now the next deadline. And I suspect political leaders on all sides won't want to have to explain to people, on Friday morning, why they couldn't reach an agreement in time. Council leaders in West Yorkshire have issued a statement saying the region will remain in tier two for the moment. In a statement, they said national and local public health experts agreed there was ""not a case"" to move the region to tier three this week. The leaders however repeated their call foradditional support,externalfor the area to help it through the tier two restrictions. Andy Preston, independent mayor of Middlesbrough, speaking on  BBC Radio 4 earlier today said that the city risked being put into tier three on the basis of flawed data. He said: âThey donât have the local knowledge that we have so Iâm terrified to know that conversations are going [on] in No 10 about putting Middlesbrough into tier three with bad data and based inferences and still no conversations, so Iâm wholly dispirited.â He added: âWe need a lot of money. We are facing monstrous problems here and the government seems oblivious,"" he said. ""I need to be talking to ministers and explaining the number of free school meals kids here is ballooning and the job losses are just starting. ""Weâre hitting a catastrophe of poverty and deprivation and we need serious money and serious commitment from the government to deal with it.â Labour's shadow chancellor Jonathan Ashworth said people across Greater Manchester ""will be watching the news in disbelief"". He says they will be asking: ""Why was it right to cover 80% of wages in March and then now, in the run-up to Christmas, cover just two-thirds of their wages in October?"" ""How does he
expect families to the pay the bills, to pay the rent, to put food on the table
and pay for school lunches when a third of their income has been snatched away
literally over night?"" He adds: ""Now, I grew
up in Greater Manchester, my dad worked in casinos in Salford, my mum worked in
bars in Manchester. I know that across Manchester people will want to do the right thing but they won't be able to if a third of their
income is stripped away. ""Now the leaders
of Greater Manchester were prepared to compromise. They offered to settle
for Â£65m to support jobs and livelihoods. ""The
government insisted on Â£60m. But rather than finding Â£5m extra,
this prime minister pulled the plug on negotiations and then this afternoon took Â£38m
off the table. What a petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis.""  Politicians in Greater Manchester are concerned about the economic effect tighter restrictions will have on the region. Earlier, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young asked the prime minister how much money would be made available. This video can not be played Covid-19: PM says 'huge sums' are being invested to help local authorities House of CommonsParliament Matt Hancock tells MPs placing Greater Manchester into tier three was a ""difficult decision"" but needed because of the spread of the virus. The health secretary says a ""comprehensive package of support"" will help the region weather the ""tough"" restrictions. He says Greater Manchester will get Â£22m for contact tracing and testing but a deal for business support has not been done. He says the government's ""door is open"" to ""further discussions"" on this in the coming days, calling the government offer ""generous"". The poll means that clearly the majority are following the rules A quarter of people admit they are not following the government coronavirus rules, according to an opinion poll released this afternoon. But the survey suggests Britainâs overwhelming adherence to the rules has become stronger in the past month. Ipsos MORI found 73% of people questioned over the weekend had followed the rules âcompletelyâ or ânearly all the timeâ. Of the 27% who admitted breaking the rules four in 10 said they had broken social distancing guidelines. One in five said they had gone on prohibited visits to friends and family. Ipsos MORI chief executive Ben Page said: âIn the same way that the majority of the public has consistently supported overall lockdown measures, claimed compliance with virus control measures has actually risen with the second wave of the virus. âMost people remain far more concerned about the virus than the economy.â The firm interviewed 1,067 adults in Great Britain online between 16 and 19 October 16.

Doncaster is currently subject to tier two restrictions in line with the rest of South Yorkshire, but the infection rate in the town in the week ending 16 October was the lowest of the area's four metropolitan boroughs, at 277 cases per 100,000 people. The highest is in Sheffield, where latest figures show an infection rate of 377.7 cases per 100,000 people. Responding to a question on Twitter,externalabout what action she was taking to stop Doncaster being moved up a tier, Mayor Ros Jones said: ""I've been fighting off Doncaster going into tier three, but it may only be a matter of time. ""If we go to tier three then our residents and businesses will need urgent support. I will continue to push for Doncaster to be treated separately from other areas."" And ina video posted on YouTube on Monday,external, the director of public health for Sheffield, Greg Fell, said it was likely South Yorkshire would face more restrictions. ""It's difficult to call when that might be. We're currently in the high risk category, we may move to the very high-risk category,"" Mr Fell said. Earlier the government released today's figures showing the number of new cases and deaths,which you can read more about here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update the House of Commons on England's latest Covid restrictions shortly. MPs are sure to ask him about support for Greater Manchester, after the PM announced the region isset to enter tier 3. The company suggested that the expected fall in the global birth rate following lockdown could have a knock-on effect on its baby formula business next year Sales of Durex condoms jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer, says maker Reckitt Benckiser. The consumer goods giant said growth in its health arm of the business, which includes condoms and ""sexual wellbeing products"", rose 12.6% in the last three months. Sales of Dettol, Cillit Bang, and air fresheners also jumped, helped by workers improving their new home-office environment, Reckitt said. During the spring lockdownReckitt saw a sharp drop in demand for condomsas people had less sex. During the first UK lockdown, people who did not live in same household were not allowed to meet. The full story is here. Anthony Fauci is part of the White House coronavirus taskforce Strained relations between President Trump and the White House's coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci show no signs of easing. The two have been at loggerheads over the administration's handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, Fauci said it was no surprise Trump had caught coronavirus, and he has complained about being misquoted in election campaign material. Monday saw Trump hit back in a call with campaign staff, labelling  Fauci a ""disaster"". Now Fauci has referenced Mafia hit The Godfather to play down the row. Interviewed by a California radio station, he said: ""That other stuff, it's like in 'The Godfather': Nothing
personal, strictly business. As far as I'm concerned, I just
want to do my job and take care of the people of this country."" There are more than 8.2 million confirmed cases in the US, and more than 220,000 people have died with coronavirus.      Greater Manchester MPs have been reacting to the latest developments. Wigan MP and shadow foreign secretaryLisa Nandysaid: ""In 10 years in Parliament I've never seen anything like this. We were told Â£22m is for test and trace, not a single extra penny promised to help businesses and minimum-wage workers. The government appears to be waging war on the people of Greater Manchester. I grew up under Thatcher but I've honestly never seen anything like this."" Hazel Grove's Conservative MPWilliam Wraggsaid:""The sense of failure is overwhelming. I shall avoid political comment until I have heard Matt Hancock's statement in the House of Commons this evening. Leadership is required from everybody. Trust is placed in us all and that is the privilege of public office."" Another Conservative,Chris Green, who represents Bolton West, wrote on Facebook: ""The government believes that three weeks of closing pubs and soft-play centres will make a dramatic difference. It hasn't and it won't. I think the health and economic impact will be damaging to our community but we have to do all we can to respect these rules since they have been imposed."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The PMâs confirmation that the Greater Manchester area is
to go into a tier-three shutdown of much of the hospitality sector at the end of
Thursday will be damaging to the local economy but the virus is still
spreading rapidly. The surprising thing here was that Â£60m of support to
businesses placed on the table in negotiations with Manchester at midday appears to have been completely withdrawn. The region was trying to establish
how much would be needed to fund support for businesses affected. At the press
conference, just Â£22m was mentioned, which works out at Â£7.85 per Greater Manchester
citizen - about half what Liverpool received. Local MPs and politicians said
Manchester was being âpunishedâ. The problem for the government here is that it is trying
to do two things at once. It is trying to accommodate the fact that some jobs
are gone forever and those people, it believes, should get new ones. That was
the rationale behind closing the furlough scheme. But since then the health
crisis has returned with a vengeance, and businesses are being obliged to be
shut, as more were in March. Mr Burnham says when London was driving
national infection levels high, the whole nation was shut down, and a Â£5bn a
month furlough scheme was launched. Now the north is leading infections, only
its city regions are being compulsorily shut, and the jobs support is
significantly less generous. During the negotiations, it is said that Greater
Manchester was told there was no longer the money. The government is trying to
balance lives, livelihoods and the limits of public spending on a regional
basis for economic reasons. But it is far from certain that a national lockdown
will be avoided. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9992042

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"Passengers flying from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Tuesday will be the first to have the option of paying for a rapid Covid test before checking in. The test will cost Â£80 and the result is guaranteed within an hour. The aim is to help people travelling to destinations where proof of a negative result is required on arrival. Collinson, the company behind the initiative had hoped the test could be used to enter Italy, but talks with the Italian government are continuing. A growing number of countries have classified the UK as being ""at risk"", meaning travellers from the UK face more restrictions. The authorities in Hong Kong now require people to show they have a negative test result, taken within 72 hours of a flight from London. The rapid saliva swab, which is now available at Heathrow Terminals 2 and 5, is known as a Lamp (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification) test. Which countries can I visit without quarantining? Airlines and airports in fresh aid package plea British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific will now offer it to customers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the aviation trade body Airlines UK, said he would like the cost of the test to be lower. ""For business passengers Â£80 is probably quite competitive but we've certainly said to the government in terms of introducing a test on arrival in the UK anything from Â£50-Â£60 would be better,"" he said. A Lamp test is quicker than the PCR test, which is widely used in the NHS, because the sample does not need to be sent to a laboratory. Collinson, the company behind the initiative at Heathrow, admitted that the Lamp test is ""slightly less sensitive"" than the PCR test. However, the Lamp test is considered to be much better than another rapid option - the antigen test. Collinson's chief executive David Evans told the BBC that ""health screening"" was quickly becoming another stage of the airport experience. He said passengers would only have to turn up at the airport an hour earlier. And he maintained testing would help give people confidence to travel, because flights would be ""Covid-secure"". ""It starts to make travel easier again,"" he said. Collinson, which partners with Swissport, hopes testing will help open up routes between the UK and other countries. People arriving in Italy from the UK must now either prove they had a negative coronavirus test before departure, or take a test on arrival at an airport in Italy. However, the type of test offered at Heathrow is not sufficient for people travelling to some destinations, such as Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda. All those places currently require proof of a negative PCR test, which requires analysis in a laboratory. The hope is that more countries will change their rules and allow for other types of test, which could be administered on the spot at Heathrow. It is important to note that the new testing facility at Heathrow is not for passengers flying into the airport. That means it will not have any immediate impact on the UK's two-week travel quarantine for people arriving from ""at risk"" countries. Collinson set up a separate testing facility in arrivals at Heathrow over the summer. However, that facility has not been used by passengers, because the government has not given its backing to testing people on arrival. Ministers have promised that next month, they will give their formal approval to the idea of people paying for a test after a week of quarantine, to avoid the full two weeks. On Monday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the government was in talks with the US Department of Homeland Security about a different type of system, possibly involving ""multiple tests"". The government is looking at another system, under which people could take one test two or three days before they fly into the UK, and then another test when they arrive. That could make it possible for someone arriving in the UK from an ""at risk"" country to avoid quarantine altogether. However, Mr Shapps said he could not say when that type of system would be up and running, because it required international co-operation. How are travel rules being relaxed?

"The name change comes after years of debate in the Quebec town The small Canadian town of Asbestos that decided it needed a rebrand has done away with the name derived from its mining heritage. The Quebec town, home to some 7,000 people, voted for ""Val-des-Sources"" as its new moniker. The town was once the location of the world's largest asbestos mine. It was given the English name for the mineral - rather than the Frenchamiante- in the late 19th Century. But the town's council said the connotation hindered its ability to attract foreign investment, and announced last November that the hunt was on for a new name. The town, about 150 km (95 miles) east of Montreal, finally announced the winning title with some fanfare on Monday evening. It was picked after a lengthy consultation and a vote by town residents, including those as young as 14. About half the town residents eligible to cast ballots did so. Val-des-Sources won with just over 51% of the vote in the third round of voting. The name is ""above all, inspiring for the future"", Mayor Hugues Grimard said. Why the Canadian town of Asbestos wants a new name Other possibilities on the shortlist were L'Azur-des-Cantons, Jeffrey-sur-le-Lac, Larochelle, PhÃ©nix and Trois-Lacs, which came in second place. Asbestos won't be changing its town signs immediately, said Mr Grimard, who suggested it could be the end of the year before the formal, legal switch. ""It'll be a nice Christmas present,"" he said. The town of Asbestos thrived for over a century on the chrysotile asbestos manufactured at its open-pit mine. The mine suspended operations in 2011. Once considered a miracle mineral, asbestos was used in construction industries for strengthening cement, in insulation, roofing, fireproofing and sound absorption. But by the mid-20th Century, concerns about its use were growing as more and more studies linked asbestos to deadly illnesses. Breathing in asbestos fibres has been linked to cancer and other diseases. Global demand plummeted as countries around the world began banning asbestos. Canada was a latecomer, only banning its manufacture, import, use and export in 2018.

Already, a record 29 million ballots have been cast nationwide. So what were the big moments from today?  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Former President Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance for Biden, holding a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, and President Trump will hold yet another rally himself, this time in Gastonia, North Carolina.

If you're sick of politics by this point, here's something else to turn your gaze towards: the prospect of an asteroid skirting by our planet the day before the election! It's a story fit for 2020, but no need to panic yet. The fridge-sized space rock isn't big enough to do any damage. ""It currently has a 0.41% chance of entering our planetâs atmosphere, but if it did, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size,"" according to Nasa. As astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson put it: ""If the World ends in 2020, it wonât be the fault of the Universe."" But wait, there's more asteroid-related news!

Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is reportedly being considered for a Cabinet position in Joe Biden's administration Joe Biden's team is reportedly vetting a select group of Republicans for potential positions on the Democratic nominee's Cabinet. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have both been named as potential options for high-profile seats, according to Politico. Should he win, reaching across the aisle could help Biden make good on his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans. The downside? He could face criticism from the more progressive wing of his party that he is pandering to the political right. Bringing someone from the opposite party on board would actually be a return to tradition, as set by past presidents including Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - but not by Donald Trump. President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Joe Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2 trillion investment in green energy. Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25. Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also want to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. We have more on the candidates' plans here. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. Next up, Tom Yasko. Tom served with the US Army in Iraq as a combat medic, but went into medical retirement nearly 10 years ago with spinal cord injuries. He is a political centrist and California resident who currently lives in Oahu, Hawaii. He is voting by mail in California for the Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Why does this election matter to you? Aside from being politically independent (a conservatively liberal centrist), a former Silicon Valley tech executive and retired from active duty combat medic, I am also trying to recover from a spinal cord injury I received in 2013 while obtaining Veterans Affairs (VA) managed care in the community. In the current climate, Iâm not sure any of that actually matters as I have wrestled with the VA over my care and treatment and even have an ongoing legal matter with the civilian provider. But one thing I do know for sure: no one is siding with the science.Which is very, very frustratingâ¦ personally. Whatever happens November 3rd, I would like to see the US begin a return to some semblance of sanity. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? I donât think it does. I joined active duty Army at age of 30, which means, I think, that I already held substantive views and positions on an array of things prior to ever being on active duty. I support Biden because  Tomis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: When he is being vocal, 50 Cent, a rapper, is usually talking about being in ""da club"". But today, he had a different message. ""VOTE For TRUMP,"" 50, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of Joe Biden's tax plan, which suggested that top tax rates under the former vice-president would reach 62%. ""62% are you out of ya ******* mind,"" 50 Cent wrote. Would tax rates really climb that much under a President Biden? The BBC's Reality Check team did some digging: Joe Biden has pledged to only impose higher taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year - about 1.5% of the US population. Tax calculations are rarely straightforward buta Tax Policy Center study,externalbacks up the idea that most people won't be charged higher rates. It also estimates that the effective, or average, tax rate on the top 1% of earners would rise to 39%. Different taxes imposed by individual states could lead to variations in the figure. Assuming that 50 Cent's earnings are in the highest earning bracket, he could well be liable for a tax hike and could consider life as 30 Cent. Mariana SanchesBBC News Brasil Correspondent in Washington DC President Trump has a surprising group of fans - the deported. At the beginning of the
year, Waldir Pereira da Silva, 44, paid $25,000 to a human
trafficker to cross the Mexico-US border with his family. His plan was to reach
the state of North Carolina, where he was promised a job as a janitor for $20 an hour. In Brazil, he made that much per day. The dream ended hours
after Waldir, his wife, and their 14-year-old daughter set foot in El Paso, Texas. They were found by American agents and held in custody for 16
days, before being loaded onto the plane chartered by the Trump administration to
return them to Brazil. He recalls those as
harsh days. They were called criminals and terrorists by the agents. He says they were
not given enough food. But despite the experience, Waldir, now in Brazil, is
still a Trump enthusiast. ""I always liked him. He is a strict person, who
wants the right things well done. Each country has its policy and I have
nothing to disagree with. If Trump sends us back, then we go back. Trump is
cool, follows Biblical principles, improved the economy, and says everything he
thinks in a very direct manner."" Waldir shows some of
Trump's supporters prioritise other aspects of him over his immigration agenda:
Trump's toughness, his management of the economy, and his conservative position
on issues like abortion. If you read Portuguese, there's more on this story from BBC Brasilhere. Waldir's family Tuesday was the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin Early in-person voting began on Tuesday in Wisconsin. Queues formed and stickers reading ""I Voted Early"" were handed out in polling stations around the state. The practice, which varies from state-to-state, allows people to cast their vote days or even weeks in advance. It is hoped that it encourages more people to vote and reduces queues on election day itself. Queues formed at polling stations in Wisconsin Early voting will go on until 1 November in Wisconsin In New York state, early voting will begin on 24 October and run until 1 November. Posters for 'Vote or Die,' a campaign by musician Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) to encourage people to vote, are already adorning the streets. Last week, photos of long queues to vote were met with shockin some countries around the world.

Olivia, 20, from Chengdu, China, asks:If Biden wins, what kind of policies or strategies will he adopt over the relationship with China? Biden's pledge to repair relationships with US allies fits in with his plan to create an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Here's what our state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher says: There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.

As the key swing state of Florida embarks on day two of early voting, a photo of a local police officer shared by a Miami Democrat is causing a stir online. The Miami policeman was photographed wearing a pro-Trump mask while in uniform, prompting some to accuse him of voter intimidation and call for his firing. Wearing a political item on the job is against the Florida code for state employees. The Miami police department has responded to the photo, saying they're aware of the image and that such behaviour is ""unacceptable, a violation of departmental policy, and is being addressed immediately"".

Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative judge and long-time academic The Senate will vote on whetherAmy Coney Barrettshould become the newest Supreme Court Justice on 26 October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced. That's on Monday - just over a week before the presidential election (and coincidentally Hillary Clinton's birthday). Barrett is Donald Trump's pick for the court, following the death of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg last month. The Senate, which has a Republican majority, is expected to vote yes to the conservative judge taking a seat on the court. It would alter the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which decides on some of the most important political and cultural issues in the US, including abortion,healthcareand voting rights. Read our reporter Anthony Zurcher on what's at stake in the vote. Money is extremely important in US political races, and this year Democratic candidates in the Senate are beating their Republican rivals hands down,according to analysis by the Washington Post newspaper.,external Fundraising helps candidates buy advertising as well as pay for their campaigning. Twelve of 15 Democratic candidates in the positions that are open raised at least double their opponentsâ amount, eight raised triple, and six raised at least quadruple. Joe Biden is currently also raising more money than Donald Trump. He held a record-breaking $383m fundraising in September, meaning he is now outspending his rival. Today we're featuring members of our voter panel who are US military veterans. You met Rom yesterday. Today we're featuring his answers on why being a veteran impacts his vote. Rom served as a US Marine for seven years and now works in business development. After backing Trump in 2016, he is more enthusiastically supporting his re-election this year as a check on the ârampant liberalismâ of Democrats. Why does this election matter to you? As an avid historian, a follower of current events since I was very young, and a veteran, I have become quite startled at the lurch towards the left by one of the two major political parties in our country. There was a time not long ago when the differences between the two parties were not that great. Both parties, Republican and Democrat, were aligned on the same goals, albeit, their methods for achieving those goals is what differentiated them. However, there has never been such a great divergence in goals between the two parties, with one - Democrats - appearing to make a steep and staggering lurch towards the left and intent on altering the fundamental values that the United States was built upon, and which allowed it to become the world's leader and economic powerhouse. There's never been a time in our country's recent history when one major party has pushed so hard to turn the United States into a socialist-like country. How does your background as a veteran influence your vote? Service members are trained to put their lives on the line for their country. In order to be willing to die for your country, you have to believe in its core values. I believed in the core values of my country when I served for seven years in the US Marine Corps, just as I continue to believe in those core values today. Notwithstanding his caustic and unconventional demeanor and personality, there are three primary reasons I support Mr Trump:  Romis a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: Former President Barack Obama is showing up on the campaign trail for the first time on Wednesday. He'll hold a drive-in car rally in the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, to encourage voters to turn out for Joe Biden, his former vice-president. The race is tight in Pennsylvania (which is also Biden's home state), and it could determine the outcome of the election. Though Donald Trump won there narrowly in 2016, Biden is hoping to win back former Democrats this time around. Biden is thought to be spending the week preparing for the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, and is making few public appearances. Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Peters Tunde, 25, from Lagos, Nigeria, asks:What impact would Trump (or Biden) winning the election have on Africa? We asked our colleagueDickens Oleweon the Africa desk to break this down. Hereâs what he had to say: Despite Donald Trumpâs widely reported pejorative remarks about Africa, many on the continent have a fairly positive view of the US. A recent study by Afrobarometer found that Africans â in the 18 countries polled - preferred the US developmental model to that of China, the continentâs largest trading partner. Africans feel more cultural affinity with the US than China, mainly because of the language and the cultural influence of the African American community, and this perception doesnât swing much regardless of who occupies the White House. Under Trump, the US has been trying to drive a wedge between Africa and China, pushing the continent to pick a side. Biden or Trump, Africans want a close relationship with the US but donât want to be told who to be friends with. In fact, the continent is keen to see a complementary relationship between the two world powers which it sees as crucial in helping it achieve its developmental goals. But if Biden wins, then Africans hope that there would be transparency in US military operations on the continent, and the reversal of policies that negatively affect Africans like a recent proposal by the Department of Homeland Security to limit students from several African countries to two years of study. Rafael RojasBBC Monitoring In-person voting has begun in Florida In the crucial electoral swing state of Florida, both US presidential candidates have increased their efforts to gain the support of the 280,000 Colombian-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. The Trump campaign in Florida is borrowing some of the language that Colombian right-wing leaders have traditionally used to discredit the left. This includes Trump backers using the expression ""Castro-Chavistas""- referring to followers of the late Cuban and Venezuelan leftist leaders Fidel Castro and Hugo ChÃ¡vez - seeking to characterise their Democratic party rivals as extreme left-wing radicals. On 23 September, Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo reported that some Colombian lawmakers from the ruling right-wing CD party of President Ivan Duque were openly supporting Trump in political events with Colombian-American voters in Florida. Trump's Republican campaign has warned that a victory for Joe Biden would lead to a change in US foreign policy towards Colombia, which has been a major recipient of US security aid.  Trump said Biden was ""weak on Socialism and [would] betray Colombia"". Countering this, Biden has made a point of highlighting the ""bipartisan nature"" of US-Colombia ties and his ""20-year"" relationship with the South American nation. In a 10 October opinion piece published by Colombia's El Tiempo, Biden wrote: ""Rebuilding our alliance with Colombia will be one of my priorities."" File photo of Trump walking to the Rose Garden President Trump is getting ready to record his own town hall event at the White House, scheduled to start in 10 minutes or so. He'll be joined in the Rose Garden by Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, to respond to questions from Bolling as well as members of the audience. But you won't get to see the president's Q&A session until it airs tomorrow night at 20:00 local time: a day before he faces off against Joe Biden in the final presidential debate of the season. It comes as the president and his campaign have complained about the quality of moderators selected by the presidential debate commission, accusing them of bias against him. A Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter in Maryland has been charged after he allegedly fired his gun when Trump supporters drove past his house, according to US media. No-one was hurt in the incident. Douglas Kuhn was putting up a BLM sign in his yard when his neighbours, who have Trump signs in their garden, honked their horn at him. The incident happened on Saturday in Kingsville, close to the city of Baltimore. ""He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right atâ¦ and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,"" the neighbour, Neil Houk, told CBS Baltimore. A different neighbour said he had heard a single shot. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge.

"Boris Johnson decided to walk away from negotiations last Friday After months of wrangling and shadow-boxing, posturing and incomprehension of the bottom-line priorities of the other side - are the negotiations truly over? Political Twitter is exploding with theories: that Prime Minister Boris Johnson never really wanted a deal in the first place, that the EU threw away its chances to make a deal with missteps at last week's summit, or that the UK is overplaying its hand - expecting the EU to ""cave in at 10 to midnight"" in negotiations... Certainly, the last 24 hours have not played out as many a seasoned observer of this by now very, very, very long Brexit process might have imagined. Unlike Mr Johnson's decision on Friday to walk away from negotiations. That was half-predicted, following the EU leaders' summit. Seven things that will change on 1 January Key Brexit moments from 2020 Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? The prime minister had set the summit as a deadline (the EU regarded it as an artificial one) by which time a trade deal should be on the table. If not, Mr Johnson had said, he thought there wouldn't be an EU-UK trade deal and ""we should move on"". No-one I spoke to in EU circles in the lead-up to the summit took that ultimatum too seriously. Instead they reeled off examples of promises and deadlines the prime minister had made and set and ultimately ignored in the past: walking away from negotiations this June if sufficient progress hadn't been made, dying in a ditch last year rather than extend Brexit divorce talks and more. This video can not be played Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal? But I detected a slight unease in Brussels too. ""You never know with Boris Johnson. Might he do something radical? Something unexpected? I mean just look at the Internal Market Bill!"" mused one Brussels contact on the eve of the summit. The government's Internal Market Bill published last month has provisions (the cabinet call them a safety net) to override parts of the divorce agreement pertaining to Northern Ireland - which was agreed and signed off by the EU and Mr Johnson last year. The EU was taken aback by the bill and started legal proceedings. Yet on Friday, when the prime minister insisted there was no point carrying on with negotiations unless the EU fundamentally changed its position, there was a widespread assumption in Brussels and in parts of the UK that this was political posturing. Yes, the government had clear frustrations with the EU in its approach to talks. Yes, the EU was impatient with the UK because of a range of issues that came up in negotiations. But - the theory went - the end stage of negotiations would naturally be when both sides would publicly flex their muscles most of all. To show domestic audiences back home that they would fight their corner to the end... just before they agreed a compromise deal behind closed doors in the coming weeks. We saw France's Emmanuel Macron sweep into the EU summit last week sounding intentionally hardline about fish. EU leaders' written summit conclusions pointedly put the onus on the UK to make the compromises necessary to make a deal. And the prime minister responded that the EU had effectively ended negotiations, unless it changed its position. Most commentators assumed talks would resume late this week after some diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing. Mr Barnier has long been pushing EU coastal member states to allow him to start discussing compromises on fish And bang on cue on Monday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier offered to intensify talks (a big UK complaint has been that the EU hasn't complied with a promise to truly speed up talks this autumn). He also spoke about getting to work on ""legal texts"". Again, this was an overture to the UK, which has long grumbled that Brussels refused to start work on a joint legal text, despite the majority of the EU-UK deal already being agreed. What is the Brexit transition period? But instead of welcoming these moves - while maybe playing coy or hard-to-get till the end of the week (as it might have felt it too soon to ""give in"" after declaring talks over, such a short time ago) - Number Ten responded that, although welcome, the EU offer was insufficient. Again came the demand for a ""fundamental change of approach from the EU"". This is far tougher to come back from than the bilateral fist-waving last week. The EU has already made its overtures. It's unlikely to go much further unilaterally. Depending, of course, what the UK means by ""fundamental change of approach"". If what the government is after is the EU dropping its insistence on agreed competition rules, or at least common ""principles"" aka the level playing field, then Downing Street must know that's not going to happen - and negotiations are indeed over. The UK says it no longer wants to be tied to ""Brussels' rules"" but it's not unusual to agree competition regulations with trade partners. The UK has a state aid agreement in its post-Brexit trade deal with Japan. It's asking for level playing field provisions in a future deal with the US. If pushed, the EU may well further water down its demand for what it calls ""fair competition"" rules - if, for example, it feels there is a robust dispute mechanism in place in the trade deal, that allows either side to take swift legal action, if they believe the other has broken their agreement. Brussels has already budged on some of its competition demands, by the way, but it will never drop the ask altogether. Protecting the single market is more important to the EU (and for German car manufacturers, as they've told us) than a trade deal with the UK. And the EU does feel it must protect its market and businesses from potential ""unfair competition"" from post-Brexit UK. But, if what the government wants is the EU admitting that it, too, must make compromises to reach a deal, not the UK alone, in order to return to the negotiating table, then that is certainly doable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said as much last week. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who has in the past also spoken of bilateral compromise, could call Boris Johnson over the coming days. Mr Barnier has long been pushing coastal member states to allow him to start discussing compromises on fish. Months ago, he openly admitted that the EU's demand to keep pretty much the same fishing quotas in UK waters after Brexit as before was a ""maximalist position"". The EU's negotiating team was keenly aware that it would be easier for Downing Street to discuss compromises on competition regulations - which are far more important to the EU as a whole than fish - after it became clear Brussels would give way on fishing quotas. But coastal nations like Spain and the Netherlands - and especially France - insisted that they'd only start talking about quota compromises once the UK ""seriously engaged"" in discussions on the level playing field. Most importantly, those countries wanted to be seen by the fishermen and fisherwomen at home to have been fighting hard for their industry in trade negotiations with the UK. That they would have to compromise in the end is an open EU secret. Bets are now on amongst Brexit commentators over whether EU-UK talks will resume, come the end of the week, or next week at the latest, or whether we're indeed heading for no-deal. In the knowledge that, as economically significant neighbours and trading partners, the EU and UK will end up back around a negotiating table at some point, whatever happens next.

"Taff Street in Pontypridd was left under water during Storm Dennis after the river breached its banks A ""conversation"" is needed on how flood risk is managed as the Welsh Government ""cannot stop all flooding"", the environment minister has said. Its new 10-year flooding and coastal erosion strategy includes an online map so residents can check their risk. It is hoped it will encourage people to think about changes to their properties to reduce the impact of any flooding. This could include moving sockets higher up walls or investing in stone or wooden floors instead of carpet. One in eight Welsh homes - around 245,000 properties - is at risk of flooding, and a further 400 homes could be lost to coastal erosion. Flooding: Calls to stop building homes on flood plains Climate change 'puts Welsh historic environments at risk' What is climate change doing to Wales? Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said she wanted everyone to be clear about how they could ""play their part"". It follows the worst flooding Wales has seen in over 40 years when StormsCiaraandDennishit earlier this year. Roads were also flooded in Llanrwst, Conwy county, during Storm Ciara in February The Welsh Government said it was investing ""record"" amounts in flood prevention - between 2016 and 2021 it spent a total of Â£390m, reducing the risk for more than 45,000 properties. The strategy plans for better communication of the threat posed in future. The online map will be updated every six months and it will also show how flood defences are working. The aim is to bring down the cost of residents' insurance and provide ""peace of mind"" to affected communities. The Welsh Government wants people to sign up to phone alert services, such as the flood alert one run by Natural Resources Wales, and talk with neighbours to create emergency action plans. It also said it had made it easier for local authorities to access grant funding for flood defence work and had introduced a new Â£2m natural flood management programme. This will see projects such as planting trees and shrubs to slow the flow of surface water into rivers and drains after heavy rain. Beddgelert in Gwynedd suffered major flooding during Storm Francis during August this year, after a tree blocked the waterway under a bridge on the river Colwyn. As a result the water came over the bridge, which split in two and resulted in parts of the village being flooded. Alun Hughes, who owns the Tanronnen Hotel in Beddgelert, has not been able to open the hotel since it flooded. He is still waiting for his insurance to give the go ahead for works to start. Mr Hughes said the the way to stop future flooding was to clear debris from the river before heavy rain. ""There is a need to keep a close eye on the rivers and small streams in the mountains that are being filled with all kinds of debris, fallen trees etc,"" he said. ""Does anyone keep an eye on them? I don't think so."" Kevin and Zsuzsanna Kidner lost all their belongings from the ground floor of their house in February as river water flooded in Another victim of flooding this year was Sion Street in Pontypridd. It was one of those completely submerged after the River Taff breached its banks during Storm Dennis in February. Kevin and Zsuzsanna Kidner lost all their belongings from the ground floor of their house, with 4ft (1.2m) of water in the living room. It has taken seven months to renovate the house, with the decorators finishing just last week. The Kidners spent part of the year cooking on camp stoves in the garden ""It's been really hard - a nightmare,"" Mrs Kidner said. ""It's so nice to be able to sit and watch TV again and wash the dishes in the kitchen.  I'd been using the bathroom sink and we were even cooking on camping stoves in the garden."" As well as being flooded directly from the river, Mr Kidner said the water ""filled the drains and came up at the back of the house as well"". He thinks the drains need to be cleaned more regularly and wants regular inspections to check culverts are not blocked. ""There was a water pump in the street that never worked,"" Mrs Kidner claimed. ""These things should be trialled regularly - [like] a fire drill."" Sion Street sits right next to the River Taff and bore the brunt of flooding in February The street during Storm Dennis A short walk along the river at music venue Clwb y Bont, which also flooded during the storm, chairman Geraint Day said they were applying for grant funding from the Welsh Government to try to protect the building against flooding in future. ""We're looking to see how we can make the club more flood-friendly if you like - and that if water does manage to get in that it doesn't have the same long-term effect,"" he said. ""We still have concerns though that nothing has changed so far in the way water flow is managed in Pontypridd. I don't see anything different in place now that there was in February."" A Rhondda Cynon Taf council spokesman said: ""The flooding to Pontypridd was from the River Taff and managing the risk of flooding from main river is the responsibility of Natural Resources Wales. ""Our main culverts are checked immediately prior to any storms, and they had no bearing on flooding at Sion Street or Clwb Y Bont. ""Natural Resources Wales will shortly publish its statutory report into these matters later this week."" The Welsh Conservatives branded the strategy a disappointment, claiming the Welsh Government's line on encouraging communities to be more resilient was insulting. Plaid Cymru also called for greater leadership in getting all those involved in tackling flooding together to discuss ways forward.

"Greater Manchester is currently in tier two, or ""high alert"" level Greater Manchester leaders have been given a deadline of midday to reach a deal with the government over moving to tier three Covid restrictions. If a deal is not reached, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the PM would decide on the next steps. In this situation, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the ""implication"" was the top tier of rules would be imposed. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the region was seeking a ""fair figure"" of support from the government. Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would be meeting with local leaders this morning and would advise them to set out the request in a letter to the government. The government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - have been embroiled in 10 days of talks over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8m population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Greater Manchester has been under local restrictions since July. The ""very high"" alert level - also known as tier three - would mean closing pubs and bars which do not serve meals, and additional restrictions on households mixing. Mr Jenrick said local leaders had been ""so far unwilling to take the action that is required to get this situation under control"". It come as the number of weekly registered coronavirus deaths in England and Wales rose by 438 and increased by a third in the space of seven days, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Who is Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham? Speaking to Today, Mr Burnham described the government's ""late-night ultimatum briefed to the media"" as a ""slightly provocative move"", but he said he was going to ""try and find a way forward"". He said local leaders had never been given a figure for additional financial support in return for further restrictions. As well as setting out what a ""fair figure"" of support was, Mr Burnham said he wanted ""full flexibility"" to support people who will be affected by restrictions. He said: ""I think it is fair to recognise that if you put a place under restrictions for as long as we've been under restrictions it grinds people down. It pushes businesses closer to the brink."" Mr Burnham has previously called for the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages (covered by employers and the government) of people affected by tier three closures. Business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Today Â£22m had been offered to Greater Manchester - equivalent to Â£8 per person - and there would be ""additional support commensurate with what we have done in Liverpool City Region and in Lancashire"". Mr Burnham said he would not ""break the law"" if no agreement was reached between both sides and the government imposed tier three measures on Greater Manchester. ""It's their prerogative to do what they think is needed,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But I would say to them that I don't think it will help us bring people with what they want to do to control this virus. I think it would be better to come to an agreement."" Mr Burnham also said he thought the shielding of elderly and vulnerable people in Greater Manchester needed to be ""looked at seriously"" and suggested it was ""part of the solution"". Sir Richard Leese, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, told BBC Newsnight he hoped a deal could still be made, but added: ""If government imposes tier three - and I hope that won't happen - we will clearly need to comply with that."" On Monday, Mr Burnham and Sir Richardaccused the government,externalof using ""selective statistics"" on hospital occupancy rates to bolster the case for tougher rules. On Monday evening, the two sides couldn't even agree on what they actually discussed earlier. Believe the local leaders and on Monday morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low-paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around Â£15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of co-operation, that meeting went south. Read more from Laura. A three-tier system of alerts was announced a week ago in an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. So far, only theLiverpool City RegionandLancashirehave been moved into tier three. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday that discussions are planned for South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he would make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. In Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. On Monday,government figures,externalshowed the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths.

"This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Employees could face redundancy if the Treasury does not change its support for workers during Wales' firebreak lockdown, Wales' first minister has said. Furlough ends on 31 October, and a new scheme starts on 1 November, a week after the start of the firebreak. Mark Drakeford said he was concerned many laid off staff would not be eligible for what remains of furlough. The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had earlier accused the first minister of taking a decision that would mean people would lose jobs. On Monday, Mr Hart said the Welsh Government knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury to bring forward the Job Support Scheme before announcing the firebreak lockdown in Wales. He said the lockdown announcement in Wales was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"" before the Treasury scheme begins on 1 November. Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? When would we know a circuit-breaker is working? Under the firebreak non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants will be forced to close from 18:00 BST on Friday to 9 November. On Monday Chancellor Rishi Sunak declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages - to be brought forward a month. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) expressed concerns about the impact on companies caused by the gap between the start of JSS, and the start of lockdown. The Welsh Government says the lockdown was necessary to avoid overwhelming the NHS. In a new letter to the Chancellor, Mr Drakeford said he was ""very concerned... that in the worst-affected sectors, leisure and hospitality, it is likely that many staff who will be laid off as a result of the necessary decision to close down all non-essential businesses from 23 October will not fulfil the eligibility criteria to be enrolled on the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) for its last week of operation. ""Employers with no income will be faced with the difficult decision of paying all of the wage costs of these employees or making them redundant."" The first minister has called for a relaxation in the old furlough scheme, which ends on 31 October, so it can cover all those paying tax through PAYE registered on or before 23 September. Currently only employees who were furloughed for three consecutive weeks can get help from the Treasury for the first week of the firebreak. The JSS plans to cover 67% of workers' wages in businesses that have been forced to close. It pays up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month and staff must be off for seven days to be eligible. Payments are due to begin in December. It replaces furlough, which ends on 31 October and covered 80% of pay, with government paying 60% and employers 20%. Some employees who are entitled to help through JSS may not be able to get help from furlough for the first week of lockdown - but it is not clear how many. Neither the Welsh Government or the HMRC were able to provide figures for how many people would be impacted. This lockdown means 20,000 pumpkin stock could be lost, says farm manager Damien Burnell The firebreak rules could mean losing 20,000 pumpkins - which is Â£80,000 revenue - for farm manager Damien Burnell at Penllyn Estate Farm in Cowbridge. ""We have got over 80,000 square metres of open space here and we can do this safely,"" he said. ""It is really going to impact our business quite hard."" Meanwhile the owner of Seven Clothing in Roath, Cardiff, Jaymin Patel, said he believed they too could operate safely. ""We have just all been pigeon-holed into one category and all just told to close,"" he said. Mr Patel added it is ""really difficult"" finding out about eligible support whilst running his business. This video can not be played Back in June there were fears for the future of the pub industry which were closed for months Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes have only beenallowed to serve customers indoors since restrictions were lifted on 3 August. Alistair Darby, CEO of brewery and pub chain Brains, which employs 1,400 people in Wales, said the pumps were being switched off again. Mr Darby told BBC Radio Wales more clarity was needed from the Welsh Government to stop businesses from trying to plug a wage gap, at a time no money was coming in. ""We have got to work out how to communicate to our staff what's going to happen to them, and what support they are going to get in three days,"" he said. ""It's an absolute dog's dinner. ""We've done everything that was asked of us to support the government in the fight of coronavirus... if they are going to shut us down again they need to do their bit and fast."" Boss Brewing owner Sarah John is worried there will be more firebreak lockdowns to come Sarah John, who owns of Boss Brewing in Swansea, said the firebreak would have an impact on their supply to pubs across Wales. But her worry was that the firebreak duration, ending on 9 November, would not be enough. ""My concern is what then? What if it doesn't have the desired affect? How many times can we continue to go back into lockdown?"" she said. Landlady Sarah Hudson says she feels ""alone"" after having to shut again weeks after reopening following flood damage The Bell at Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, was badly damaged after being flooded twice during storms in October and February. After being unable to get builders on site during the pandemic, the hotel only reopened on 4 September, and is now having to close again. Landlady Sarah Hudson said: ""We've only been open weeks, it's devastating. ""We were fully booked, we've had to cancel guests again... it's really upsetting, it really doesn't do much for our reputation as either flooded or shut down."" Ms Hudson said she was determined for the business to survive, but did not want to have to take out any more loans: ""I feel very much on my own."" Non-essential shops will have to close, as well as venues, gyms and beauty salons Ben Cottam of FSB Wales said issues with the Job Support Scheme was just one of the ways ""the firebreak lockdown will be causing serious disruption to businesses"". He said businesses that had not previously furloughed staff could not take advantage of wage support until 1 November, and there was an administrative issue in accessing two different schemes. ""We need UK government to take steps to make this process as straightforward as it possibly can be,"" he said. ""Thirdly, the amount of confusion surrounding this issue illustrates just how complex the situation looks to a small employer. There is no hard and fast word from UK and Welsh governments combined on this, and if you're a small employer trying to understand this situation, this will only cause more misunderstanding."" He said firms still needed clear guidance on who is required to close, and what is required of those firms that are still allowed to trade in some capacity. CBI Wales director Ian Price said: ""It appears that some people may unfortunately being falling through the cracks of the JRS and JSS. ""It's imperative for business, government and employees that we make this work."" Gyms will have to close again, only months after they reopened for members The Treasury has denied there is a gap between the two schemes. A spokesman said: ""We've given the Welsh Government an additional Â£4.4bn to cope with the pressures of the pandemic and we have protected more than half a million jobs in Wales through our income support schemes. ""Our support will continue over the winter months, with employers able to use the furlough scheme until the end of October and the Job Support Scheme from November 1."" Economy Minister Ken Skates told a press conference that while there may be no time gap between JRS and JSS, he claimed ""in terms of the generosity of his two schemes there is most certainly a gap"". He added that the Welsh Government was unable to make direct payments to workers itself to make up the gap, because it did not have access to people's tax records. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""question of fairness"". Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said: ""A firebreak gives us the opportunity to buy more time to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system. ""But for that to work, the UK government must also do its part by giving appropriate financial support."" A UK government source said the chancellor called all finance ministers before the announcement of the expansion of the scheme to explain how it would work, when it would come into effect and that it would be UK-wide. He asked finance ministers to keep restrictions as consistent as possible across the devolved nations, the source said. The Welsh Government said an extra Â£150m was being added to the Â£140m Economic Resilience Fund to support firms through the firebreak. It will include: Payments of Â£1,000 for businesses that are eligible for Small Business Rates relief and occupy a property with a rateable value of Â£12,000 or less Payments of up to Â£5,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that are required to close and which occupy a property with a rateable value of between Â£12,001 and Â£50,000 A Â£2,000 ""top-up grant"" for businesses closed or materially affected by lockdown A Â£1,000 grant for businesses that were materially affected by local lockdown measures for 21 days or more prior to the start of the firebreak Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown?

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Wales will go into a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown from Friday until 9 November. People will be told to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops must shut. Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under new ""firebreak"" rules. Gatherings indoors and outdoors with people not in your household will also be banned. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the ""time-limited firebreak"" would be ""a short, sharp, shock to turn back the clock, slow down the virus and buy us more time"". Without action the NHS would not be able to cope, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But a UK government schemethat will cover 67% of the wages of workers at firms forced to close, due to start on 1 November, will not be brought forward to cover the Welsh lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that was because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"", in a letter to the first minister. Some employees may be able to be re-furloughed, however. Under the lockdown leisure businesses, community centres, libraries and recycling centres will shut. Places of worship will be closed for normal services, except for funerals and weddings. The announcement follows rising case numbers in Wales and increasing hospital admissions and replaces the 17 local lockdowns that had been in place. Figures now stand at 128.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over seven days - there were 4,043 cases recorded between 10 and 16 October. Also of concern is the proportion of positive tests - just under 12% in Wales and nearly 19% in Cardiff, which also has the highest case rate over the past week, 226.6 cases per 100,000. What difference could a circuit-breaker make? Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Welsh pro sport to continue in 'firebreak' Halloween and Bonfire Night gatherings will not be allowed under the restrictions which begin at 18:00 BST on Friday, the start of the half-term holiday. But there will be an exception for small Remembrance Sunday commemoration services on 8 November. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Non-essential cross border travel in and out of Wales ""will have to end"" during the firebreak period, Mr Drakeford said. Universities in Wales will continue to provide ""a blend of in-person and online learning"". If students have reading weeks or half-term they will also need to stay at home in their university accommodation, the first minister said. The Welsh Government has provided a package of almost Â£300m to support businesses. Non-essential retail will be told to close for 17 days from Friday The rules will be similar to the lockdown in March: People will have to stay at home except for very limited reasons, such as exercise People must work from home where they can People must not visit other households or meet other people they do not live with either indoors and outdoors All non-food retail will shut, and cafes, restaurants and pubs will close unless they provide delivery or takeaways Hotels, hairdressers and beauticians will have to shut People breaching the rules could be fined, with fixed penalty notices starting at Â£60. Adults living alone or single parents will be able to join with one other household from anywhere in Wales for support. Existing rules on face masks - requiring them to be worn in public places indoors - will stay in place. The previous lockdown continued for months past its initial three weeks, but Mr Drakeford said the firebreak would end on 9 November. ""I've heard some people say, 'oh, the figures won't be down by the 9 of November, so the period will have to continue' - that is not the test to set,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said a national lockdown was needed ""partly because the gap between those parts of Wales where we have not needed local lockdowns, and local lockdown areas have been narrowing"". ""We all want to see an end to this pandemic and our lives returned to us. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a vaccine, which will allow us to do that. ""So this is our best chance of regaining control of the virus and avoiding a much-longer - and damaging - national lockdown."" The two weeks will be used ""very purposefully"", the first minister said, allowing for more staff to be recruited for contact tracing and allow others to ""catch up on the huge volume of contacts that have to be contacted and traced"" from recent weeks. He told BBC Wales the speed of the upsurge in cases had ""come earlier than the models suggested"". Local restrictions had worked, he said, but added: ""We have to go beyond them, not because they have failed, but because they haven't been able to succeed enough. TheTechnical Advisory Cell,external, which gives advice to the Welsh Government, recommended a two or three week ""hard firebreak"" to bring thereproduction numberbelow 1. The R number is the rate at which the virus is increasing - it currently stands between 1.1 and 1.4. Without a massive reduction in transmission, the scientific advisory body concludes the impact on the hospitals and intensive care units would be ""too high for the NHS to sustain"". Pubs and restaurants will have to shut, unless they offer takeaways A new Â£300m fund for firms affected will open next week. The Welsh Government said every firm covered by small business rates relief would receive a Â£1,000 payment. Small and medium-sized retail, leisure and hospitality firms that have to close will get a one-off payment of up to Â£5,000. There will be additional discretionary grants and support for smaller firms that are struggling, the government said. It added that firms would be able to access the support available under the new UK government Job Support Scheme,which will cover 67% of workers pay at businesses forced to shut, but that does not begin until 1 November. Mr Sunak, in a letter to Mr Drakeford, said he would be unable to bring the claims date forward for the JSS to 23 October. He said the previous Job Retention Scheme was in place until 31 October and employees previously furloughed for three weeks can be re-furloughed. Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said people would lose their jobs ""as a result of the first minister's decision"" and claimed there had been a discussion with the Treasury ""a while ago"". He added: ""Asking the Treasury to suddenly bring forward the scheme, the first minister knows full well that wasn't possible - because he was told by the chancellor several days ago. ""That strikes me as being very, very unfair on the people who will be caught by the time gap between the Welsh Government scheme and the Treasury scheme kicking in."" The Welsh Government said ministers had offered to pay the extra costs associated with early access to the Jobs Support Scheme. A spokesman said it meant firms would ""now have to access both the Job Retention Scheme and the Job Support Scheme at different points during the fire-break period"". ""It is absolutely crucial the UK government ensures this process is as smooth as possible and that all affected Welsh businesses and employees benefit from these schemes during this difficult time."" The union Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru said the Welsh Government's decision that primary school children and secondary school children in Years 7and 8 should return after half-term was ""a sensible balance in these circumstances"". A retail lobbyist said she was not aware of ""any evidence"" that justified the closure of non-essential shops. ""Retailers are now gearing up for the vital festive trading period when a fifth of goods are bought. If shops can't trade in the run-up to Christmas that will be a catastrophe,"" said Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium. This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Janine Brown, who owns of Crundles gift shop in Swansea, said: ""I'm obviously disappointedâ¦ I've just ordered all my Christmas stock in and I've got to pay for it this week and we're going to be shut down for another two weeks. ""We're all fed up of it, we're all really upset about it. What do we do as small businesses?"" The British Beer and Pub Association said the firebreak would ""destroy many pubs, brewers and their supply chains in the country unless the financial support package is available to all businesses hit by the forced closure of all pubs"". ""The financial support package announced today leaves many businesses impacted by this forced closure with no additional help,"" said chief executive Emma McClarkin. In August, the Welsh Government launched its 'Coronavirus Control Plan for Wales' outlining a strategy to ""avoid returning to a national lockdown"". So, two months later, as we prepare for another lockdown, has that plan and those lines of defence failed? The first minister talked in his press conference about using the two week firebreak ""very purposefully"" to strengthen the contact tracing system and accelerating the establishment of field hospitals. He also said they will be looking at the system of fines. Could we see people receiving fixed penalty notices for not self-isolating? There was no direct answer today. The speed at which tests are being processed is still a major issue. But most of Wales' tests and most of the problems are in the UK government's lighthouse labs so out of their control. But Mr Drakeford said it is ""quite likely"" that one crucial aspect is unlikely to have improved by the end of the firebreak period - the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations. Regardless, he ruled out an extension beyond 9 November but at the same time he did not rule out another firebreak lockdown in a few months' time. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a firebreak was a ""last resort"" and should only be used in an emergency. ""We are now in an emergency,"" he said. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative leader, accused the first minister of ""failing to be open and transparent about the evidence"". He added: ""The main concern is that this national lockdown is not proportionate. ""The impact on businesses in areas such as Powys, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, who have the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases in Wales, will be severe at a time when they are desperately struggling to recover from the pandemic so far this year.""

"Boris Johnson decided to walk away from negotiations last Friday After months of wrangling and shadow-boxing, posturing and incomprehension of the bottom-line priorities of the other side - are the negotiations truly over? Political Twitter is exploding with theories: that Prime Minister Boris Johnson never really wanted a deal in the first place, that the EU threw away its chances to make a deal with missteps at last week's summit, or that the UK is overplaying its hand - expecting the EU to ""cave in at 10 to midnight"" in negotiations... Certainly, the last 24 hours have not played out as many a seasoned observer of this by now very, very, very long Brexit process might have imagined. Unlike Mr Johnson's decision on Friday to walk away from negotiations. That was half-predicted, following the EU leaders' summit. Seven things that will change on 1 January Key Brexit moments from 2020 Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? The prime minister had set the summit as a deadline (the EU regarded it as an artificial one) by which time a trade deal should be on the table. If not, Mr Johnson had said, he thought there wouldn't be an EU-UK trade deal and ""we should move on"". No-one I spoke to in EU circles in the lead-up to the summit took that ultimatum too seriously. Instead they reeled off examples of promises and deadlines the prime minister had made and set and ultimately ignored in the past: walking away from negotiations this June if sufficient progress hadn't been made, dying in a ditch last year rather than extend Brexit divorce talks and more. This video can not be played Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal? But I detected a slight unease in Brussels too. ""You never know with Boris Johnson. Might he do something radical? Something unexpected? I mean just look at the Internal Market Bill!"" mused one Brussels contact on the eve of the summit. The government's Internal Market Bill published last month has provisions (the cabinet call them a safety net) to override parts of the divorce agreement pertaining to Northern Ireland - which was agreed and signed off by the EU and Mr Johnson last year. The EU was taken aback by the bill and started legal proceedings. Yet on Friday, when the prime minister insisted there was no point carrying on with negotiations unless the EU fundamentally changed its position, there was a widespread assumption in Brussels and in parts of the UK that this was political posturing. Yes, the government had clear frustrations with the EU in its approach to talks. Yes, the EU was impatient with the UK because of a range of issues that came up in negotiations. But - the theory went - the end stage of negotiations would naturally be when both sides would publicly flex their muscles most of all. To show domestic audiences back home that they would fight their corner to the end... just before they agreed a compromise deal behind closed doors in the coming weeks. We saw France's Emmanuel Macron sweep into the EU summit last week sounding intentionally hardline about fish. EU leaders' written summit conclusions pointedly put the onus on the UK to make the compromises necessary to make a deal. And the prime minister responded that the EU had effectively ended negotiations, unless it changed its position. Most commentators assumed talks would resume late this week after some diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing. Mr Barnier has long been pushing EU coastal member states to allow him to start discussing compromises on fish And bang on cue on Monday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier offered to intensify talks (a big UK complaint has been that the EU hasn't complied with a promise to truly speed up talks this autumn). He also spoke about getting to work on ""legal texts"". Again, this was an overture to the UK, which has long grumbled that Brussels refused to start work on a joint legal text, despite the majority of the EU-UK deal already being agreed. What is the Brexit transition period? But instead of welcoming these moves - while maybe playing coy or hard-to-get till the end of the week (as it might have felt it too soon to ""give in"" after declaring talks over, such a short time ago) - Number Ten responded that, although welcome, the EU offer was insufficient. Again came the demand for a ""fundamental change of approach from the EU"". This is far tougher to come back from than the bilateral fist-waving last week. The EU has already made its overtures. It's unlikely to go much further unilaterally. Depending, of course, what the UK means by ""fundamental change of approach"". If what the government is after is the EU dropping its insistence on agreed competition rules, or at least common ""principles"" aka the level playing field, then Downing Street must know that's not going to happen - and negotiations are indeed over. The UK says it no longer wants to be tied to ""Brussels' rules"" but it's not unusual to agree competition regulations with trade partners. The UK has a state aid agreement in its post-Brexit trade deal with Japan. It's asking for level playing field provisions in a future deal with the US. If pushed, the EU may well further water down its demand for what it calls ""fair competition"" rules - if, for example, it feels there is a robust dispute mechanism in place in the trade deal, that allows either side to take swift legal action, if they believe the other has broken their agreement. Brussels has already budged on some of its competition demands, by the way, but it will never drop the ask altogether. Protecting the single market is more important to the EU (and for German car manufacturers, as they've told us) than a trade deal with the UK. And the EU does feel it must protect its market and businesses from potential ""unfair competition"" from post-Brexit UK. But, if what the government wants is the EU admitting that it, too, must make compromises to reach a deal, not the UK alone, in order to return to the negotiating table, then that is certainly doable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said as much last week. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who has in the past also spoken of bilateral compromise, could call Boris Johnson over the coming days. Mr Barnier has long been pushing coastal member states to allow him to start discussing compromises on fish. Months ago, he openly admitted that the EU's demand to keep pretty much the same fishing quotas in UK waters after Brexit as before was a ""maximalist position"". The EU's negotiating team was keenly aware that it would be easier for Downing Street to discuss compromises on competition regulations - which are far more important to the EU as a whole than fish - after it became clear Brussels would give way on fishing quotas. But coastal nations like Spain and the Netherlands - and especially France - insisted that they'd only start talking about quota compromises once the UK ""seriously engaged"" in discussions on the level playing field. Most importantly, those countries wanted to be seen by the fishermen and fisherwomen at home to have been fighting hard for their industry in trade negotiations with the UK. That they would have to compromise in the end is an open EU secret. Bets are now on amongst Brexit commentators over whether EU-UK talks will resume, come the end of the week, or next week at the latest, or whether we're indeed heading for no-deal. In the knowledge that, as economically significant neighbours and trading partners, the EU and UK will end up back around a negotiating table at some point, whatever happens next.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: Not reaching a trade deal with the EU is an âoutcome for which we are increasingly well preparedâ. The EU has said it is willing to ""intensify"" talks on a trade deal with the UK this week to try to break the impasse between the two sides. Its negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was prepared to discuss all areas of disagreement, including fishing and competition, based on legal texts. Michael Gove said he welcomed the bloc's latest ""constructive"" step. Later, No 10 said there was ""no basis to resume talks"" unless there was a ""fundamental change"" from the EU. The UK has accused the EU of dragging its feet and failing to respect its sovereignty in the negotiations. In a Commons statement, Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said his ""door was not closed"" to further talks but the EU needed to change its position for the process to continue. After a call between Mr Barnier and the UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, Downing Street released a statement saying the EU needed to try to find an agreement ""between sovereign equals"". Anglican leaders issue Brexit bill warning Firms urged to get ready for new EU relationship On Friday, No 10 suggested formal negotiations were ""over"" as the EU was not serious about discussing the details of a free trade agreement similar to the one it has with Canada - the UK's preferred outcome. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January, when it leaves the single market and customs union, without a specific agreement. But following a video call with his UK counterpart Lord Frost on Monday, Mr Barnier said he was willing to accelerate the process in the coming days to try to bridge the gap between the two sides.

Mr Barnier suggested all subjects would be on the table and the discussions would be based on specific legal texts, which the UK has accused the EU of refusing to consider in recent weeks. In response, Lord Frost tweeted that the proposal to intensify work had been noted, and added: ""But the EU still needs to make a fundamental change in approach to the talks and make clear it has done so.""

Updating MPs on the state of the talks, Mr Gove said the EU's latest move was a positive one and suggested the UK would respond in kind. He said: ""Even while I have been at the despatch box, it has been reported that there has been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that. ""We need to make sure we work on the basis of the intensification they propose and I prefer to look forward in optimism rather than look back in anger."" He added: ""If there has been movement, and there seems to be movement, then no-one would welcome it more than me but what we can't have from the EU is the illusion of engagement without the reality of compromise."" Some senior Conservatives have urged the government to walk away from the talks, suggesting the EU is no longer negotiating in ""good faith"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the EU's ""refusal"" to engage in meaningful talks on trade in financial services and agricultural products was a breach of the terms of the withdrawal agreement governing the UK's exit. The government has said the UK will prosper whatever the outcome of the negotiations, as it will be able to exercise freedoms not available while being an EU member. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves calls on the government to be âhonestâ about the effect of the UK not reaching a trade deal with the EU. But business groups have warned the UK's fallback option of a so-called ""Australian-style"" arrangement - where UK-EU trade will default to World Trade Organization rules - would be disastrous as it would see tariffs on goods moving across the channel. With less than 75 days to go before the transition period ends on 31 December, the government has urgedbusiness to step up its preparationsfor the looming changes to trading rules. The PM will hold a meeting with industry groups on Tuesday to emphasise the need for action. Labour has said the government only has itself to blame for the current uncertainty, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves calling on ministers to be ""honest"" about the effect on the UK of not agreeing a trade deal. And former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the implications of failing to agree a future partnership would also be highly damaging for the UK's security. This video can not be played Brexit: Theresa May seems unimpressed with Michael Gove's plan Mrs May, who quit last year after Parliament rejected her withdrawal agreement three times, said the UK ""should not be resigned"" to the prospect of failing to agree a deal over law enforcement and information sharing. She warned that ""if the UK walks away with no deal, then our police and law enforcement agencies will no longer have the necessary access to databases in order to be able to continue to identify and catch criminals and potential terrorists in order to keep us safe"". In response, Mr Gove said ""significant progress"" had been made in terms of security co-operation but the EU could not make access to databases conditional on the UK accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
