"Ukraine's MiG-29s are not as advanced as some of Russia's fighters Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called the ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"". ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". It describes the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" as ""a collective image of pilots of the Air Force's 40th tactical aviation brigade, who defend the sky over the capital"", rather than a single man's combat record. For weeks, Ukrainians did not have a name to go with the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" - but that did not stop the story going viral on social media. It was used as a marketing brand bya Ukrainian model aircraft manufacturer,external, while Ukrainian Iryna Kostyrenko showed offa military badge,externalinspired by the legend. And the defence ministry tweeted a video celebrating Tarabalka's heroism. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Military experts told the BBC they doubted that one pilot could have downed as many as 40 Russian planes. Ukrainian military historian Mikhail Zhirohov described the Ghost of Kyiv story as ""propaganda for raising morale"". Speaking to the BBC from Chernihiv, he said that early on in the war the Russians dominated Ukrainian airspace, so a Ukrainian pilot ""could only shoot down two or three"". ""It's essential to have this propaganda, because our armed forces are smaller, and many think we can't be equal to them [the Russians]. We need this in wartime,"" he said. The fact that Ukrainian pilots are still denying Russia total mastery of the skies, flying inferior, older Russian-designed MiG-29s, inspired this modern legend. With all its military might, Russia has had more than two months to knock out Ukraine's air defences - and failed. The Ukrainian authorities fuelled the Ghost of Kyiv legend just days into the war. The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) showed a fighter pilot on the Telegram messaging service, with a caption calling the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" an ""angel"" for downing 10 Russian planes. But it did not name the ""angel"", and media reports later said the photo used was an old one. On 27 February Ukraine called the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" an ""angel"" for downing 10 Russian planes A Ukrainian military expert who requested anonymity told the BBC the Ghost of Kyiv story ""has helped to raise morale at a time when people need simple stories"". Ukraine's morale has also been boosted bythe Moskva story. First, Ukrainian border guards defied the Russian missile cruiser with a rude gesture, commemorated with a popular postage stamp. Then Ukraine allegedly sank it - the pride of Russia's Black Sea Fleet - with two Neptune missiles. Russia admitted there was a fire on board, and that the ship sank, but made no mention of a missile attack. Heroic fighter pilots have entered the national mythology of other countries too. The UK celebrates the brave Royal Air Force pilots who outwitted the mighty Nazi Luftwaffe in the 1940 Battle of Britain. Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear 'My city's being shelled, but mum wonât believe me' Tips on how to spot Ukraine fakes And Russia itself glorifies the sacrifices of its World War Two pilots, who were outgunned by the Germans. Some deliberately crashed into enemy planes after running out of bullets. Legends like the Ghost of Kyiv are not surprising when there are such contrasting figures given for Russian and Ukrainian losses: there is plenty of room for embellishment. On 30 April, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said that in the war so far Russia had lost 190 planes and 155 helicopters. But independent military analysts Oryx reckon the Russian losses to be 26 planes and 39 helicopters, as well as 48 drones (UAVs). Both Russia and Ukraine are very secretive about their own losses. Counting is difficult, because aircraft often crash in Russian-held territory, and some manage to land in Russia. Portable anti-aircraft missiles are a key part of defending the skies Experts agree that in most cases Russian aircraft were downed with surface-to-air missiles, especially man-portable air defence systems (Manpads). Justin Crump of the security consultancy Sybilline says the Ghost of Kyiv legend is important because in our social media age ""people need myths, heroes and legends, to provide cohesion and meaning"".

"This video can not be played WATCH: Menopause made me think I had a brain tumour or Alzheimer's - Davina McCall The crisis in hormone replacement therapy in the UK is ""ridiculous"" and has to be fixed immediately, TV presenter Davina McCall has said. McCall - who has campaigned to raise awareness of the menopause - said not getting HRT could be life-threatening. ""Why is it taking this long to sort this out?"" she said. The government's Kwasi Kwarteng - who was listening to McCall - said it was ""really good"" that women were talking openly about the menopause and HRT. Earlier this week,the government announced it was rationing suppliesso women would only be able to get three months' worth of certain HRT products at a time. It has also appointed a new HRT tsar to help solve the crisis. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' Women forced to black market for HRT Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, McCall recalled her own experience of the menopause, saying she felt like she was ""a mush"" when it hit and that she lost her ability to be organised, practical and good at multi-tasking. ""When somebody asked me if I was OK because I'd messed up on a TV programme, I said yes. And then when she shut the door and went away, I just burst into tears,"" she said. ""Because I thought, 'I'm not ok, I think I've got a brain tumour, or I've got Alzheimer's or something - help me'."" Asked about the so-called 'Davina effect' - the idea that demand for HRT increased after McCall raised awareness in a Channel 4 documentary last year - she said: ""I'm not going to feel bad about that. ""I get really kind of annoyed when people are like, 'well it's Davina's fault'. You know what, we are actually trying to help women sort out their hormones and live a normal, healthy life. ""There were shortages way before that documentary came out last year. Apparently there is a surplus of hormones in Europe. Why is it taking this long to sort this out?"" The 54-year-old - whose follow-up documentary on the menopause will air on Channel 4 on Monday - added: ""It's a medicine. If there was a shortage in insulin or another drug that women or men had to take, that would get sorted out immediately. ""It can be life-threatening not getting women's HRT. But yes, I do want to get more women on HRT as it would benefit the NHS in a huge way. This has to get sorted. It is ridiculous."" HRT is a treatment designed to relieve symptoms of the menopause. The shortage is thought to affect about a million women in the UK, with many left suffering from symptoms andsome even turning to the black market. It is not clear why there is currently a shortage in the UK, but some pharmaceutical companies have blamed it on increased demand. Prescriptions for HRT in England more than doubled since 2017. The Covid pandemic has also caused issues,the British Menopause Society has previously said.,external But HRT is not the only type of medicine that has been in short supply - witha survey showing supply chain problemsare a daily issue for a majority of pharmacies. Pharmacists have called for a simple law change that would allow them to make medicine swaps, saying it would help solve the HRT issue. The Department of Health and Social Care said demand for HRT had risen by 38% in the past seven years, as access had been extended, but most of the 70 products available in the UK remained in good supply. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng - who was a guest on BBC Two's Sunday Morning show straight after McCall - said: ""Even only five, 10 years ago there was a taboo about issues such as the menopause, hormone replacement therapy. ""And it's really good we live in a culture and a society where we can talk about these things more openly,"" he said. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I want to reassure women I have listened to their concerns and will not hesitate to take decisive action to ensure they can access the HRT they need. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our national mission to boost supply of HRT - and this next step will ensure women across the UK will be able to reliably access this vital medication and maintain this lifeline for millions who need it.""

"Food prices will keep rising, and stay higher ""for quite some time"" due to the high cost of raw materials, Asda chairman Lord Rose has said. Many families struggling with the cost of living crisis are ""going to suffer"", the Conservative peer warned - although retailers will try to keep costs down. The Bank of England expects price inflation to hit 8% this spring. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said inflation would not necessarily be long term. Families in the UK have been struggling as energy, fuel and food costs rise rapidly. Speaking to the BBC Sunday Morning programme, the Asda chairman said he feared that food prices ""are going to go higher, and they are going to stay high for quite some time"". Pressures on prices include the war in Ukraine and a resurgence of Covid in China, said Lord Rose. Oil and gas prices were already rising rapidly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war has pushed prices up further. In turn, this is ramping up raw materials costs for manufacturers and retailers - including for meats like chicken and staples such as pasta - with the price hikes being passed on to consumers. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? ""Chicken feed is going up, and all the other associated costs are going up,"" he said. ""I see no quick solution to this. ""Pasta is made from durum wheat, and durum wheat has gone up in price, so that's an inevitable cost increase."" Co-op chief executive Steve Murrells told the Sunday Times thatchicken could become as expensive as beef,externaldue to the war in Ukraine. Fast food chain Nando's, which specialises in chicken, said that some of its prices had gone up in April. Asda chairman Stuart Rose said consumers will suffer from fresh price rises Lord Rose said retailers ""will do what we can"" to shield customers from raw materials cost increases, but added they were ""not immune from cost increases ourselves"" and would pass them on. He said supermarkets have staff, electricity, fuel, insurance and transport costs, alongside raw materials costs. ""If you're baking biscuits or baking cakes, [energy] goes into the cost of the raw material that you have to pass on [to consumers],"" he said. ""What we have to try and do is mitigate that."" There is a danger of long-term effects on the economy from high inflation including ""a wage spiral"" and ""stagflation"" - where prices and wages go up, but the economy doesn't grow. ""They are both evil, and the government has got a very difficult and tricky road to navigate,"" Lord Rose said. He added that 90% of Asda customers were ""very worried about the cost of living, and how they are going to make ends meet"". Kwasi Kwarteng said it was not possible to predict how long inflation would remain high Business Secretary Mr Kwarteng said there was ""obviously an issue with cost of living increases"", but ""we don't know how long that will last"". ""Who can say how long any inflation will last?"" he said. ""It's a global issue, there's no doubt that every economy in the world is looking at the high prices and greater inflation."" He the government was ""dealing with it by creating jobs."" High inflation will not necessarily go on for years, Mr Kwarteng added, due to the government's ""energy security strategy"", which includes new nuclear and offshore wind power generation. Energy prices: What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Labour has repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to subsidise energy bills. Mr Kwarteng said he was against a windfall tax because it would discourage investment, but he said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had not ruled it out. Mr Sunak is ""going to look at all options"", Mr Kwarteng added. Talking about Labour's windfall tax proposals, its leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: ""We are not talking about taxing the profits they expected to make. This is the profits they didn't expect to make. ""We would then use that to reduce energy bills by up to Â£600."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the BBC that families dealing with cost of living pressures should not have to face a rise in National Insurance. The government has said this rise will help the NHS recover from Covid and fund social care in England. ""It's absolutely the wrong time for people to face a National Insurance rise,"" he said. ""Let's be clear, we've had 15 tax rises over the last decade from this Conservative government, at a time when four in 10  people are buying less groceries."" National Insurance: What will tax changes cost me? Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said inflation would be high for ""at least a year or two"". ""Millions of pensioners and families are really worried about the cost of living,"" he said. ""They're pretty annoyed that the Conservative government seem to be making it worse with tax rises."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This week, as most people received their pay packet, they finally see the reality of the Tory-made cost of living crisis - a hike in National Insurance, soaring bills and no support from Westminster.""

"A mysterious art installation in St Petersburg which translates as ""we will replace"" No one knows who put it here. But something rather odd has appeared in the centre of St Petersburg. A bizarre art installation made up of one word: ""ZAMESTIM"" (""We will replace""). Each letter is the first letter of an international brand that has suspended operations in Russia. Their company logos are featured, too. Z is for Zara. A is for Adidas. M means McDonald'sâ¦ Hundreds of international companies have pulled out of Russia in protest at the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine. Officials here have been trying to sound upbeat, claiming that Russia will find local replacements for foreign items no longer available. But the disappearance of global products and services adds to Russia's growing sense of international isolation. That seems a strange thing to be saying in St Petersburg. After all, Emperor Peter the Great designed and built this city to make Russia feel like a part of Europe. Mural on the side of a building in St Petersburg Out of marshland he created a breathtakingly beautiful Russian Amsterdam or Venice, with myriad canals and stunning palaces. With the help of European artists and architects rose an imperial capital with a European face. Yet three centuries on, the gulf between Russia and Europe grows wider by the day. Do Russians care? Many here claim not to. ""Russia's not Europe. Russia is Russia,"" says Lubov, who has stopped to chat to me by the ""ZAMESTIM"" art installation. Lubov tells me she doesn't follow what's happening in Ukraine. ""It's an unpleasant news story,"" she says. ""So, I try not to watch TV. So that I don't get upset."" My next conversation next to ""ZAMESTIM"" is with Raisa. She gets all her news from Russian TV. ""The Ukrainians are to blame for the violence,"" Raisa says. ""They're ganging up on us. Those nationalists are deploying weapons on our border. How certain are you that what Russian TV is telling you is the truth?"" I ask. ""Knowing the Russian people like I do, I'm 100% sure."" How many Raisas are there in Russia? What percentage of the Russian public support what President Putin calls his ""Special Military Operation"" in Ukraine? More than 80%, according to recent surveys. I'm sceptical. In an authoritarian country like Russia, the accuracy of public opinion polling is questionable. Fear skews results. Over the past two months, most of the Russians we have approached on the streets for interview have declined to speak about Ukraine, preferring to keep their opinions to themselves. Of those who did express views on the record, many repeated almost word for word what state TV has been telling them, reproducing the parallel reality created by the Kremlin. They speak of Russian troops ""liberating Ukraine"" and ""fighting Nazism in Ukraine."" Graffiti reads ""no to war"" But when I take a stroll through the historic centre of St Petersburg, I discover a very different picture. Among the city's famous courtyards, I find plenty of anti-war graffiti. In some cases, anti-Putin slogans, too, have been scrawled on walls. There are other forms of protest. Earlier this month St Petersburg artist Sasha Skochilenko was arrested and charged with spreading fake news about the Russian armed forces. She is accused of replacing price tags in a supermarket with anti-war messages. Sasha is being held in pre-trial detention. ""This shows that free speech in our country is being stamped out,"" Sasha Skochilenko's partner, Sonia Subbotina, tells me. ""It shows that political repression is getting worse and that people with anti-war views are being persecuted and put in prison."" Sasha Skochilenko has been charged with spreading fake news ""There was protest activity in Russia. People were coming out to protest. But each protest is a major risk. You can be arrested, you can be beaten, you can be put in jail. Right now I feel completely lost. I don't know if anything can be done."" Those in power in Russia are demanding unflinching support from the Russian people: for the direction in which the Kremlin is taking Russia, away from Europe; for the anti-Western rhetoric emanating from Moscow; and for Russia's military offensive in Ukraine - no matter what the consequences here at home.

"Ukraine's MiG-29s are not as advanced as some of Russia's fighters Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called the ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"". ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". It describes the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" as ""a collective image of pilots of the Air Force's 40th tactical aviation brigade, who defend the sky over the capital"", rather than a single man's combat record. For weeks, Ukrainians did not have a name to go with the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" - but that did not stop the story going viral on social media. It was used as a marketing brand bya Ukrainian model aircraft manufacturer,external, while Ukrainian Iryna Kostyrenko showed offa military badge,externalinspired by the legend. And the defence ministry tweeted a video celebrating Tarabalka's heroism. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Military experts told the BBC they doubted that one pilot could have downed as many as 40 Russian planes. Ukrainian military historian Mikhail Zhirohov described the Ghost of Kyiv story as ""propaganda for raising morale"". Speaking to the BBC from Chernihiv, he said that early on in the war the Russians dominated Ukrainian airspace, so a Ukrainian pilot ""could only shoot down two or three"". ""It's essential to have this propaganda, because our armed forces are smaller, and many think we can't be equal to them [the Russians]. We need this in wartime,"" he said. The fact that Ukrainian pilots are still denying Russia total mastery of the skies, flying inferior, older Russian-designed MiG-29s, inspired this modern legend. With all its military might, Russia has had more than two months to knock out Ukraine's air defences - and failed. The Ukrainian authorities fuelled the Ghost of Kyiv legend just days into the war. The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) showed a fighter pilot on the Telegram messaging service, with a caption calling the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" an ""angel"" for downing 10 Russian planes. But it did not name the ""angel"", and media reports later said the photo used was an old one. On 27 February Ukraine called the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" an ""angel"" for downing 10 Russian planes A Ukrainian military expert who requested anonymity told the BBC the Ghost of Kyiv story ""has helped to raise morale at a time when people need simple stories"". Ukraine's morale has also been boosted bythe Moskva story. First, Ukrainian border guards defied the Russian missile cruiser with a rude gesture, commemorated with a popular postage stamp. Then Ukraine allegedly sank it - the pride of Russia's Black Sea Fleet - with two Neptune missiles. Russia admitted there was a fire on board, and that the ship sank, but made no mention of a missile attack. Heroic fighter pilots have entered the national mythology of other countries too. The UK celebrates the brave Royal Air Force pilots who outwitted the mighty Nazi Luftwaffe in the 1940 Battle of Britain. Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear 'My city's being shelled, but mum wonât believe me' Tips on how to spot Ukraine fakes And Russia itself glorifies the sacrifices of its World War Two pilots, who were outgunned by the Germans. Some deliberately crashed into enemy planes after running out of bullets. Legends like the Ghost of Kyiv are not surprising when there are such contrasting figures given for Russian and Ukrainian losses: there is plenty of room for embellishment. On 30 April, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said that in the war so far Russia had lost 190 planes and 155 helicopters. But independent military analysts Oryx reckon the Russian losses to be 26 planes and 39 helicopters, as well as 48 drones (UAVs). Both Russia and Ukraine are very secretive about their own losses. Counting is difficult, because aircraft often crash in Russian-held territory, and some manage to land in Russia. Portable anti-aircraft missiles are a key part of defending the skies Experts agree that in most cases Russian aircraft were downed with surface-to-air missiles, especially man-portable air defence systems (Manpads). Justin Crump of the security consultancy Sybilline says the Ghost of Kyiv legend is important because in our social media age ""people need myths, heroes and legends, to provide cohesion and meaning"".

"This video can not be played Father who beat addiction watched his son die from alcoholism Fred Parry credits his 20-year sobriety to the time he spent in Castle Craig, a private rehab clinic in the Scottish Borders. The 66-year-old says recovering from alcoholism was the best thing that ever happened to him, and is now a cellist, a music teacher, a husband and father. When his son Adam began battling addiction, Mr Parry sent him to the same clinic in the hope that he would also recover. But on 6 May, 2021, Adam died in his room after a suspected withdrawal seizure. He was 32. Adam Parry died age 32 after a suspected alcohol-related seizure ""I couldn't get into his room to see him, I had to get the fire brigade to get in,"" said Mr Parry. ""It was horrific, absolutely horrific. It shouldn't have happened. ""Quite often we can get angry with addicts - for families it's torment when they see what it does to a loved one. ""But I also was aware of the torment that Adam was going through, he was tortured but he couldn't find a way out."" Mr Parry, from Glasgow, described Adam as a well-spoken, highly intelligent young man who was always reading two or three books at a time. ""We have this conception of what an alcoholic looks like - Adam didn't present like that,"" he said. Adam, left, and his younger brother Fraser His addiction began to take over when he started studying chemistry at the University of St Andrews - he had failed exams which led to him dropping out altogether. After growing frustrated with Community Alcohol Treatment (CAT) staff, Mr Parry paid Â£15,000 for Adam to attend rehab at Castle Craig - which he said helped Adam stay sober for about three years. When Mr Parry attended the service in 2000, he said it was paid for by the NHS and social care. But in 2017, when Adam was offered a place at the University of Glasgow, his sobriety began to slip. Adam dropped out of the University of St Andrews after his addiction worsened ""Through all this whole period of time we believed Adam had some mental health problems that ran in conjunction with his addiction,"" said Mr Parry. ""But trying to get those addressed was impossible. Seeing a psychiatrist wasn't going to happen. The help he was offered was very piecemeal, the onus was on him to turn up at a certain place, a certain time. ""It seems that when you're suffering from addiction your life is chaotic, you don't know what time of day it is or what day of the week, yet you're expected to turn up at certain appointments."" Eventually, while unemployed and living with his parents, Adam's drinking became more erratic. His father said he would spend benefits money on alcohol, then wean himself off when he ran out of money - a process which led to his hospitalisation from alcohol-related seizures. In the six months before his death he was in hospital six times from seizures. The family wanted to send him back to rehab, but they could not afford it - meanwhile Mr Parry said that often, Adam was too unwell to consent to further treatment as his health deteriorated. Now, he wants the Scottish government to improve access to addiction treatment services, including residential rehab. Mr Parry said: ""I was told by one of the doctors there's nothing you can do for an alcoholic, all you can do is lock them up and throw the key away - I was told that in front of Adam in the hospital. ""[Rehab] would have been the treatment of choice for Adam. But unfortunately Adam didn't need just six weeks in rehab, he needed a lot longer with a proper structure when he came out of rehab."" In August, National Records of Scotland statistics showed that deaths caused by alcohol had risen to theirhighest level in a decade. They rose by 17% from the previous year to 1,190 - the highest figure since 2008. The Scottish Conservatives have proposed a Right to Recovery Bill which would protect the right to addiction treatment in law - which would include residential rehab. On Friday, the party said a public consultation suggested about 77% of respondents supported the bill. The party's Shadow Health Secretary Dr Sandesh Gulhane said: ""We believe right to recovery is a crucial part of the solution and I'm delighted to see the extremely positive response to it from stakeholders, who recognise it's a common-sense bill drawn up in consultation with experts in the addiction field. ""At the moment, too many people with addiction problems are unable to access the help they need, but this legislation would enshrine in law their right to receive potentially life-saving treatment, including residential rehab."" Scotland's alcohol deaths at highest level for a decade 'I'd be discharged from hospital and start drinking again' Scottish alcohol deaths increased during pandemic Drugs Policy Minister Angela Constance said the Scottish government had given Â£250m over five years to improve access to addition services. She said: ""The Scottish government will give the bill a sympathetic hearing and we look forward to seeing the analysis of the consultation and a draft bill. ""While that bill process is ongoing my focus is on taking action now and delivering new investment to improve services and save lives."" Scottish Labour's drug policy spokeswoman Claire Baker added the party would back any proposals that would save lives. She added: ""There is no one silver bullet that will fix this issue - we need to use every power at our disposal now to deliver the treatment and support needed to help people.""

"Glasgow is one city where demand for flats is rising Demand for flats is reviving in UK cities, as property buyers return to more settled working patterns, new research shows. Interest in flats overtook searches for terraced houses since the start of this year, property portal Rightmove said. But the hunt for extra space, which dominated during the pandemic, remains a key factor for buyers and renters. ""Annexe"" is buyers' most popular search term, Rightmove said, with garages and gardens also high on the list. The property website analysed its data for the BBC to show how buyers and renters looking for properties were shifting their priorities. A picture has emerged of a renewed interest in urban and commuter areas, and a shift in the type of property being sought. In January last year, a terraced house was the most popular, it said, ahead of detached houses and flats. A year on, flats recorded the highest demand. ""In the initial stages of the pandemic, houses stole the show, as people looked for as much room as possible. As restrictions have eased, being closer to city amenities has become more of a priority,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's property data expert. During lockdowns, data showed property hunters wanted countryside and coastal properties with gardens, and extra space indoors to work. In the last five years, house prices have risen fastest for detached houses in predominantly rural locations, according to research by the Nationwide Building Society. The average price rise for a rural property of 29% over that period, outstripped the 18% increase in urban areas. Average house prices in North Devon rose by 24% last year alone. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom Second homes and living costs force out young buyers But spacious, rural homes have been in short supply. As they became less affordable too, some of the focus has shifted back to commuter areas and city centres. That shift has accelerated since the start of this year as workers began to spend more time at their office desks rather than the kitchen table. Market commentators also suggest students and office-based first-time buyers are driving up demand in cities. Jack Hunter is one of those first-time buyers. The 26-year-old said he was ""ecstatic"" to have managed to buy a flat near the centre of Glasgow in recent weeks. ""Friends have been to 30 viewings and made eight offers and are still looking,"" said Mr Hunter, who works in IT and technology sales. ""I don't know if this will be my forever home, but I am glad to be on the ladder."" Mr Hunter said the location and access to a parking space were significant positives. Glasgow, like many UK cities, saw a race for space among buyers during Covid lockdowns. Although the impact was not as dramatic as in London, estate agents say there has been a rebound for city properties. Renters and buyers are spending as much as they can afford, says John O'Malley John O'Malley, from agency Pacitti Jones, said that demand for Glasgow's tenement flats had returned, with first-time buyers looking for something affordable and close to the city centre. Higher demand for flats to buy is mirrored in the rental market with higher demand for city centre properties to rent. The number of renters in rural areas enquiring about available properties in cities has jumped 52% compared to January last year, while the number of renters in cities enquiring about rural properties has dropped 10%, the Rightmove data shows. A lack of homes available to buy or rent has been the biggest problem across the market, according to experts. This has driven up prices, even as the higher cost of living bites. A survey of 3,000 people by the Nationwide indicated that 38% of those asked were either in the process of moving or considering a move - far outstripping the number of homes on the market. Only one in five of them was doing so to try to reduce their spending on housing. On Friday, the lender saidUK property prices had increased by 12.1% in the last year. Official forecasts suggest that, although the pace of growth is expected to slow owing to the pressure on household budgets, there is little prospect of a fall in house prices. The ambition of adding value to a home, as well as the long-term prospect for many people of working at home for some of the week, has influenced the priorities of potential buyers. Airbnb to let staff work from home indefinitely Analysis of search terms by users on the Rightmove website indicates that buyers at the start of their enquiries show the most interest in whether a property has an ""annexe"". The next most popular terms are ""acre"" to check space, and ""garage"" possibly for conversion. Renters have different requirements. Top of the list is ""pets"" to check they are permitted by landlords, followed by wanting to know if the place is ""furnished"". A garden is still in renters' and buyers' top five search terms so, despite the pull of the city lights, the Covid-inspired demand for green space is far from extinguished.

"Russian military vehicles on the streets of Kherson. The Russian rouble will be used in Kherson from Sunday, according to Russia-backed forces that have taken control of the southern Ukrainian city. However, Kherson's Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who has now been overthrown by Russian authorities, has said that he doesn't believe this will be possible while the only working banking system in the region is Ukrainian, not Russian. Despite being occupied for 60 days, many residents are trying to find small ways to defy the Russian forces - like exchanging any roubles they receive back into Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia. But there are very few ways to safely snub the Russian army when it occupies your streets. Z signs - a Russian pro-war symbol - have appeared around the city. Russian flags hang above Kherson's government buildings. Ukrainian TV has been mostly cut off, changed to Russian news. Russian soldiers drive armoured vehicles through the city centre, between a network of check points. Now, changing the region's currency is yet another bid to erase Ukrainian identity from the city. ""I think most people will leave here if the rouble is introduced,"" Olga, who didn't want to use her real name, told me from inside Kherson. ""At the moment there are still currency exchanges operating in the city. If I am paid in roubles, I think I will just go and exchange it for hryvnia, I think others will too. It's just a small act of protest."" What does Putin want from Russia's war in Ukraine? Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol? Olga is not the only one with this plan. Ukrainian news reports have said that some pensions have been handed out in roubles around Kherson, but that people have already exchanged it back into Ukrainian hryvnia. Life in Kherson has become increasingly difficult. Many now feel nervous about even speaking to a journalist. When we reach Olga and ask how she is feeling, she sighs. ""I'm alive and I have food,"" she says. Around 40% of the population have fled in the two months since this key, strategic city was taken by Russia, according to the mayor. Many residents tell us about their struggle to pay for what few goods there are, as supermarket shelves lie empty. They say that shops, restaurants and businesses have closed and parts of the economy have ground to a halt, cut off from much of the world. Earlier this week, Russian forces appointed a new administration in Kherson because Mr Kolykhaiev was ""not cooperating"" with the occupied forces, according to Russian state news agency Ria. The Ukrainian mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, has now been replaced with a Russian administration Speaking on video call from somewhere in the region, with piles of binders and a toy camouflage jeep sitting on shelves behind him, Mr Kolykhaiev says he has not stopped working. He is sceptical of whether Russia can successfully introduce the rouble. ""I have no confirmation that it's been introduced,"" he says. ""When can it appear? When the treasury and the banking system of Ukraine will stop working? Anything can happen under occupation, I can't get into Russia's head to find out what they are thinking. If they do try to introduce the rouble zone here, we would be plunged back into 1992 when Ukraine gained its independence."" Ukrainian authorities had suggested that Russia could try to hold a referendum in the region on 1 May, asking voters whether they want independence from Ukraine. Any attempt to do this would be seen as a way to legitimise Russia's intervention, suggesting that residents no longer want to be part of Ukraine and painting Russia as liberators. Russia held a referendum in Crimea after Moscow annexed it in 2014, and also in the Russian-backed separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia has denied plans to hold a vote in Kherson, and for now residents in the city say they've seen no sign of it. Rumours swirl on social media channels about what could happen. Some Ukrainians are worried that Russia will simply fake the result and use records of their identity documents - which they fear the Russians could gain access to in the administrative buildings they now occupy - to back it up. ""I'm not sure they even need the population here to know that there is a referendum,"" says Olga. ""I guess they can do it without us. Maybe I already voted."" Several people inside Kherson told us that the routes out to safer parts of Ukraine have now been shut altogether. The only road available is through Crimea which means travelling into Russian territory, something several Ukrainians told us they would not be prepared to do. Maxim felt this was his only route to safety. He didn't want his name to be used as his family are still inside the city. At the border he was subject to a long interrogation as a security guard inspected his body for tattoos. ""It was like a film,"" he said. ""You sit on a suitcase under the scorching sun to be interrogated. I would never have imagined I would have to go through this. I was really horrified, because it's scary - people with machine guns are walking past you."" His favourite artist almost got him into difficulties. ""They were asking me the same questions on repeat,"" he says. ""I have a David Bowie lightning tattoo and they asked me 'Is that Azov?'"" The Azov battalion are a controversial regiment that was originally a far-right group later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Many supermarket shelves in Kherson are empty Maxim says that many of the cars in the queue had Kherson number plates. He has since safely travelled through Georgia and on to Europe.

"An industry boss called the crisis ""unprecedented"" Sri Lanka has sharply increased prices of commonly used medication, the second such rise in six weeks, as it struggles to deal with an economic crisis. Antibiotics, certain painkillers and medication for heart conditions are among those hit by a 40% mark-up. Sri Lankans have had to take short courses of medicines or look overseas for supplies. The government says it has no other option than to increase the cost of pharmaceutical products. It follows measures to help slow the depletion of foreign exchange reserves amid a crippling financial crisis. Among the measures were restrictions or bans on the import of some essential goods, including foods and medicines. ""This is not something that government is doing willingly,"" Nalaka Godahewa, Sri Lanka's minister for mass media, told the BBC. He said the devaluation of the rupee and the fact that most medicine is imported by the private sector meant the government had no choice, otherwise there would be a serious shortage. Health professionals are worried that the scarcity of medicine is forcing people to buy less than the prescribed limit. ""The situation is bad. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed for five days. Now my customers are saying give me the antibiotics only for two or three days. How will it work?"" Ruchira Hewawasam, who runs a pharmacy in Colombo, said. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out Sri Lanka requests urgent financial help from IMF No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system Some fear that even for those willing and able to pay higher prices, some medication is in short supply. Velupillai Wigneswaran who lives in the central Ratnapura district, has been trying to find prescription tablets for his sister, who suffers from a serious neurological disorder, for the past year. ""We tried several pharmacies but the medicines are not available. Doctors have advised us not to take different medicine. We are trying to get the tablets from India through our friends,"" he said. Health workers fear that medicine shortages are forcing people to buy less than they are prescribed Without the medicine, Mr Wigneswaran said his sister was suffering and he was not sure what will happen to her health. ""The crisis we are facing in the pharmaceutical sector is unprecedented. The sharp increase in medicine prices will take its toll,"" Azam Jaward, Vice President of Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry, told the BBC. Antibiotics for paediatrics, life-saving antibiotics, steroids are among the medicines difficult to obtain. This comes against the backdrop of explosive public anger at the rising prices of other essential items such as cooking gas, milk powder and fuel. Thousands of people have been protesting against the worsening shortages and calling for the government to resign. India has offered to supply medicines as part of a loan programme. But that process has been slowed down due to bureaucratic hurdles. The government has approached international agencies like the World Bank to help buy essential items like medicines. ""They have already told us something like $600 million will be coming forth and when that comes we should be able to bring some of these prices down,"" Mr Godahewa said.

"There are around 300 betting shops in Northern Ireland Betting shops and bingo halls in Northern Ireland will be able to open later for the first time on a Sunday following the introduction of new gambling laws. The new legislation also means they can open on Good Friday from next year. It brings gambling laws into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The NI Turf Guardians' Association (NITGA) described Sunday openings as ""a positive development"". However the organisation, which represents a number of bookmakers in Northern Ireland, said that as the law change had not been expected until later in the spring, many betting shops may not be able to open later. ""The timing of the law coming into force is earlier than anticipated and it had been expected this would not take place until mid to late May,"" a spokesman said. ""Preparation is now under way for Sunday opening, which is expected to lead to the creation of up to 250 part-time jobs."" The Department for Communities confirmed the legislation had been given Royal Assent earlier this week having passed through the Stormont Assembly in early March. ""This means that from 27 April, premises-based bookmakers here can trade on Sundays and Good Fridays,"" a department spokeswoman said. The change to Sunday opening also applies to bingo halls It is considered thebiggest change to gambling laws in Northern Irelandin almost 40 years. The previous laws - contained in the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order - date back to 1985. NITGA said the law change addresses ""a longstanding anomaly whereby customers were able to place bets online, on a racecourse, or at a bookmaker shop across the border on Sundays but were unable to go to a bookmaker shop in Northern Ireland"". ""Given that such a significant number of sporting events take place on a Sunday, demand had to be met elsewhere, including through illegal betting in pubs and clubs,"" a NITGA spokesman added. The NI Turf Guardians' Association represents the majority of betting shops trading in Northern Ireland, of which there are about 300, with 1,500 staff employed.
