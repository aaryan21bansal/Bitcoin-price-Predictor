"The number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell at its fastest rate ever in April as the lockdown forced people to stay indoors, industry figures show. Footfall fell by more than 80% after all but essential shops closed their doors, according to Springboard. That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations. Springboard said the April slump was a ""decline of unprecedented magnitude"". UK 'set for deepest downturn in living memory' Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink Shopping centres were the worst hit by the drop in footfall, as visits fell by 84.8%. Meanwhile, the number of visits to High Streets around the country fell by 83.3% and footfall at retail parks was 68.1% lower. The presence of supermarkets and wide-open spaces, which allowed for better social distancing, meant retail parks performed slightly better than other areas, according to the retail analyst company. ""What has become clear, but what is not obvious from the headline rate, is the shift in consumer behaviour away from large towns and cities to smaller more local centres,"" said Diane Wehrle from Springboard. At 20 smaller town centres, including Harold Hill, Prescot, Kenilworth and Dudley, footfall decreased by less than 60%. Meanwhile, major city centres such as Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Bristol and London were among the 20 areas that saw the biggest drops in footfall. ""The overriding focus on safe shopping and the greater emphasis on community that has come to the fore means that trips to larger towns and cities have been curtailed,"" said Ms Wehrle. ""Indeed, it is the first evidence available that suggests how consumers may respond to easing of restrictions."" She said it was a contrast to ""pre-coronavirus days"" when small High Streets faced an increasing struggle to attract shoppers. ""The path of recovery for retail may well be led by smaller high streets which can offer both safety and community benefits. ""For larger destinations, the emphasis on safety suggests that those environments that have the capability to control shopper numbers - such as retail parks and shopping centres - will be the next phase of recovery, followed by large towns and cities which inevitably face issues around pedestrian congestion.""

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""Stay alert will mean stay alert, by staying home as much as possible"" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has insisted now is the right time to update the government's coronavirus message from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", amid widespread criticism. PM Boris Johnson announced the slogan for England, telling people to ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"",ahead of his national address. Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandare sticking with ""stay at home"". Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I don't know what 'stay alert' means."" The first minister added at the daily briefing in Edinburgh: ""For Scotland right now, given the fragility of the progress we've made, given the critical point that we are at, then it would be catastrophic for me to drop the 'stay at home' message. ""I am particularly not prepared to do it in favour of a message that is vague and imprecise."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warned people might be ""puzzled"" by the change. But Mr Jenrick told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""Stay alert will mean stay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out, by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others in the workplace and the other settings that you'll go to."" A further 269 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths recorded to 31,855. The number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. The government has also missed its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day for the eighth day in a row, with 92,837 tests on Saturday. PM unveils 'conditional plan' to reopen society What will be the 'new normal'? The prime minister shared the new government slogan on Twitter, detailing some of the guidance issued to the public.

A No 10 spokesman added: ""Everyone has a role to play in keeping the rate of infection (R) down by staying alert and following the rules."" Mr Ashworth called on the government to clarify what the new slogan meant. ""When you're dealing with a public health crisis of this nature, you need absolute clarity from government about what the advice is. There is no room for nuance,"" he said. ""The problem with the new message is that many people will be puzzled by it,"" he added. Mr Jenrick said the updated message was a ""cautious"" one, because the rate of infection remained high and the public were ""understandably anxious"". He dismissed Mr Ashworth's concerns, saying: ""The public are capable of understanding a broader message as we move into the next phase of the virus."" However, the Liberal Democrats' acting leader Sir Ed Davey said changing the slogan ""makes the police's job near-impossible and may cause considerable alarm"" as he urged the government to publish the evidence that has informed the new strategy. And on social media, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham called the updated advice ""too ambiguous"" and ""unenforceable"". The UK government's new slogan is part of moving into the next phase of the response to coronavirus. Staying at home where possible will remain part of the strategy, but ministers want to ""broaden the message"". Some are worried the new campaign is ambiguous and muddies the water. In Wales and Scotland, the devolved governments who control health have made clear they will keep the original slogan - stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. So from tomorrow, messaging will be different in different parts of the UK. And I understand there are real concerns in the Scottish government about how people will react - and fears it will be harder to get them to follow their advice to stay at home unless essential. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would continue to use the ""stay at home"" message in Scotland and later said she had asked the UK government ""not to deploy"" the new slogan there.

Leaders of the devolved nations - which have the power to set their own lockdown regulations - said they had not been consulted over the ""stay alert"" message. Ms Sturgeon said the first she heard of the updated guidance was in newspaper reports. Giving Scotland's daily coronavirus briefing, she said that, other than allowing people to leave home for exercise more than once a day, the rules there had not changed. ""We remain in lockdown for now and my ask of you is to remain at home"", she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is part of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned some people might take the more generalised ""alert"" slogan as a ""green light"" to socialise. ""I do not think this is a helpful message in terms of guiding behaviour. It does not give advice as to what people should do,"" she told the PA news agency. Meanwhile, the government's pandemic response has been called ""wishy-washy"" by a body representing police officers in London. It comes after a police force in east London shared an image of a crowded park in Hackney on Saturday, where hundreds of people, they said, were eating and drinking alcohol. Police officers patrol Greenwich Park, in London, on Saturday. Ken Marsh, from the Metropolitan Police Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme authorities ""needed to be firmer right from the beginning"" and that if authorities had been more stringent from the outset ""we would have a better result now"". But another adviser to Sage, Prof Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend outdoor activities posed a ""relatively low risk"" so long as people with symptoms were not going out and that those who needed to quarantine themselves did so. In his address, the prime minister announced the launch of an alert system for tracking coronavirus in England and unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society, allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mr Johnson also said people who could not work from home should return to the workplace - but avoid public transport. The lockdown has already been extended for another three weeks in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to 28 May.

"The Northern Ireland Executive says it will ""consider its plan for a phased, strategic approach to recovery"" at a meeting on Monday. A statement from First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill was issued on Sunday night. Politicians in NI had emphasised the ""stay at home message"" ahead of the prime minister's address on Sunday. The executive has already extended lockdown in NI until 28 May. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill took part in a Cobra call on Sunday afternoon with the prime minister. On Sunday evening,Boris Johnson unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society,allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mrs Foster said on Sunday evening ""we have flattened the curve of infection, reduced the R rate to below one and protected our health service but we are not out of the woods yet"". Arlene Foster said the message on the whole remained to ""stay at home"" ""It is important that we continue to follow this advice,"" she added. ""As the executive begins to finalise our plans for recovery, we need to strike the balance between continuing to protect lives and the health service and give people hope for the future. ""The changes that we will introduce will be gradual, proportionate and based on scientific and medical advice and will be taken at the right time and in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland."" Ms O'Neill said ""we are at a critical stage in the fight against the virus and so our recovery must be phased, gradual and strategic"". She added: ""The decisions this executive will take in the days and weeks ahead are some of the biggest we will ever have to make. ""We know that six weeks into the restrictions, people need some light at the end of the tunnel. ""We also know that recovery will only happen one step at a time, to do otherwise risks undermining the sacrifices people have already made and increases the risk of a second spike in the future."" Health officials in England have changed their message to ""stay alert"" with regard to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. In NI, the message remains the same. Earlier on Sunday, Mrs Foster said the message on the whole remained to ""stay at home"". She added Northern Ireland will have a ""road map"" for moving out of lockdown at the beginning of the week. She said people in Northern Ireland had complied with the social distancing regulations although ""compliance is beginning to fray"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Health Minister Robin Swann both tweeted ""stay at home"" messages on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that in a cross-party call with the prime minister on Sunday, he had expressed concerns about the ""stay alert"" message. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he felt the message ""doesn't make any sense and nobody will understand it"". ""I said very clearly to Boris Johnson, it's not a burglar we are worried about it's a virus,"" he added. Colum Eastwood said he felt the ""stay alert"" message ""does not make any sense"" And Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""It is our strong belief that now is not the time to change the message or direction. ""Until the R rate is reduced we must continue to keep staying home, keep protecting our NHS & above all, keep saving lives."" Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said ""the message for people across Northern Ireland is to stay home, safe safe and protect our NHS"". Earlier on Sunday Scotland's First Ministerasked the UK government not to advertise its new ""stay alert"" message north of the border. Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus, #StayHomeSaveLives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage."" In Wales, the country's First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpeople should stay home ""wherever you can"". On Sunday, it was reported that five more people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in Northern Ireland. That brings the number of Covid-19 related deaths to 435, according to Department of Health figures. They show the number of people with a positive laboratory completed test is now 4,119. The total number of laboratory completed tests is 38,984. These figures are one of two sets published in Northern Ireland. The others are weekly statistics from Northern Ireland's Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra), which cover all fatalities where coronavirus has been recorded on the death certificate.

Supermarkets prioritise deliveries to vulnerable Call for 'universal Covid-19 testing' in care homes Figures released by Northern Ireland's Statistics Agency (Nisra) on Friday showed there have been 516 coronavirus-related deaths recorded overall in NI - including 232 in care homes, and four in hospices. Official statistics on Friday showed that, for a second week, there were more deaths in care homes (71) than hospitals (39). Overall, there have been 232 care home deaths related to coronavirus. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has calledfor universal testing for Covid-19 across all of Northern Ireland's care homes immediately.

"The general secretary of the Unite trade union has said workers ""should refuse"" to return to work if there is no ""safe environment"" for them. Len McCluskey was speaking to the BBC afterBoris Johnson unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society. The prime minister said those who could not work from home should be ""actively encouraged to go to work"" in England. Meanwhile, business groups have called for clarity on what will need to change in the workplace. Mr McCluskey said it was every worker's ""statutory right"" to have such an environment and any worker ""unsure"" of having that available ""should not be pressured in going back to work"". He also said that he did not believe there should be any ""need for that"", as long as ""employers and government embrace expertise"". He added that the economy had to be restarted: ""Otherwise we'll be faced with mass unemployment, which will impact on everybody."" Can my boss force me to go back to work? Arrivals from France to escape UK quarantine Business groups including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) have urged the government to provide clear guidance on the relaxation of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. He added: ""It is imperative that companies have detailed advice on what will need to change in the workplace, including clarity on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE),"" said BCC director Adam Marshall. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""Small businesses will need time to adapt after the workplace guidance is published, and for smaller businesses it must be proportionate and focused on the overall outcome of maintaining safe working environments, achieved as straightforwardly as possible."" In a televised address, Mr Johnson said he wanted those in the construction and manufacturing industries to return to work this week. Caution was, however, urged by other trade groups, such as the Institute of Directors (IoD). Its director general, Jonathan Geldart, said it was vital the guidance was clear so that companies could plan how to return safely. ""As people with ultimate legal responsibility, directors need to have confidence that it's safe, and that if they act responsibly they won't be at undue risk. Businesses should consult with their people to put in place robust policies, which in many cases might not be an overnight process."" Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said businesses were ""keen to open and get the economy back on its feet"". ""But they also know putting health first is the only sustainable route to economic recovery. The message of continued vigilance is right,"" she said. She added: ""While stopping work was necessarily fast and immediate, restarting will be slower and more complex. It must go hand in hand with plans for schools, transport, testing and access to PPE. Firms will want to see a roadmap, with dates they can plan for."" Very little has changed in terms of the regulations and prohibitions first announced in March. The lockdown remains. Closed shops, for example, won't reopen. What we did get was a ""change of emphasis"" - that people should assume they should go back to work, rather than presume they should not. Some in government and in industry fear that the ""stay at home"" message has now deeply embedded itself in the minds of millions of workers. The prime minister's replacement of that message with ""stay alert"" in England is designed to get businesses to use the existing discretion in the lockdown regulations. The practicalities of that are not easy, however, with business groups and unions not agreeing on what constitutes a ""Covid-safe"" workplace. The government acknowledges that there won't be enough public transport options for people to return to work. Many workers will also face problems with childcare. On top of that, to the extent that some industries will reopen - such as construction and perhaps some forms of hospitality by July, any increase in the rate of infection could see the brakes applied quickly. The path ahead will be a delicate, difficult and constant balancing act between health and the economy. For now, the economy is definitively second priority. During his address, Mr Johnson added that workplaces would receive guidance on how to become ""Covid secure"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for those guidelines to be published. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News previously reported thatreduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible were among measures being considered to let workplaces reopen. One of seven draft plans to ease anti-coronavirus restrictions, seen by the BBC, also urged employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. As a result, the government is now paying the wages for nearly a quarter of UK jobs under a programme aimed at helping people put on leave due to the virus pandemic. Under the job retention scheme, it funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month. On Sunday, business groups also urged caution when it came to any future withdrawal of the support.

"The government has admitted sending about 50,000 coronavirus tests to the US last week for processing after ""operational issues"" in UK labs. The Department of Health said sending swabs abroad is among the contingencies to deal with ""teething problems"". The samples were airlifted to the US in chartered flights from Stansted Airport,the Sunday Telegraph said,external. Results will be validated in the UK and sent to patients as soon as possible. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said expanding Britain's virus testing network had involved setting up an ""entirely new"" lab network to process tests, adding ""contingencies"" - such as sending swabs abroad - were in place for when ""problems arise"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the kits had to be sent abroad because of a ""temporary failure"" at a lab. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the move ""shows our determination to get the job done"". Why did the UK need 100,000 tests a day? Coronavirus testing for key workers 'shambolic' UK government testing goal 'source of frustration' Meanwhile, the government has sent anurgent alert to hospitals,externalrecalling 15.8m protective goggles due to safety concerns. Although the ""Tiger Eye"" protectors, purchased in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic, were in CE marked boxes - meaning they should have met European Union safety requirements - the goggles have since been retested and do not provide proper splash protection. Commenting on the recall, which was firstreported in the Sunday Telegraph,external, a DHSC spokeswoman said the safety of front-line staff was ""our top priority"". She added that hospital trusts should have enough goggles to ""immediately stop"" using the ""Tiger Eye"" protectors. A further 9.2m of the goggles are in quarantine, she added. The revelations come as the government failed to hit the 100,000 daily tests target set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the seventh day in a row. There were 96,878 tests delivered in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday, down from 97,029 the day before.

But health leaders said they expected ""fluctuations"" in the figures, and that testing was still much higher than it was at the start of the outbreak. Speaking at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Saturday, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said he expected ""fluctuation"" in the day-to-day figures. He said: ""We are now really at a high plateau, in the region of 100,000 tests per day. ""I don't think we can read too much into day-to-day variations, but the macro picture is this is now at a much, much higher level than it ever was at the beginning of this crisis."" BBC health reporter Rachel Schraer said theUK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. But it also took several weeks to expand from an initial eight public health laboratories to a wider network of private and university labs. Unlike the UK, countries like Germany and South Korea rapidly stockpiled kits and made the test available to a larger number of labs. Prof Van-Tam also told the briefing that the test-and-trace strategy of finding people with the virus and tracking people they have been in contact with was ""part of the solution"" needed to ease the lockdown.

"For Sudeep Choudhury, work on merchant ships promised adventure and a better life. But a voyage on an oil tanker in West Africa, in dangerous seas far from home, would turn the young graduate's life upside down. His fate would come to depend on a band of drug-fuelled jungle pirates - and the whims of a mysterious figure called The King. The MT Apecus dropped anchor off Nigeria's Bonny Island shortly after sunrise. Sudeep Choudhury was at the end of a draining shift on deck. Looking towards land, he could make out dozens of other ships. On the shoreline beyond them, a column of white oil storage tanks rose out of the ground like giants. He had breakfast and then made two phone calls. One to his parents - he knew they worried about him, their only child - and one to his fiancee, Bhagyashree. He told her that everything was going to plan and that he would call her again later that day. He then clambered into bed for a sleep. It was 19 April, 2019. The small, ageing oil tanker and its crew of 15 had spent two days sailing south from the port of Lagos to the Niger Delta, where oil was discovered in the 1950s by Dutch and British businessmen seeking a swift fortune. Although he knew that vicious pirates roamed the labyrinthine wetlands and mangroves of the delta, Sudeep felt safe that tropical South Atlantic morning. Nigerian navy boats were patrolling and the Apecus was moored just outside Bonny, seven nautical miles from land, waiting for permission to enter port. The warm waters of the Gulf of Guinea, which lap across the coastline of seven West African nations, are the most dangerous in the world. It used to be Somalia, but now this area is the epicentre of modern sea piracy. Of all the seafarers held for ransom globally last year, some 90% were taken here. Sixty-four people were seized from six ships in just the last three months of 2019, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks such incidents. Many more attacks may have gone unreported. The bountiful oil found here could have made the people of the delta rich, but for most it has been a curse. Spills have poisoned the water and the land, and a fight over the spoils of the industry has fuelled violent crime and conflict for decades. In the villages above the pipelines that have netted billions for the Nigerian government and international oil companies, life expectancy is about 45 years. Militant groups with comic book names like the Niger Delta Avengers have blown up pipelines and crippled production to demand the redistribution of wealth and resources. Oil thieves siphon off thick black crude and process it in makeshift refineries hidden in the forest. The level of violence in the delta ebbs and flows - but the threat is always there. Sudeep woke up a few hours later to yelling and banging. The watchman in the ship's command room, high above the deck, had spotted an approaching speedboat carrying nine heavily-armed men. His cry of warning ricocheted around the 80m-long ship as the crew scrambled. They couldn't stop the pirates, but they could at least try to hide. Sudeep, just 28 but the ship's third officer, was in charge of the five other Indian crew working on the Apecus. There was no oil on board, so he knew the pirates would want to take human cargo for ransom. Americans and Europeans are highly prized because their companies pay the highest ransoms but in reality, most sailors come from the developing world. On the Apecus, the Indians were the only non-Africans. With less than five minutes to act, Sudeep gathered his men in the engine room in the bowels of the ship before running upstairs to set off an emergency alarm that would notify everyone on board. On his way back down, he realised he was only wearing the underwear he had gone to sleep in. Then he caught his first glimpse of  the attackers, who were wearing T-shirts and black face coverings, and brandishing assault rifles. They were alongside the vessel, confidently hooking a ladder onto the side. The Indians decided to hide in a small storeroom, where they crouched among lights, wires and other electrical supplies, and tried to still their panicked breathing. The pirates were soon prowling around outside, their voices echoing above the low hum of engine machinery. The sailors were trembling but stayed silent. Many ships that sail in the Gulf of Guinea invest in safe rooms with bullet-proof walls where crews can take shelter in exactly this kind of situation. The Apecus didn't have one. The men heard footsteps approaching and the bolt slid open with a clang. Get up. The pirates fired at the floor and a bullet fragment struck Sudeep in his left shin, lodging itself just an inch from the bone. The men marched the sailors outside and up onto the deck. They knew they had to move very quickly. The captain had put out a distress call and the gunshots might have been heard by other ships. The attackers ordered the Indians to climb down a ladder onto the waiting speedboat, which had two engines for extra speed. Chirag, a nervous 22-year-old on his first deployment at sea, was the first to comply. With the pirates' guns trained on them the others followed, as did the captain. The six hostages - five Indians and one Nigerian - squatted uncomfortably on the overcrowded boat as it began to motor away. The remaining crew, including one Indian who had managed to evade the attackers, emerged onto the deck. They watched as the pirates sped off towards the delta with their blindfolded captives, leaving the Apecus floating in the tide. The text message from the shipping agent arrived in the middle of the night. Dear Sir, understandably Sudeep's vessel has been hijacked. The Greek owner is co-ordinating the matter. Don't get panicky. No harm will come to Sudeep. Please keep patience. Pradeep Choudhury and his wife Suniti, sitting in their bedroom, were left reeling by this perfunctory message. They had spoken to their son just hours earlier. Pradeep began forwarding the text to family members and Sudeep's closest friends. Could this really be true? Had anyone heard from their son? Sudeep, as anyone who knows him will say, was mischievous growing up. He was restless, always wanting to get out of the house for an adventure. And his parents, especially his mother, would constantly worry about him. They have lived in Bhubaneswar, a small city in the state of Odisha on India's eastern coast, for most of Sudeep's life. It's a place that Indians living in the centres of power and influence - Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore - rarely, if ever, think about, but running a small photocopying shop from the front of their home gave the Choudhurys a comfortable life. On the busy pavements near their home in central Bhubaneswar, the faces of deities stare out from modest shrines. But before he left for Africa, Sudeep didn't really believe in any kind of god. Life would be what he and Bhagyashree could make of it. They met when they were teenagers. Now a software engineer, she has the air of a girl who would have been popular at school. The couple are the kind of aspirational young Indians whose dreams far eclipse the stable, traditional family lives that their parents craved. There are tens of millions like them in India, armed with degrees and certificates but coming of age in a lumbering economy that continues to churn out many more graduates than well-paying jobs. For Sudeep, a job in merchant shipping promised an escape from all of that. He was lured by stories of good money, plenty of work and a chance to see the world. And he's not alone - after Filipinos and Indonesians, Indians make up the largest contingent of global seafarers, working as deckhands, cooks, engineers and officers. Some 234,000 of them sailed on foreign-flagged vessels in 2019. But getting the right qualifications is complicated and Sudeep studied for five years, set on a path that cost his family thousands of dollars. At the age of 27, he finally qualified as a third officer and got a tattoo on his right forearm to celebrate: a little sailing boat bobbing on a cluster of triangles representing the sea, with a large anchor cutting straight through the middle like a dagger. On the first morning after the sailors were kidnapped, dozens of men emerged from the forest and fired their guns into the sky for nearly half an hour to celebrate. The five Indians, who had been left on a car-sized wooden platform floating on a mangrove swamp, stared hopelessly at the brown water below them. To get to their jungle prison they had been taken on a snaking, hours-long boat ride through the waterways of the delta. In those first days, the message from the pirates - reinforced with occasional beatings - was clear: if no-one pays a ransom, we will kill you. Sudeep was still living in his underwear and itched all night under buzzing mosquitoes that left his skin dotted with bites. He hadn't been given a bandage for the wound on his leg, so he had pushed mud into the hole. The humidity of the jungle meant the men were never dry. They shared a single dirty mat for a bed, and would snatch brief minutes of sleep before jolting awake and remembering where they were. Early on, the pirates had dragged a skeleton up from the swamp to show the sailors what had supposedly become of a former hostage whose boss had refused to pay. That wasn't the only macabre threat. On another day, they were shown a pile of concrete blocks. Try anything and we'll strap these to your legs and drop you in the ocean, the pirates told them. A rotating cast of guards kept watch from the riverbank, 10 or so metres away. They spent their time fishing, smoking marijuana and drinking a local spirit made from palm sap called kai-kai - but they also watched the hostages closely, occasionally training a gun on them and yelling out a warning, as if their captives might suddenly dive into the murky water and swim away. Over time, Sudeep would try to strike up a relationship with some of these men. He would gently ask them how they were, or if they had children. But the response was always silence, or a blunt warning.Don't talk to us.They appeared to be under strict orders but never referred to their leader - who seemed to be based elsewhere in the jungle - by name. He was just ""The King"". Sudeep and the other men - Chirag, 22, Ankit, 21, Avinash, 22, and Moogu, 34 - had little choice but to try to conserve their energy and wait for something to happen. Their lives fell into a kind of lethargic routine. Once a day, normally in mid-morning, they would get a bowl of instant noodles to share between the five of them. They would carefully ration the meal, passing around a grimy spoon and each taking one mouthful. They would repeat the ritual in the evening and hand back the empty bowl. They were given nothing to drink except muddy water, which was often mixed with petrol. Sometimes they were so thirsty they drank saltwater from the river. The Nigerian captain was kept separately in a hut nearby. He was treated better and the Indians began to loathe him for it. To pass time, the five men would talk about their lives back home and their plans for the future. They would watch the nature around them - snakes slithering up trees, birds taking flight through the mangroves. They would pray. If the pirates spotted a monkey, the quiet would be broken. The Indians would watch them scramble after it, spraying the animal with bullets. It would later be cooked over a bonfire but the meat was never shared with them. The sailors tried to keep track of each passing sunset by etching small arrows into the wooden planks that they slept on. They were at times delirious - some of them, including Sudeep, contracted malaria. In whispers, they would imagine a scenario where the pirates came to kill them and they fought back. If they were going to die, they could probably kill at least three of them on the way down, right? At moments like this they laughed, but it was a constant battle not to sink into despair. During the many quiet hours in which they would simply lie under the beating sun, Sudeep would think over and over what he could do to get them out, and what he would tell the Indian High Commission or his family if he got a chance to call. In his head, he was still trying to plan his wedding. The pirates' initial demand was for a ransom of several million dollars. It was an exorbitant sum and one they must have known was unlikely to be paid. But these kinds of ransom kidnappings involve complex and drawn-out negotiations, and in the undiscoverable warrens of the Niger Delta, time always seemed to be on their side. About 15 days after the attack, the pirates took Sudeep on a boat to another part of the forest, and handed him a satellite phone so he could appeal directly to the ship owner, a Greek businessman based in the Mediterranean port of Piraeus called Captain Christos Traios. His company, Petrogress Inc, operates several oil tankers in West Africa with swashbuckling names like the Optimus and the Invictus. Sudeep knew little about Capt Christos but had heard he was an aggressive, bad-tempered man. ""Sir, this is terrible. We are in a very bad condition. And I need you to act very fast because we might die here,"" he told him. His boss, furious about what had happened, was apparently unmoved. The pirates were incensed. ""We just want money,"" they would say over and over again. ""But if your people don't give us money, we will kill you."" Their business model is dependent on the compliance of ship bosses who, usually covered by insurance, will pay significant amounts to free their crew after weeks of negotiations. But in this case they were up against a stubborn ship owner. The key now, the kidnappers knew, would be to reach the families. Back in India, Sudeep's parents spent their nights lying awake. They knew so little about what had happened that their minds veered towards the worst in those hours before dawn broke, when the streets of Bhubaneswar would briefly be still. They feared their son would never emerge from a pirates' den that they could scarcely imagine. There was no way the family could afford to pay the pirates directly and it was never considered as a serious option. The Indian government doesn't pay ransoms but they hoped it would help them in other ways - by assisting the Nigerian navy to find the pirate camp, or forcing the ship owner to pay up. Bhagyashree and Swapna, a formidable cousin of Sudeep in her mid-30s, took charge of this effort. They corralled the family members of the kidnapped men into a WhatsApp group so they could co-ordinate efforts to get their boys freed. It soon became clear to Bhagyashree that the pirates would gain nothing by killing the sailors. But she was nervous about how long their patience would last. Pressuring the ship owner from all directions seemed the only feasible way to get her fiancee out.  And so in the car, in the bathroom stall at work, and at home lying in bed, she was online, tweeting, firing off pleading emails to anyone who might be able to help. After three weeks of near-silence, on day 17, the families had a breakthrough. A sister of one of the kidnapped men, Avinash, received a call from her brother in the Nigerian jungle. He told her that all the men were alive but they really needed help. The other families would go on to receive calls from their sons in the coming days - but not Bhagyashree and the Choudhurys. Strange relationships began to be forged. A relative of one of the sailors who works in the shipping industry, a man called Captain Nasib, began calling the pirates regularly on their satellite phone to check on the men's condition. But the tinny audio recordings he posted in the WhatsApp chat did not reassure the families. The ship owner ""does not care"" about the lives of his men and is ""playing around"", a pirate angrily told Capt Nasib in one phone call. On 17 May 2019 - day 28 - the pirates gave Sudeep the chance to speak to Capt Nasib, who assured him that the ordeal would only last a few more days. But Sudeep, as the ranking officer, was told he had to keep everyone's morale high in the meantime. ""I'm trying,"" Sudeep can be heard responding in Hindi in a crackly recording of the call. ""Tell my family that you talked to me."" Every few weeks the Indians were moved from one jungle lair to another. As negotiations with Capt Christos seemingly broke down, The King himself began to visit them. He would never say much, but the other pirates treated him with a reverence that suggested fear. His status as the group's leader almost seemed a consequence of his sheer size. All the pirates were muscle-bound and threatening but The King was especially hulking - at least 6ft 6in. He carried a much larger gun than the men under his command, and a leather belt filled with bullets was always strapped around his massive frame. He would turn up every four or five days and calmly smoke some marijuana before the captives. He would say that Capt Christos was still not playing ball and that this would have consequences. The King spoke deliberately, and with better English than the other men. After many weeks in captivity, the sailors were becoming bony and thin; their eyes were a pale yellow and their urine was at times blood-red. Each visit from the King felt like it brought them closer to the fate of the skeleton they had seen pulled from the mud. Then events took a more bizarre turn. Up until this point, what had happened to the Apecus seemed to be just another opportunistic ransom kidnapping. But in late May, unbeknown to the men who sat festering on those planks in the swamp, machinations were unfolding that seemed to point to a far more complex series of events. The Nigerian navy had publicly accused the tanker company of being involved in the transport of stolen crude oil from the Niger Delta to Ghana. The attack on the Apecus and the kidnapping, according to the navy, had actually been provoked by a disagreement between two criminal groups. There had even been arrests. The ship company's manager in Nigeria had apparently confessed to being involved in illicit oil trading. Capt Christos, the ship's owner, fervently denied this. In emails seen by the BBC, he blamed the Indian government for getting the Nigerian navy to detain his vessels and staff in order to force him to ""negotiate with terrorists"" and pay an ""incredible"" ransom. Indian authorities dispute this version of events. The Nigerian Navy didn't comment. It was a precarious situation for the captives. But the accusations - which put Capt Christos's tanker operations in Nigeria at risk - did seem to spur him to reach a resolution with the pirates. And so on 13 June, Sudeep's family finally learned from a government source that negotiations were complete and that payment was being arranged. At the same time, the sailors in the jungle were told that their ordeal might be coming to an end. The men woke up on the morning of 29 June 2019 like they had almost every day for the previous 70 days. At mid-morning, after handing over the bowl of noodles, one of the guards beckoned Sudeep over and whispered that if things worked out, this could be his last day in the jungle. Two hours later the guard returned with confirmation: the man bringing the money was on his way. The frail Ghanaian man in his mid-60s who approached in a boat that afternoon, nervously clutching a heavy plastic bag with US dollars peeking out of the top, did not look like a seasoned negotiator. Within minutes of his arrival, it was clear something was not right. A group of pirates began beating the old man. The King, bellowing about the money being short, pulled a small knife out of his belt and stabbed him in the leg, leaving him writhing on the muddy ground. He then approached the Indians and told them that while the Ghanaian would be staying, all six captives were free to go. His men wouldn't stop them, but if another pirate group picked them up, they were on their own. He looked Sudeep in the eye: ""Bye-bye."" The men did not hesitate. They ran to the water's edge, where the fishing boat that had brought the bag man was parked. Sudeep told the driver to take them where he had come from. After more than two months he was still in his underwear, though the pirates had given him a torn T-shirt to wear. The boat rocked unsteadily from side to side as it motored away. After nearly four hours, the driver said he was out of fuel and stopped at a jetty. In the distance, on the outskirts of a small village, a group of barefoot men were playing football. The ragged sailors approached them. When they explained they had been kidnapped, they were ushered into a house and given bottles of water which they gulped down one after the other. Three of the village's biggest men kept guard outside the guesthouse they were housed in during the night. The Indians, though weak, finally felt safe. ""It was as if God himself appointed them as our saviours,"" Sudeep said later. The men were soon in bustling Lagos, waiting for a flight to Mumbai. Alone for the first time in his hotel room, Sudeep poured himself a cold beer, ran a bath and examined his scars. A pirate had inflicted a fresh wound with a fish cleaver on his shoulder a few days before, which stung as he gingerly lowered himself into the steaming bath. An Indian diplomat had given him a packet of cigarettes and over the next hour, he smoked 12 of them one after the other, staring at the ceiling as the water around him slowly cooled. It's been eight months since the men were released. Suniti, wearing a yellow sari, sits on the kitchen floor, rolling chapatis on a round block of wood. A few metres away her husband watches the Indian cricket team play New Zealand on TV. ""Sudeeeeeeep!"" Suniti calls her son to come downstairs and eat but it sounds like a cry of yearning, as though she's checking he's still here. He lost more than 20kg in the 70 days that he spent in the jungle and returned with sunken cheeks. His mother weighed him every few days for the first month, feeling buoyed with each kilo gained. Bhagyashree passes her mother-in-law a metal plate, her red and gold wedding bangles sliding down her arm as she does so. ""I was confident he would return,"" she says. ""It's just the start for us, so how can I spend life without him? I believed in the Almighty - that he would come, that he had to come. Nothing can end like this."" They finally got married in January. The couple have their own space upstairs, but every evening the four of them eat as a family in the small living room on the ground floor. On this night cousin Swapna - who campaigned ferociously for Sudeep's release - is visiting, and sings a 1960s Bollywood love song after dinner. Back in his tight-knit family and community, Sudeep appears to have found stability. He is working at the local maritime college, teaching young sailors about safety at sea, although he has put his own ocean-faring days behind him. He shows flashes of joy with his family and friends, but it's hard to tell what mark months in a pirates' den has left behind. They rarely talk about it. ""The trauma is still there,"" he tells me, as we drive around the dark streets of Bhubaneswar with pop music playing on the car speaker. ""But it's okay. I got married and all my friends and family are here... If I go to the sea then that thing will come again in my mind."" The ordeal is over but Sudeep and the other men remain tangled in a bureaucratic mess to try to get someone to take responsibility for what happened to them. Since returning, they have not received their salaries, nor any compensation. Sudeep reckons he's owed close to $10,000 in wages for the more than seven months he spent on the ship and in captivity. Capt Christos did not respond to detailed questions about the kidnapping, whether he disputed that he owed Sudeep money and about the fate of the Ghanaian man left behind with the pirates. He said in an email: ""All the kidnapped personnel was safely released and return [sic] to their homes, thanks to Owners ONLY!"" The company continues to deny that the Apecus was involved in the purchase of illegal oil, and instead argues it was at Bonny Island for repairs and to pick up supplies. A court case is pending in Nigeria. What happened to Sudeep underscores the vulnerability of those who find themselves in trouble or exploited at sea - a frontier where regulations and labour protections in theory exist but are difficult to enforce. Seafarers are on the front line of global trade - Nigerian oil ends up at petrol stations across Western Europe, including the UK, as well as India and other parts of Asia. Stories like Sudeep's, of which there are many, also reflect the human cost of security failings in the Gulf of Guinea. Unlike Somalia, Nigeria - the largest economy in Africa - will not allow international navies to patrol its waters. After all he's been through, it seems cruel that Sudeep should need to go through another fight. But he says that he wants to pursue it until the end. ""I faced this and that means I can face anything in my life,"" he says on another late-night drive. ""No-one can break me down mentally. Because for me it's a second birth, I'm living another life."" I ask him if it really feels that way. ""It's not feeling that - itismy second life,"" he replies. We park outside his house - it's past 11pm but the lights are still on inside. Bhagyashree and his parents are waiting.

"This is the start - the country's doors being edged open a crack. More time in the fresh air for exercise everywhere this week, and a timetable of a sort from Boris Johnson for an achingly gradual return to a recognisable life. In England at least, if you work in construction or manufacturing, or can't do your job from home, you'll be encouraged to go back to work as long as you can keep your distance from others this week. You'll be able, from Wednesday too, to take unlimited exercise; to meet one person from outside your own household as long as you stay two metres apart; you can go and sit in your local park, to sunbathe, or to take part in sport with others from your household. But importantly there will be NO change for the many people who are more vulnerable to the disease who are therefore ""shielding"". But progress beyond the next few days is a series of big ifs. The ambition is to start bringing back some primary school years from the start of June, but it depends how the outbreak progresses. The plan is for some secondary school pupils to be able to see their teachers occasionally before the end of the term. But there is no intention though to reopen them before the summer. There is a hope that from July, some parts of the hospitality trade might be able to open up. But don't take that to mean that pubs will be back in business - rather some limited firms that are able to trade outdoors could be allowed to return. ""If"" was the word the prime minister said again and again. The difficult reality for the government though, and for the public trying to understand what these next phases of the pandemic look like, is that different parts of our social life, different parts of the public sector, and different parts of the economy have to move at different paces because there are different levels of risk. But despite the prime minister's lengthy address there are as many questions raised as answered. Workers in some sectors have been advised to go to work on Monday but told to avoid public transport. What are employers meant to be telling their staff? What are workers meant to do if their only way of getting to work is by limited public transport? What should the parents of secondary school pupils do if they can go back to work, but their children have no prospect of a proper return? There was no mention of face coverings, even though the government has been talking about them being a possible part of their plans. Nor was there a fixed date or detail of when people travelling to the UK by plane will be asked to go into some kind of quarantine. Importantly for so many members of the public, there was vanishingly little detail of when people might be able to see their extended families again. And the prime minister's approach is also creating a very real political tension between Westminster and the devolved administrations. LOCKDOWN:How will it change now? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? With what are thought to be higher rates of the infection in Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have made no bones about their reluctance to move from the ""stay at home"" message. The governments have been trying to stick together in the last few weeks but there is very obvious division now - not just over the message and communication, but over the attitude to the workplace. Any clash like that creates confusion and uncertainty too. This is what the prime minister described as the ""sketch of a plan"" - sketches are rough, and can easily be rubbed out. And it's dependent, at every stage, on how this relatively unknown disease progresses throughout the country. On Monday a document of 50 pages or so will be published that will answer some of Sunday night's questions. The prime minister's statement was designed to try to reassure, to show the country that there is the beginning of a way out of this crisis. Yet it has prompted questions and provided only limited answers.

"Coronavirus lockdown advice has not changed in Wales, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has repeated It follows the prime minister's announcement of changes to the rules in England Many pregnant women have been wrongly sent home on sick pay or unpaid leave during the coronavirus crisis, a Welsh MP has claimed Plaid Cymru has called for Wales to send a stay at home message ""loudly and clearly"" to save lives Public Health Wales has announced an additional 12 deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 1,111 PHW also confirmed an additional 223 cases, bringing the Welsh total to 11,344 Rachel Flint and Richard Porter As we bring today's live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in Wales to a close, here's a summary of the main developments:  The live updates team will be back in the morning with the latest.  James WilliamsBBC Wales Political Correspondent It wasn't clear from the prime minister's broadcast, but aside from the imposition of quarantine ""on people coming into this country by air"" the rest of the lockdown changes he announced will only apply in England. But, of course, Boris Johnson is the prime minister for the whole of the United Kingdom so his speech is obviously for a wider audience. It's complicated. Ultimately, on the big ticket changes the prime minister has decided to keep England pretty much aligned with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - for now, at least. But differences in messaging, slogans and changes around the margins could potentially cause problems for Welsh ministers. Having heard the prime minister's address, is everyone in Bristol who fancies driving to Powys to walk in the Brecon Beacons going to know that the rules are different in Wales? A Welsh Government source said ""people need clear communication"" and they may now end up ""wasting time"" clarifying the different regulations on either side of the border. NHS staff have said they feel ""stabbed in the back"" by people breaking lockdown guidelines to hold VE Day street parties in Wales. People had been advised not to hold public gatherings on Friday to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe. However, some scenes of celebrations and partieshave been criticised by doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients. ""I'm worried that in ten days' time we're right back to where we started,"" said intensive care consultant Ami Jones. Boris Johnson laid out his government's next steps to ease lockdown this evening - but Wales' approach had already been announced on Friday.
So what's the situation here? This video can not be played Who makes which decisions when it comes to coronavirus? With many policy responsibilities devolved to Wales - across areas including health, social care and education - there are decisions which are in the in-trays of Welsh Government ministers. But other issues, like the furlough scheme, and quarantine for travellers arriving in the UK - are decisions for the UK Government. So here's a reminder ofwho does what. Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent Most schools in Wales have been shut since the end of March The UK labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, says the prime ministerâs statement lacked âclarity and consensusâ. He told the BBC: âThis statement raises as many questions as it answers. We see the prospect of England, Scotland and Wales pulling in different directions, so there's a big gap here for the government to make up.â He says that if he were PM, he would have âtried to build a consensusâ and would have made sure - if possible - that the devolved administrations, trade unions, and community groups were âon boardâ and knew âexactly what was required of them.â Sir Keir leader adds: âI accept a plan had to be set out, but to lack that basic clarity and consensus is a real problem.â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Boris Johnson has made a
""reckless move"". Speaking on a specialBBC Wales Todayprogramme, Mr Price
said the prime minister's strategy signalled ""the end of the four nation approach"" to the UK. ""We now have a
three nation approach from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with a simple
clear stay at home message. England has signalled a move away from that,"" he added. ""The Stay Alert message is confusing. It's the wrong
decision for England but is also sending a mixed message and makes our work here [in Wales] harder.""  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is concerned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was not clear enough in his address that he was talking mainly about changes in England. ""I think it is incumbent on him, perhaps a bit more strongly than he did tonight, to stress that when he is talking about lifting these restrictions, he is talking for England,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""When he talks about things like border control, he is talking for the whole UK, but really all of us have a duty right now to be as clear as possible and, having watched the prime minister, I think there is still some room for some simpler messages."" In the past half hour, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spoken about changes to lockdown in England. So what did he announce?  The lockdown situation in Wales is different.'Modest' changes to the rules herewere announced First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has relaxed the exercise rules in England saying can people âdrive to other destinations"" for a walk. But the Welsh Government's Counsel General Jeremy Miles has said this is not the case in Wales. ""Our regulations do not permit people to get in their car and drive to destinations in Wales,""  said Mr Miles. ""And that also means people getting in their cars in England."" Mr Miles says the police in Wales ""absolutely have the power to fine"" people for making non-essential journeys and not exercising near their homes. Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams has made it clear that the situation regarding education in Wales has not changed sinceher statement last Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

The rules in Wales don't permit you to drive long distances for leisure, the Welsh Government's Counsel General Jeremy Miles has confirmed, with police having the power to issue fines. Here's a reminder of thelockdown rules in Wales.  Boris Johnson says the next step from Wednesday will be to âencourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exerciseâ in England. He says: âYou can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.â But he warns people âmust obey the rules on social distancingâ and to enforce them, the fines police can give out will be increased. Johnson says, âwith ever increasing dataâ and being able to track progress, âif we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.â Boris Johnson says there will be five alert levels in the new system for England, with level one meaning the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five being âthe most critical â the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmedâ. The PM says there as been a period at level four during the lockdown, but âthanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level threeâ. However, he says âeveryone will have a role to play in keeping the R downâ¦ by staying alert and following the rules.â And he adds there are two more things to do âto keep pushing the number of infections downâ. âWe must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. âAnd if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.â Boris Johnsontells people to ""stay alert""as he outlines steps to modify measures in England. It comes after he unveiled an alert system to rank the threat level of coronavirus in England. The UK government is replacing the ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan with ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"". The ""stay at home"" advice will remain in place inScotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandleaders in the three devolved nations said Mr Johnson had not consulted them on the new message. The coronavirus lockdown advice has not changed in Wales despite  Boris Johnson's address,the First Minister has said. The prime minister laid out England's coronavirus response for the next three weeks. However in Wales,new rules allowing people to exercise more oftenand for garden centres to open,
if they can comply with social distancing, will come into effect tomorrow. Mr Drakeford said people should remain at home ""wherever you can""  because coronavirus ""has not gone away"". ""If you need to leave home for work, exercise or shopping, you
should stay local and stay alert,"" he added. ""The way we behave over the weeks ahead will continue to have a
profound impact on our NHS and our ability to save lives."" Mr Drakeford said any plans for the future depend upon how the virus behaves over the coming weeks and months. However he reaffirmed that schools will not return to normal
on 1 June. He added: ""We will continue to make decisions, which are right for Wales,
using information and expert advice about how coronavirus is circulating here
to keep us safe."" Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts has tweeted her response to Boris Johnson's statement so far: Allow Twitter content?

The PM reiterates the governmentâs five tests for ending lockdown in England: protecting the NHS, seeing a sustained fall in death rates, a fall in the rate of infection, sorting out âchallengesâ - such as procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) - and stopping the so-called R number rising up over one and causing âexponential growthâ of the virus. He says we âcannot move forward unless we satisfy the five testsâ. Johnson announces the previewed plans by launching a new âCovid Alert Systemâ which, he says, will be run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. He says the level the country is at will be determined primarily by the R number and the number of coronavirus cases, and âwill tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measuresâ, namely âthe lower the level, the fewer the measures, the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to beâ.

"For Sudeep Choudhury, work on merchant ships promised adventure and a better life. But a voyage on an oil tanker in West Africa, in dangerous seas far from home, would turn the young graduate's life upside down. His fate would come to depend on a band of drug-fuelled jungle pirates - and the whims of a mysterious figure called The King. The MT Apecus dropped anchor off Nigeria's Bonny Island shortly after sunrise. Sudeep Choudhury was at the end of a draining shift on deck. Looking towards land, he could make out dozens of other ships. On the shoreline beyond them, a column of white oil storage tanks rose out of the ground like giants. He had breakfast and then made two phone calls. One to his parents - he knew they worried about him, their only child - and one to his fiancee, Bhagyashree. He told her that everything was going to plan and that he would call her again later that day. He then clambered into bed for a sleep. It was 19 April, 2019. The small, ageing oil tanker and its crew of 15 had spent two days sailing south from the port of Lagos to the Niger Delta, where oil was discovered in the 1950s by Dutch and British businessmen seeking a swift fortune. Although he knew that vicious pirates roamed the labyrinthine wetlands and mangroves of the delta, Sudeep felt safe that tropical South Atlantic morning. Nigerian navy boats were patrolling and the Apecus was moored just outside Bonny, seven nautical miles from land, waiting for permission to enter port. The warm waters of the Gulf of Guinea, which lap across the coastline of seven West African nations, are the most dangerous in the world. It used to be Somalia, but now this area is the epicentre of modern sea piracy. Of all the seafarers held for ransom globally last year, some 90% were taken here. Sixty-four people were seized from six ships in just the last three months of 2019, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks such incidents. Many more attacks may have gone unreported. The bountiful oil found here could have made the people of the delta rich, but for most it has been a curse. Spills have poisoned the water and the land, and a fight over the spoils of the industry has fuelled violent crime and conflict for decades. In the villages above the pipelines that have netted billions for the Nigerian government and international oil companies, life expectancy is about 45 years. Militant groups with comic book names like the Niger Delta Avengers have blown up pipelines and crippled production to demand the redistribution of wealth and resources. Oil thieves siphon off thick black crude and process it in makeshift refineries hidden in the forest. The level of violence in the delta ebbs and flows - but the threat is always there. Sudeep woke up a few hours later to yelling and banging. The watchman in the ship's command room, high above the deck, had spotted an approaching speedboat carrying nine heavily-armed men. His cry of warning ricocheted around the 80m-long ship as the crew scrambled. They couldn't stop the pirates, but they could at least try to hide. Sudeep, just 28 but the ship's third officer, was in charge of the five other Indian crew working on the Apecus. There was no oil on board, so he knew the pirates would want to take human cargo for ransom. Americans and Europeans are highly prized because their companies pay the highest ransoms but in reality, most sailors come from the developing world. On the Apecus, the Indians were the only non-Africans. With less than five minutes to act, Sudeep gathered his men in the engine room in the bowels of the ship before running upstairs to set off an emergency alarm that would notify everyone on board. On his way back down, he realised he was only wearing the underwear he had gone to sleep in. Then he caught his first glimpse of  the attackers, who were wearing T-shirts and black face coverings, and brandishing assault rifles. They were alongside the vessel, confidently hooking a ladder onto the side. The Indians decided to hide in a small storeroom, where they crouched among lights, wires and other electrical supplies, and tried to still their panicked breathing. The pirates were soon prowling around outside, their voices echoing above the low hum of engine machinery. The sailors were trembling but stayed silent. Many ships that sail in the Gulf of Guinea invest in safe rooms with bullet-proof walls where crews can take shelter in exactly this kind of situation. The Apecus didn't have one. The men heard footsteps approaching and the bolt slid open with a clang. Get up. The pirates fired at the floor and a bullet fragment struck Sudeep in his left shin, lodging itself just an inch from the bone. The men marched the sailors outside and up onto the deck. They knew they had to move very quickly. The captain had put out a distress call and the gunshots might have been heard by other ships. The attackers ordered the Indians to climb down a ladder onto the waiting speedboat, which had two engines for extra speed. Chirag, a nervous 22-year-old on his first deployment at sea, was the first to comply. With the pirates' guns trained on them the others followed, as did the captain. The six hostages - five Indians and one Nigerian - squatted uncomfortably on the overcrowded boat as it began to motor away. The remaining crew, including one Indian who had managed to evade the attackers, emerged onto the deck. They watched as the pirates sped off towards the delta with their blindfolded captives, leaving the Apecus floating in the tide. The text message from the shipping agent arrived in the middle of the night. Dear Sir, understandably Sudeep's vessel has been hijacked. The Greek owner is co-ordinating the matter. Don't get panicky. No harm will come to Sudeep. Please keep patience. Pradeep Choudhury and his wife Suniti, sitting in their bedroom, were left reeling by this perfunctory message. They had spoken to their son just hours earlier. Pradeep began forwarding the text to family members and Sudeep's closest friends. Could this really be true? Had anyone heard from their son? Sudeep, as anyone who knows him will say, was mischievous growing up. He was restless, always wanting to get out of the house for an adventure. And his parents, especially his mother, would constantly worry about him. They have lived in Bhubaneswar, a small city in the state of Odisha on India's eastern coast, for most of Sudeep's life. It's a place that Indians living in the centres of power and influence - Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore - rarely, if ever, think about, but running a small photocopying shop from the front of their home gave the Choudhurys a comfortable life. On the busy pavements near their home in central Bhubaneswar, the faces of deities stare out from modest shrines. But before he left for Africa, Sudeep didn't really believe in any kind of god. Life would be what he and Bhagyashree could make of it. They met when they were teenagers. Now a software engineer, she has the air of a girl who would have been popular at school. The couple are the kind of aspirational young Indians whose dreams far eclipse the stable, traditional family lives that their parents craved. There are tens of millions like them in India, armed with degrees and certificates but coming of age in a lumbering economy that continues to churn out many more graduates than well-paying jobs. For Sudeep, a job in merchant shipping promised an escape from all of that. He was lured by stories of good money, plenty of work and a chance to see the world. And he's not alone - after Filipinos and Indonesians, Indians make up the largest contingent of global seafarers, working as deckhands, cooks, engineers and officers. Some 234,000 of them sailed on foreign-flagged vessels in 2019. But getting the right qualifications is complicated and Sudeep studied for five years, set on a path that cost his family thousands of dollars. At the age of 27, he finally qualified as a third officer and got a tattoo on his right forearm to celebrate: a little sailing boat bobbing on a cluster of triangles representing the sea, with a large anchor cutting straight through the middle like a dagger. On the first morning after the sailors were kidnapped, dozens of men emerged from the forest and fired their guns into the sky for nearly half an hour to celebrate. The five Indians, who had been left on a car-sized wooden platform floating on a mangrove swamp, stared hopelessly at the brown water below them. To get to their jungle prison they had been taken on a snaking, hours-long boat ride through the waterways of the delta. In those first days, the message from the pirates - reinforced with occasional beatings - was clear: if no-one pays a ransom, we will kill you. Sudeep was still living in his underwear and itched all night under buzzing mosquitoes that left his skin dotted with bites. He hadn't been given a bandage for the wound on his leg, so he had pushed mud into the hole. The humidity of the jungle meant the men were never dry. They shared a single dirty mat for a bed, and would snatch brief minutes of sleep before jolting awake and remembering where they were. Early on, the pirates had dragged a skeleton up from the swamp to show the sailors what had supposedly become of a former hostage whose boss had refused to pay. That wasn't the only macabre threat. On another day, they were shown a pile of concrete blocks. Try anything and we'll strap these to your legs and drop you in the ocean, the pirates told them. A rotating cast of guards kept watch from the riverbank, 10 or so metres away. They spent their time fishing, smoking marijuana and drinking a local spirit made from palm sap called kai-kai - but they also watched the hostages closely, occasionally training a gun on them and yelling out a warning, as if their captives might suddenly dive into the murky water and swim away. Over time, Sudeep would try to strike up a relationship with some of these men. He would gently ask them how they were, or if they had children. But the response was always silence, or a blunt warning.Don't talk to us.They appeared to be under strict orders but never referred to their leader - who seemed to be based elsewhere in the jungle - by name. He was just ""The King"". Sudeep and the other men - Chirag, 22, Ankit, 21, Avinash, 22, and Moogu, 34 - had little choice but to try to conserve their energy and wait for something to happen. Their lives fell into a kind of lethargic routine. Once a day, normally in mid-morning, they would get a bowl of instant noodles to share between the five of them. They would carefully ration the meal, passing around a grimy spoon and each taking one mouthful. They would repeat the ritual in the evening and hand back the empty bowl. They were given nothing to drink except muddy water, which was often mixed with petrol. Sometimes they were so thirsty they drank saltwater from the river. The Nigerian captain was kept separately in a hut nearby. He was treated better and the Indians began to loathe him for it. To pass time, the five men would talk about their lives back home and their plans for the future. They would watch the nature around them - snakes slithering up trees, birds taking flight through the mangroves. They would pray. If the pirates spotted a monkey, the quiet would be broken. The Indians would watch them scramble after it, spraying the animal with bullets. It would later be cooked over a bonfire but the meat was never shared with them. The sailors tried to keep track of each passing sunset by etching small arrows into the wooden planks that they slept on. They were at times delirious - some of them, including Sudeep, contracted malaria. In whispers, they would imagine a scenario where the pirates came to kill them and they fought back. If they were going to die, they could probably kill at least three of them on the way down, right? At moments like this they laughed, but it was a constant battle not to sink into despair. During the many quiet hours in which they would simply lie under the beating sun, Sudeep would think over and over what he could do to get them out, and what he would tell the Indian High Commission or his family if he got a chance to call. In his head, he was still trying to plan his wedding. The pirates' initial demand was for a ransom of several million dollars. It was an exorbitant sum and one they must have known was unlikely to be paid. But these kinds of ransom kidnappings involve complex and drawn-out negotiations, and in the undiscoverable warrens of the Niger Delta, time always seemed to be on their side. About 15 days after the attack, the pirates took Sudeep on a boat to another part of the forest, and handed him a satellite phone so he could appeal directly to the ship owner, a Greek businessman based in the Mediterranean port of Piraeus called Captain Christos Traios. His company, Petrogress Inc, operates several oil tankers in West Africa with swashbuckling names like the Optimus and the Invictus. Sudeep knew little about Capt Christos but had heard he was an aggressive, bad-tempered man. ""Sir, this is terrible. We are in a very bad condition. And I need you to act very fast because we might die here,"" he told him. His boss, furious about what had happened, was apparently unmoved. The pirates were incensed. ""We just want money,"" they would say over and over again. ""But if your people don't give us money, we will kill you."" Their business model is dependent on the compliance of ship bosses who, usually covered by insurance, will pay significant amounts to free their crew after weeks of negotiations. But in this case they were up against a stubborn ship owner. The key now, the kidnappers knew, would be to reach the families. Back in India, Sudeep's parents spent their nights lying awake. They knew so little about what had happened that their minds veered towards the worst in those hours before dawn broke, when the streets of Bhubaneswar would briefly be still. They feared their son would never emerge from a pirates' den that they could scarcely imagine. There was no way the family could afford to pay the pirates directly and it was never considered as a serious option. The Indian government doesn't pay ransoms but they hoped it would help them in other ways - by assisting the Nigerian navy to find the pirate camp, or forcing the ship owner to pay up. Bhagyashree and Swapna, a formidable cousin of Sudeep in her mid-30s, took charge of this effort. They corralled the family members of the kidnapped men into a WhatsApp group so they could co-ordinate efforts to get their boys freed. It soon became clear to Bhagyashree that the pirates would gain nothing by killing the sailors. But she was nervous about how long their patience would last. Pressuring the ship owner from all directions seemed the only feasible way to get her fiancee out.  And so in the car, in the bathroom stall at work, and at home lying in bed, she was online, tweeting, firing off pleading emails to anyone who might be able to help. After three weeks of near-silence, on day 17, the families had a breakthrough. A sister of one of the kidnapped men, Avinash, received a call from her brother in the Nigerian jungle. He told her that all the men were alive but they really needed help. The other families would go on to receive calls from their sons in the coming days - but not Bhagyashree and the Choudhurys. Strange relationships began to be forged. A relative of one of the sailors who works in the shipping industry, a man called Captain Nasib, began calling the pirates regularly on their satellite phone to check on the men's condition. But the tinny audio recordings he posted in the WhatsApp chat did not reassure the families. The ship owner ""does not care"" about the lives of his men and is ""playing around"", a pirate angrily told Capt Nasib in one phone call. On 17 May 2019 - day 28 - the pirates gave Sudeep the chance to speak to Capt Nasib, who assured him that the ordeal would only last a few more days. But Sudeep, as the ranking officer, was told he had to keep everyone's morale high in the meantime. ""I'm trying,"" Sudeep can be heard responding in Hindi in a crackly recording of the call. ""Tell my family that you talked to me."" Every few weeks the Indians were moved from one jungle lair to another. As negotiations with Capt Christos seemingly broke down, The King himself began to visit them. He would never say much, but the other pirates treated him with a reverence that suggested fear. His status as the group's leader almost seemed a consequence of his sheer size. All the pirates were muscle-bound and threatening but The King was especially hulking - at least 6ft 6in. He carried a much larger gun than the men under his command, and a leather belt filled with bullets was always strapped around his massive frame. He would turn up every four or five days and calmly smoke some marijuana before the captives. He would say that Capt Christos was still not playing ball and that this would have consequences. The King spoke deliberately, and with better English than the other men. After many weeks in captivity, the sailors were becoming bony and thin; their eyes were a pale yellow and their urine was at times blood-red. Each visit from the King felt like it brought them closer to the fate of the skeleton they had seen pulled from the mud. Then events took a more bizarre turn. Up until this point, what had happened to the Apecus seemed to be just another opportunistic ransom kidnapping. But in late May, unbeknown to the men who sat festering on those planks in the swamp, machinations were unfolding that seemed to point to a far more complex series of events. The Nigerian navy had publicly accused the tanker company of being involved in the transport of stolen crude oil from the Niger Delta to Ghana. The attack on the Apecus and the kidnapping, according to the navy, had actually been provoked by a disagreement between two criminal groups. There had even been arrests. The ship company's manager in Nigeria had apparently confessed to being involved in illicit oil trading. Capt Christos, the ship's owner, fervently denied this. In emails seen by the BBC, he blamed the Indian government for getting the Nigerian navy to detain his vessels and staff in order to force him to ""negotiate with terrorists"" and pay an ""incredible"" ransom. Indian authorities dispute this version of events. The Nigerian Navy didn't comment. It was a precarious situation for the captives. But the accusations - which put Capt Christos's tanker operations in Nigeria at risk - did seem to spur him to reach a resolution with the pirates. And so on 13 June, Sudeep's family finally learned from a government source that negotiations were complete and that payment was being arranged. At the same time, the sailors in the jungle were told that their ordeal might be coming to an end. The men woke up on the morning of 29 June 2019 like they had almost every day for the previous 70 days. At mid-morning, after handing over the bowl of noodles, one of the guards beckoned Sudeep over and whispered that if things worked out, this could be his last day in the jungle. Two hours later the guard returned with confirmation: the man bringing the money was on his way. The frail Ghanaian man in his mid-60s who approached in a boat that afternoon, nervously clutching a heavy plastic bag with US dollars peeking out of the top, did not look like a seasoned negotiator. Within minutes of his arrival, it was clear something was not right. A group of pirates began beating the old man. The King, bellowing about the money being short, pulled a small knife out of his belt and stabbed him in the leg, leaving him writhing on the muddy ground. He then approached the Indians and told them that while the Ghanaian would be staying, all six captives were free to go. His men wouldn't stop them, but if another pirate group picked them up, they were on their own. He looked Sudeep in the eye: ""Bye-bye."" The men did not hesitate. They ran to the water's edge, where the fishing boat that had brought the bag man was parked. Sudeep told the driver to take them where he had come from. After more than two months he was still in his underwear, though the pirates had given him a torn T-shirt to wear. The boat rocked unsteadily from side to side as it motored away. After nearly four hours, the driver said he was out of fuel and stopped at a jetty. In the distance, on the outskirts of a small village, a group of barefoot men were playing football. The ragged sailors approached them. When they explained they had been kidnapped, they were ushered into a house and given bottles of water which they gulped down one after the other. Three of the village's biggest men kept guard outside the guesthouse they were housed in during the night. The Indians, though weak, finally felt safe. ""It was as if God himself appointed them as our saviours,"" Sudeep said later. The men were soon in bustling Lagos, waiting for a flight to Mumbai. Alone for the first time in his hotel room, Sudeep poured himself a cold beer, ran a bath and examined his scars. A pirate had inflicted a fresh wound with a fish cleaver on his shoulder a few days before, which stung as he gingerly lowered himself into the steaming bath. An Indian diplomat had given him a packet of cigarettes and over the next hour, he smoked 12 of them one after the other, staring at the ceiling as the water around him slowly cooled. It's been eight months since the men were released. Suniti, wearing a yellow sari, sits on the kitchen floor, rolling chapatis on a round block of wood. A few metres away her husband watches the Indian cricket team play New Zealand on TV. ""Sudeeeeeeep!"" Suniti calls her son to come downstairs and eat but it sounds like a cry of yearning, as though she's checking he's still here. He lost more than 20kg in the 70 days that he spent in the jungle and returned with sunken cheeks. His mother weighed him every few days for the first month, feeling buoyed with each kilo gained. Bhagyashree passes her mother-in-law a metal plate, her red and gold wedding bangles sliding down her arm as she does so. ""I was confident he would return,"" she says. ""It's just the start for us, so how can I spend life without him? I believed in the Almighty - that he would come, that he had to come. Nothing can end like this."" They finally got married in January. The couple have their own space upstairs, but every evening the four of them eat as a family in the small living room on the ground floor. On this night cousin Swapna - who campaigned ferociously for Sudeep's release - is visiting, and sings a 1960s Bollywood love song after dinner. Back in his tight-knit family and community, Sudeep appears to have found stability. He is working at the local maritime college, teaching young sailors about safety at sea, although he has put his own ocean-faring days behind him. He shows flashes of joy with his family and friends, but it's hard to tell what mark months in a pirates' den has left behind. They rarely talk about it. ""The trauma is still there,"" he tells me, as we drive around the dark streets of Bhubaneswar with pop music playing on the car speaker. ""But it's okay. I got married and all my friends and family are here... If I go to the sea then that thing will come again in my mind."" The ordeal is over but Sudeep and the other men remain tangled in a bureaucratic mess to try to get someone to take responsibility for what happened to them. Since returning, they have not received their salaries, nor any compensation. Sudeep reckons he's owed close to $10,000 in wages for the more than seven months he spent on the ship and in captivity. Capt Christos did not respond to detailed questions about the kidnapping, whether he disputed that he owed Sudeep money and about the fate of the Ghanaian man left behind with the pirates. He said in an email: ""All the kidnapped personnel was safely released and return [sic] to their homes, thanks to Owners ONLY!"" The company continues to deny that the Apecus was involved in the purchase of illegal oil, and instead argues it was at Bonny Island for repairs and to pick up supplies. A court case is pending in Nigeria. What happened to Sudeep underscores the vulnerability of those who find themselves in trouble or exploited at sea - a frontier where regulations and labour protections in theory exist but are difficult to enforce. Seafarers are on the front line of global trade - Nigerian oil ends up at petrol stations across Western Europe, including the UK, as well as India and other parts of Asia. Stories like Sudeep's, of which there are many, also reflect the human cost of security failings in the Gulf of Guinea. Unlike Somalia, Nigeria - the largest economy in Africa - will not allow international navies to patrol its waters. After all he's been through, it seems cruel that Sudeep should need to go through another fight. But he says that he wants to pursue it until the end. ""I faced this and that means I can face anything in my life,"" he says on another late-night drive. ""No-one can break me down mentally. Because for me it's a second birth, I'm living another life."" I ask him if it really feels that way. ""It's not feeling that - itismy second life,"" he replies. We park outside his house - it's past 11pm but the lights are still on inside. Bhagyashree and his parents are waiting.

"Anti-vax videos have been widely shared online We've been fact-checking the most widely shared dubious coronavirus claims this week. First, we've looked at a widely shared video posted on YouTube that claims changes introduced in UK law give the government the power to enforce vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Under current UK law, however, this is not the case - vaccines are not compulsory. The presenter of the video has a copy of thePublic Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984,external, which applies in England and Wales. This legislation gives the government powers to prevent, control or mitigate the spread of an infection or contamination. However, it explicitly states that regulationscannot require a person to undertake medical treatment, including vaccination,external. The Coronavirus Act,externalintroduced in March 2020 extended this prohibition to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The current legislation ""makes explicitly clear that the power to make such regulations does not include mandatory treatment or vaccination,external"", says Louise Hooper, a barrister at Garden Court Chambers in London. Where we're at with a vaccine Why are people sceptical about vaccines? The video also claims the government has sweeping powers to detain people believed to be infectious with the virus. It's true there are powers in existing UK law to prevent the spread of disease, such as requiring someone to self-isolate if potentially infectious. ""These are wide-ranging, however, there are important limitations on all of these powers,"" says Louise Hooper. The person must be told why they are being told to isolate, it's limited to 14 days and can be appealed against to a magistrate. This can sometimes be extended but then must be reviewed every 24 hours. In the jargon of this next widely shared video, the global Covid-19 pandemic is a ""plandemic"", suggesting it was a planned event. So popular has this online film become that the term was, for a while, a top-trending search in the US. It has clocked up millions of views - #Plandemic has been tweeted tens of thousands of times. The video is filled with medical misinformation about the origins of the virus and how it is spread. It contains an interview with researcher Judy Mikovits, well-known for her anti-vaccination activism, who claims Covid-19 was not ""naturally occurring"" and was ""manipulated"" in a laboratory. This is a widely shared idea,but there is no scientific evidence for it. Several versions of the film have been removed by YouTube, which says the video has ""content that includes medically unsubstantiated diagnostic advice for Covid-19"". Other social networks have also been taking it down. Despite these efforts to remove it, users have been widely re-posting the video. Along with a host of false health claims (such as treating patients with hot water, Vitamin C and sunshine), another video, this one viewed more than a million times on YouTube also claims that a patent for the genome sequence of the new coronavirus was taken out long before the latest outbreak began. This rumour has been swirling around online for months, suggesting the release of a previously known virus. However, the ""coronavirus patent"" referred to in the video was one that was applied for in 2006 for the genome sequence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) - a different type of coronavirus.  The application was ultimately not pursued. The video then refers to the existence of a patent for a ""coronavirus vaccine"" - one held by the British-based Pirbright Institute. The video fails to mention that this is linked to a different coronavirus that affects poultry. The Pirbright Institute receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This has contributed to the baseless but widespread online rumours that Bill Gates holds a patent for a Covid-19 vaccine. No, Bernie.

How bad information goes viral The big rap singalong that never happened We've looked previously at a herbal tea being promoted by President Andry Rajoelina of the island nation of Madagascar as atreatment for coronavirus. The drink, produced under the name Covid Organics, is now being widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa despite a lack of scientific testing. Among those pinning their hopes on the tonic is Tanzania's president John Magufuli, whoordered a plane to the island to pick up supplies, as have Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Authorities in Gabon and Comoros have also expressed intentions to import Covid Organics to use as a remedy. And the Covid-19 task force in the Democratic Republic of Congo have said they intend to produce their own treatment using Covid Organics as a base. The WHO has issued a warning in response to the production of the Covid Organics drink, that all traditional remedies and plants should be tested for efficacy and adverse side-effects. ""Africans deserve to use medicines tested to the same standards as people in the rest of the world,"" it said in a statement.

"The Northern Ireland Executive says it will ""consider its plan for a phased, strategic approach to recovery"" at a meeting on Monday. A statement from First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill was issued on Sunday night. Politicians in NI had emphasised the ""stay at home message"" ahead of the prime minister's address on Sunday. The executive has already extended lockdown in NI until 28 May. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill took part in a Cobra call on Sunday afternoon with the prime minister. On Sunday evening,Boris Johnson unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society,allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mrs Foster said on Sunday evening ""we have flattened the curve of infection, reduced the R rate to below one and protected our health service but we are not out of the woods yet"". Arlene Foster said the message on the whole remained to ""stay at home"" ""It is important that we continue to follow this advice,"" she added. ""As the executive begins to finalise our plans for recovery, we need to strike the balance between continuing to protect lives and the health service and give people hope for the future. ""The changes that we will introduce will be gradual, proportionate and based on scientific and medical advice and will be taken at the right time and in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland."" Ms O'Neill said ""we are at a critical stage in the fight against the virus and so our recovery must be phased, gradual and strategic"". She added: ""The decisions this executive will take in the days and weeks ahead are some of the biggest we will ever have to make. ""We know that six weeks into the restrictions, people need some light at the end of the tunnel. ""We also know that recovery will only happen one step at a time, to do otherwise risks undermining the sacrifices people have already made and increases the risk of a second spike in the future."" Health officials in England have changed their message to ""stay alert"" with regard to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. In NI, the message remains the same. Earlier on Sunday, Mrs Foster said the message on the whole remained to ""stay at home"". She added Northern Ireland will have a ""road map"" for moving out of lockdown at the beginning of the week. She said people in Northern Ireland had complied with the social distancing regulations although ""compliance is beginning to fray"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Health Minister Robin Swann both tweeted ""stay at home"" messages on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that in a cross-party call with the prime minister on Sunday, he had expressed concerns about the ""stay alert"" message. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he felt the message ""doesn't make any sense and nobody will understand it"". ""I said very clearly to Boris Johnson, it's not a burglar we are worried about it's a virus,"" he added. Colum Eastwood said he felt the ""stay alert"" message ""does not make any sense"" And Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""It is our strong belief that now is not the time to change the message or direction. ""Until the R rate is reduced we must continue to keep staying home, keep protecting our NHS & above all, keep saving lives."" Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said ""the message for people across Northern Ireland is to stay home, safe safe and protect our NHS"". Earlier on Sunday Scotland's First Ministerasked the UK government not to advertise its new ""stay alert"" message north of the border. Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus, #StayHomeSaveLives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage."" In Wales, the country's First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpeople should stay home ""wherever you can"". On Sunday, it was reported that five more people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in Northern Ireland. That brings the number of Covid-19 related deaths to 435, according to Department of Health figures. They show the number of people with a positive laboratory completed test is now 4,119. The total number of laboratory completed tests is 38,984. These figures are one of two sets published in Northern Ireland.

"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""Stay alert will mean stay alert, by staying home as much as possible"" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has insisted now is the right time to update the government's coronavirus message from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", amid widespread criticism. PM Boris Johnson announced the slogan for England, telling people to ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"",ahead of his national address. Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandare sticking with ""stay at home"". Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I don't know what 'stay alert' means."" The first minister added at the daily briefing in Edinburgh: ""For Scotland right now, given the fragility of the progress we've made, given the critical point that we are at, then it would be catastrophic for me to drop the 'stay at home' message. ""I am particularly not prepared to do it in favour of a message that is vague and imprecise."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warned people might be ""puzzled"" by the change. But Mr Jenrick told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""Stay alert will mean stay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out, by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others in the workplace and the other settings that you'll go to."" A further 269 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths recorded to 31,855. The number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. The government has also missed its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day for the eighth day in a row, with 92,837 tests on Saturday. PM unveils 'conditional plan' to reopen society What will be the 'new normal'? The prime minister shared the new government slogan on Twitter, detailing some of the guidance issued to the public.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. A No 10 spokesman added: ""Everyone has a role to play in keeping the rate of infection (R) down by staying alert and following the rules."" Mr Ashworth called on the government to clarify what the new slogan meant. ""When you're dealing with a public health crisis of this nature, you need absolute clarity from government about what the advice is. There is no room for nuance,"" he said. ""The problem with the new message is that many people will be puzzled by it,"" he added. Mr Jenrick said the updated message was a ""cautious"" one, because the rate of infection remained high and the public were ""understandably anxious"". He dismissed Mr Ashworth's concerns, saying: ""The public are capable of understanding a broader message as we move into the next phase of the virus."" However, the Liberal Democrats' acting leader Sir Ed Davey said changing the slogan ""makes the police's job near-impossible and may cause considerable alarm"" as he urged the government to publish the evidence that has informed the new strategy. And on social media, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham called the updated advice ""too ambiguous"" and ""unenforceable"". The UK government's new slogan is part of moving into the next phase of the response to coronavirus. Staying at home where possible will remain part of the strategy, but ministers want to ""broaden the message"". Some are worried the new campaign is ambiguous and muddies the water. In Wales and Scotland, the devolved governments who control health have made clear they will keep the original slogan - stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. So from tomorrow, messaging will be different in different parts of the UK. And I understand there are real concerns in the Scottish government about how people will react - and fears it will be harder to get them to follow their advice to stay at home unless essential. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would continue to use the ""stay at home"" message in Scotland and later said she had asked the UK government ""not to deploy"" the new slogan there.

Leaders of the devolved nations - which have the power to set their own lockdown regulations - said they had not been consulted over the ""stay alert"" message. Ms Sturgeon said the first she heard of the updated guidance was in newspaper reports. Giving Scotland's daily coronavirus briefing, she said that, other than allowing people to leave home for exercise more than once a day, the rules there had not changed. ""We remain in lockdown for now and my ask of you is to remain at home"", she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is part of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned some people might take the more generalised ""alert"" slogan as a ""green light"" to socialise. ""I do not think this is a helpful message in terms of guiding behaviour. It does not give advice as to what people should do,"" she told the PA news agency. Meanwhile, the government's pandemic response has been called ""wishy-washy"" by a body representing police officers in London. It comes after a police force in east London shared an image of a crowded park in Hackney on Saturday, where hundreds of people, they said, were eating and drinking alcohol. Police officers patrol Greenwich Park, in London, on Saturday. Ken Marsh, from the Metropolitan Police Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme authorities ""needed to be firmer right from the beginning"" and that if authorities had been more stringent from the outset ""we would have a better result now"". But another adviser to Sage, Prof Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend outdoor activities posed a ""relatively low risk"" so long as people with symptoms were not going out and that those who needed to quarantine themselves did so. In his address, the prime minister announced the launch of an alert system for tracking coronavirus in England and unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society, allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mr Johnson also said people who could not work from home should return to the workplace - but avoid public transport. The lockdown has already been extended for another three weeks in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to 28 May.

"Coronavirus lockdown advice has not changed in Wales, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has repeated It follows the prime minister's announcement of changes to the rules in England Many pregnant women have been wrongly sent home on sick pay or unpaid leave during the coronavirus crisis, a Welsh MP has claimed Plaid Cymru has called for Wales to send a stay at home message ""loudly and clearly"" to save lives Public Health Wales has announced an additional 12 deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 1,111 PHW also confirmed an additional 223 cases, bringing the Welsh total to 11,344 Rachel Flint and Richard Porter As we bring today's live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in Wales to a close, here's a summary of the main developments:  The live updates team will be back in the morning with the latest.  James WilliamsBBC Wales Political Correspondent It wasn't clear from the prime minister's broadcast, but aside from the imposition of quarantine ""on people coming into this country by air"" the rest of the lockdown changes he announced will only apply in England. But, of course, Boris Johnson is the prime minister for the whole of the United Kingdom so his speech is obviously for a wider audience. It's complicated. Ultimately, on the big ticket changes the prime minister has decided to keep England pretty much aligned with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - for now, at least. But differences in messaging, slogans and changes around the margins could potentially cause problems for Welsh ministers. Having heard the prime minister's address, is everyone in Bristol who fancies driving to Powys to walk in the Brecon Beacons going to know that the rules are different in Wales? A Welsh Government source said ""people need clear communication"" and they may now end up ""wasting time"" clarifying the different regulations on either side of the border. NHS staff have said they feel ""stabbed in the back"" by people breaking lockdown guidelines to hold VE Day street parties in Wales. People had been advised not to hold public gatherings on Friday to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe. However, some scenes of celebrations and partieshave been criticised by doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients. ""I'm worried that in ten days' time we're right back to where we started,"" said intensive care consultant Ami Jones. Boris Johnson laid out his government's next steps to ease lockdown this evening - but Wales' approach had already been announced on Friday.
So what's the situation here? This video can not be played Who makes which decisions when it comes to coronavirus? With many policy responsibilities devolved to Wales - across areas including health, social care and education - there are decisions which are in the in-trays of Welsh Government ministers. But other issues, like the furlough scheme, and quarantine for travellers arriving in the UK - are decisions for the UK Government. So here's a reminder ofwho does what. Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent Most schools in Wales have been shut since the end of March The UK labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, says the prime ministerâs statement lacked âclarity and consensusâ. He told the BBC: âThis statement raises as many questions as it answers. We see the prospect of England, Scotland and Wales pulling in different directions, so there's a big gap here for the government to make up.â He says that if he were PM, he would have âtried to build a consensusâ and would have made sure - if possible - that the devolved administrations, trade unions, and community groups were âon boardâ and knew âexactly what was required of them.â Sir Keir leader adds: âI accept a plan had to be set out, but to lack that basic clarity and consensus is a real problem.â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Boris Johnson has made a
""reckless move"". Speaking on a specialBBC Wales Todayprogramme, Mr Price
said the prime minister's strategy signalled ""the end of the four nation approach"" to the UK. ""We now have a
three nation approach from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with a simple
clear stay at home message. England has signalled a move away from that,"" he added. ""The Stay Alert message is confusing. It's the wrong
decision for England but is also sending a mixed message and makes our work here [in Wales] harder.""  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is concerned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was not clear enough in his address that he was talking mainly about changes in England. ""I think it is incumbent on him, perhaps a bit more strongly than he did tonight, to stress that when he is talking about lifting these restrictions, he is talking for England,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""When he talks about things like border control, he is talking for the whole UK, but really all of us have a duty right now to be as clear as possible and, having watched the prime minister, I think there is still some room for some simpler messages."" In the past half hour, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spoken about changes to lockdown in England. So what did he announce?  The lockdown situation in Wales is different.'Modest' changes to the rules herewere announced First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has relaxed the exercise rules in England saying can people âdrive to other destinations"" for a walk. But the Welsh Government's Counsel General Jeremy Miles has said this is not the case in Wales. ""Our regulations do not permit people to get in their car and drive to destinations in Wales,""  said Mr Miles. ""And that also means people getting in their cars in England."" Mr Miles says the police in Wales ""absolutely have the power to fine"" people for making non-essential journeys and not exercising near their homes. Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams has made it clear that the situation regarding education in Wales has not changed sinceher statement last Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

The rules in Wales don't permit you to drive long distances for leisure, the Welsh Government's Counsel General Jeremy Miles has confirmed, with police having the power to issue fines. Here's a reminder of thelockdown rules in Wales.  Boris Johnson says the next step from Wednesday will be to âencourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exerciseâ in England. He says: âYou can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.â But he warns people âmust obey the rules on social distancingâ and to enforce them, the fines police can give out will be increased. Johnson says, âwith ever increasing dataâ and being able to track progress, âif we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.â Boris Johnson says there will be five alert levels in the new system for England, with level one meaning the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five being âthe most critical â the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmedâ. The PM says there as been a period at level four during the lockdown, but âthanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level threeâ. However, he says âeveryone will have a role to play in keeping the R downâ¦ by staying alert and following the rules.â And he adds there are two more things to do âto keep pushing the number of infections downâ. âWe must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. âAnd if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.â Boris Johnsontells people to ""stay alert""as he outlines steps to modify measures in England. It comes after he unveiled an alert system to rank the threat level of coronavirus in England. The UK government is replacing the ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan with ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"". The ""stay at home"" advice will remain in place inScotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandleaders in the three devolved nations said Mr Johnson had not consulted them on the new message. The coronavirus lockdown advice has not changed in Wales despite  Boris Johnson's address,the First Minister has said. The prime minister laid out England's coronavirus response for the next three weeks. However in Wales,new rules allowing people to exercise more oftenand for garden centres to open,
if they can comply with social distancing, will come into effect tomorrow. Mr Drakeford said people should remain at home ""wherever you can""  because coronavirus ""has not gone away"". ""If you need to leave home for work, exercise or shopping, you
should stay local and stay alert,"" he added. ""The way we behave over the weeks ahead will continue to have a
profound impact on our NHS and our ability to save lives."" Mr Drakeford said any plans for the future depend upon how the virus behaves over the coming weeks and months. However he reaffirmed that schools will not return to normal
on 1 June. He added: ""We will continue to make decisions, which are right for Wales,
using information and expert advice about how coronavirus is circulating here
to keep us safe."" Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts has tweeted her response to Boris Johnson's statement so far: Allow Twitter content?

The PM reiterates the governmentâs five tests for ending lockdown in England: protecting the NHS, seeing a sustained fall in death rates, a fall in the rate of infection, sorting out âchallengesâ - such as procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) - and stopping the so-called R number rising up over one and causing âexponential growthâ of the virus. He says we âcannot move forward unless we satisfy the five testsâ. Johnson announces the previewed plans by launching a new âCovid Alert Systemâ which, he says, will be run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. He says the level the country is at will be determined primarily by the R number and the number of coronavirus cases, and âwill tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measuresâ, namely âthe lower the level, the fewer the measures, the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to beâ.

"The UK government said any discrimination is 'completely unacceptable' Many pregnant women have been wrongly sent home on sick pay or unpaid leave during the coronavirus crisis, a Welsh MP has claimed. The Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi says she is handling cases from constituents about employers believed to be in breach of health and safety law. She says cases include employees of the NHS or care homes. But NHS Wales health boards say staff are paid in full if they are advised they should not be in work. Campaigners have called on the government to issue more guidance for employers of pregnant women. Key supermarket workers denied bonus 'I'm being penalised because I took maternity leave' Uncertainty over maternity care causing distress The UK Government say they are monitoring the situation closely, but any maternity discrimination is ""completely unacceptable""' Gemma has been put on unpaid leave Gemma, not her real name, is 16 weeks pregnant and is a care assistant at a care home in Wrexham. ""I've been told by my midwife that staying off work is wise,"" she said. ""My boss has been supportive about me being off work but it has been put as unpaid leave. ""I have asked about being furloughed and the head office has told me they aren't furloughing anyone at all."" Gemma was advised by her employer that she could get sick pay if she phoned her doctor. ""I could phone up for sick pay but I don't think that's right because sick pay is for sick people,"" she said. ""If you're not sick you shouldn't be getting sick pay. We had to take a mortgage holiday. ""I'm already on minimum wage, so when I get to maternity leave I'm going to be paying more of my mortgage. ""I'm a first-time mum as well and it's just really scary."" Health and safety law in the UK states that if there are any risks to an expectant mother at work, her employers must adjust her working conditions, offer her alternative work, or if that is not possible suspend her from work on paid leave for as long as necessary. The UK Government has said some pregnant workers will be at greater risk of severe illness from Covid-19 and will have received a shielding letter from the NHS. Employers need to take this into account in their risk assessment and, if the necessary control measures such as working from home cannot be put in place, they should suspend the pregnant worker on full pay. Louise, whose name has been changed, is a healthcare assistant from Wrexham who received a shielding letter advising her to self-isolate for 12 weeks - so she is unable to go into work. But her employer has asked her to take maternity leave early. Joeli Brearley wants to see more guidanced issued for employers ""I'm currently on maternity leave which is due to end on 11 May, but I am pregnant again with my next maternity due to start on 1 August 2020. ""Due to me not being sick I am unable to claim sick pay. I have been advised I will have to take my maternity leave from 21 June. I have also lost out on my next lot of maternity pay due to not earning enough wages from 11-30 May. ""So now I am currently not working with zero pay, and will be until March 2021."" Louise claims her employer would not furlough her because she is on a zero hours contract, but the UK government says you can be furloughed on ""any type of contract."" Joeli Brearley is the founder of the organisation Pregnant Then Screwed, who provide advice for women experiencing pregnancy discrimination. She says since pregnant women were included in the list of clinically vulnerable people as a precaution on 16 March, her organisation has received many reports of unlawful treatment. ""We're hearing from pregnant women who are suspended on no pay. We're hearing from pregnant women who were told to stop, told to take annual leave. Pregnant women who were told to take their maternity leave early. ""And then we're hearing from a large number of women who are being suspended on sick pay when they're not sick. So, again, that's unlawful. And it means that they're really, really struggling financially, because these are very small amounts of money."" ""We're also, in addition to that, hearing from many women who are still being forced to work in environments that they consider unsafe."" Ms Brearley believes the government needs to issue more guidance for employers of pregnant women. ""I think the reason why it's happening is because this is all very new,"" she said. ""And the government hasn't issued specific advice for employers. ""So they really have no idea how they're meant to be behaving. And that's why we're seeing such diversity in reactions to pregnant women, because there's no clear guidance on it. A UK Government spokesperson said: ""Pregnancy and maternity discrimination is completely unacceptable and the law remains the same. ""The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed, including pregnant women."" Ms Antoniazzi, a Labour MP for the Gower, said most of the queries she has received from constituents are from pregnant women working for the NHS and care homes. ""Women need to know their rights,"" she said. ""And it is really important that even though you might not be feeling like you want to have a conversation with your employer that those conversations are had. An employer needs to know what their situation is and they need to be seeking advice in order for them to look after their employees that are pregnant."" NHS Wales health boards who responded to requests for comment confirmed no pregnant women are expected to take leave on sick pay or no pay to protect themselves - and that pregnant employees should be offered alternative work if any workplace risks cannot be removed. Ms Brearley recommends women who believe they have been treated unlawfully write to their employer, seek legal advice or call their helpline. She added: ""People are in crisis mode at the moment. And what we see throughout history is when the economy contracts, when there are crises afoot, women tend to suffer and pregnancy, maternity discrimination increases."" ""We are seen as less committed and we're seen as a burden to business: 'we're going to cost money. We're going to go off and take leave.' ""Most of that is not true. It's a complete misnomer. We don't cost anything. The government pays statutory maternity pay. We're certainly not not committed. We're very committed to our work, even if we do have children. But we do know that those biases tend to be more pronounced in times of crisis."" Pregnant women can be furloughed, subject to agreement and depending on the employment contract, but should not be furloughed just because they are pregnant If you're getting Maternity Allowance while you're on maternity leave, you cannot get furlough pay at the same time. If you have agreed to be put on furlough, you must contact Jobcentre Plus to stop your Maternity Allowance payments. The UK Government has passed a law to ensure that, for furloughed workers whose paternity or maternity leave begins on or after the 25 April, the ""earnings test"" will take into account the person's usual wages not their furloughed wages. The UK Government states you can be furloughed on any type of contract, including a zero hours contract. If you were made redundant or stopped working for your employer after 28 February 2020, your employer can agree to re-employ you and place you on furlough. When an employee provides written notification to her employer stating that she is pregnant, the employer should immediately take into account any risks identified in their workplace risk assessment. If the risk cannot be removed employers are required to: Temporarily adjust her working conditions and/or hours of work; or if that is not possible Offer her suitable alternative work (at the same rate of pay) if available, or if that is not feasible Suspend her from work on paid leave for as long as necessary, to protect her health and safety and that of her child.

"The government has admitted sending about 50,000 coronavirus tests to the US last week for processing after ""operational issues"" in UK labs. The Department of Health said sending swabs abroad is among the contingencies to deal with ""teething problems"". The samples were airlifted to the US in chartered flights from Stansted Airport,the Sunday Telegraph said,external. Results will be validated in the UK and sent to patients as soon as possible. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said expanding Britain's virus testing network had involved setting up an ""entirely new"" lab network to process tests, adding ""contingencies"" - such as sending swabs abroad - were in place for when ""problems arise"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the kits had to be sent abroad because of a ""temporary failure"" at a lab. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the move ""shows our determination to get the job done"". Why did the UK need 100,000 tests a day? Coronavirus testing for key workers 'shambolic' UK government testing goal 'source of frustration' Meanwhile, the government has sent anurgent alert to hospitals,externalrecalling 15.8m protective goggles due to safety concerns. Although the ""Tiger Eye"" protectors, purchased in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic, were in CE marked boxes - meaning they should have met European Union safety requirements - the goggles have since been retested and do not provide proper splash protection. Commenting on the recall, which was firstreported in the Sunday Telegraph,external, a DHSC spokeswoman said the safety of front-line staff was ""our top priority"". She added that hospital trusts should have enough goggles to ""immediately stop"" using the ""Tiger Eye"" protectors. A further 9.2m of the goggles are in quarantine, she added. The revelations come as the government failed to hit the 100,000 daily tests target set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the seventh day in a row. There were 96,878 tests delivered in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday, down from 97,029 the day before.

But health leaders said they expected ""fluctuations"" in the figures, and that testing was still much higher than it was at the start of the outbreak. Speaking at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Saturday, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said he expected ""fluctuation"" in the day-to-day figures. He said: ""We are now really at a high plateau, in the region of 100,000 tests per day. ""I don't think we can read too much into day-to-day variations, but the macro picture is this is now at a much, much higher level than it ever was at the beginning of this crisis."" BBC health reporter Rachel Schraer said theUK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. But it also took several weeks to expand from an initial eight public health laboratories to a wider network of private and university labs. Unlike the UK, countries like Germany and South Korea rapidly stockpiled kits and made the test available to a larger number of labs. Prof Van-Tam also told the briefing that the test-and-trace strategy of finding people with the virus and tracking people they have been in contact with was ""part of the solution"" needed to ease the lockdown.

"Decisions on which shops reopen after lockdown should be based on safety, not their size or business type, the British Retail Consortium has said. Chief executive Helen Dickinson told the BBC she expects a ""gradual lifting"" of the restrictions with schools and transport reopening early on. Ms Dickinson said it would be harder for retail staff to return to work while schools remain closed. Boris Johnson will address the nation about the restrictions later on Sunday. The prime minister is not expected to provide dates for when the coronavirus restrictions - first announced on 23 March - might change. Prime minister to launch Covid-19 alert system No 'single leap to freedom', minister warns Garden centres in England to reopen next week But a senior government source has told the BBC that garden centres in England will be allowed to reopen from Wednesday provided they comply with social distancing. Mr Johnson is expected to confirm this on Sunday, when he is also set tounveil a new Covid-19 alert system in England to track the virus. Meanwhile, Ms Dickinson believes the government's guidance will reflect her organisation's own advice on the practical measures that can be taken to promote staff and customer safety. These measures would include staggering shift times, managing the number of people in store, and the use of plastic screens at payment points. She said it is ""incumbent"" on retailers to ensure they can operate safely otherwise ""they shouldn't open"", adding that supermarkets have ""shown us the way"" over the past couple of months. Safety measures, she added, would ""give us confidence as shoppers, members of the public, that we can go out to shop"". She said a phased lifting of restrictions across different industries, with schools and transport addressed early on would help those retail staff with children.

In aletter to the Observer,external, the head of the shop workers' union, Usdaw, and three other major union leaders, said they will not recommend their members return to work unless the government guarantees ""the right policies and practices are in place to make workplaces safe"". ""The trade union movement wants to be able to recommend the government's back-to-work plans,"" the letter said. ""But for us to do that we need to ensure that ministers have listened and that we stay safe and save lives at work too."" Workers could also face issues getting to work. On Saturday, Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid even with public transport reverting to a full service, social distancing measures would leave effective capacity for only one in 10 passengers in many parts of the network. He urged people returning to work to walk or cycle, and announced pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors will be created in England within weeks as part of a Â£250m emergency fund. Ms Dickinson also urged the government to ensure we avoid ""a cliff edge of support falling way as soon as restrictions lifted"". She called for ""some form of tapering down"" of the government's job retention scheme,which is set to run until the end of June.

"For Sudeep Choudhury, work on merchant ships promised adventure and a better life. But a voyage on an oil tanker in West Africa, in dangerous seas far from home, would turn the young graduate's life upside down. His fate would come to depend on a band of drug-fuelled jungle pirates - and the whims of a mysterious figure called The King. The MT Apecus dropped anchor off Nigeria's Bonny Island shortly after sunrise. Sudeep Choudhury was at the end of a draining shift on deck. Looking towards land, he could make out dozens of other ships. On the shoreline beyond them, a column of white oil storage tanks rose out of the ground like giants. He had breakfast and then made two phone calls. One to his parents - he knew they worried about him, their only child - and one to his fiancee, Bhagyashree. He told her that everything was going to plan and that he would call her again later that day. He then clambered into bed for a sleep. It was 19 April, 2019. The small, ageing oil tanker and its crew of 15 had spent two days sailing south from the port of Lagos to the Niger Delta, where oil was discovered in the 1950s by Dutch and British businessmen seeking a swift fortune. Although he knew that vicious pirates roamed the labyrinthine wetlands and mangroves of the delta, Sudeep felt safe that tropical South Atlantic morning. Nigerian navy boats were patrolling and the Apecus was moored just outside Bonny, seven nautical miles from land, waiting for permission to enter port. The warm waters of the Gulf of Guinea, which lap across the coastline of seven West African nations, are the most dangerous in the world. It used to be Somalia, but now this area is the epicentre of modern sea piracy. Of all the seafarers held for ransom globally last year, some 90% were taken here. Sixty-four people were seized from six ships in just the last three months of 2019, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks such incidents. Many more attacks may have gone unreported. The bountiful oil found here could have made the people of the delta rich, but for most it has been a curse. Spills have poisoned the water and the land, and a fight over the spoils of the industry has fuelled violent crime and conflict for decades. In the villages above the pipelines that have netted billions for the Nigerian government and international oil companies, life expectancy is about 45 years. Militant groups with comic book names like the Niger Delta Avengers have blown up pipelines and crippled production to demand the redistribution of wealth and resources. Oil thieves siphon off thick black crude and process it in makeshift refineries hidden in the forest. The level of violence in the delta ebbs and flows - but the threat is always there. Sudeep woke up a few hours later to yelling and banging. The watchman in the ship's command room, high above the deck, had spotted an approaching speedboat carrying nine heavily-armed men. His cry of warning ricocheted around the 80m-long ship as the crew scrambled. They couldn't stop the pirates, but they could at least try to hide. Sudeep, just 28 but the ship's third officer, was in charge of the five other Indian crew working on the Apecus. There was no oil on board, so he knew the pirates would want to take human cargo for ransom. Americans and Europeans are highly prized because their companies pay the highest ransoms but in reality, most sailors come from the developing world. On the Apecus, the Indians were the only non-Africans. With less than five minutes to act, Sudeep gathered his men in the engine room in the bowels of the ship before running upstairs to set off an emergency alarm that would notify everyone on board. On his way back down, he realised he was only wearing the underwear he had gone to sleep in. Then he caught his first glimpse of  the attackers, who were wearing T-shirts and black face coverings, and brandishing assault rifles. They were alongside the vessel, confidently hooking a ladder onto the side. The Indians decided to hide in a small storeroom, where they crouched among lights, wires and other electrical supplies, and tried to still their panicked breathing. The pirates were soon prowling around outside, their voices echoing above the low hum of engine machinery. The sailors were trembling but stayed silent. Many ships that sail in the Gulf of Guinea invest in safe rooms with bullet-proof walls where crews can take shelter in exactly this kind of situation. The Apecus didn't have one. The men heard footsteps approaching and the bolt slid open with a clang. Get up. The pirates fired at the floor and a bullet fragment struck Sudeep in his left shin, lodging itself just an inch from the bone. The men marched the sailors outside and up onto the deck. They knew they had to move very quickly. The captain had put out a distress call and the gunshots might have been heard by other ships. The attackers ordered the Indians to climb down a ladder onto the waiting speedboat, which had two engines for extra speed. Chirag, a nervous 22-year-old on his first deployment at sea, was the first to comply. With the pirates' guns trained on them the others followed, as did the captain. The six hostages - five Indians and one Nigerian - squatted uncomfortably on the overcrowded boat as it began to motor away. The remaining crew, including one Indian who had managed to evade the attackers, emerged onto the deck. They watched as the pirates sped off towards the delta with their blindfolded captives, leaving the Apecus floating in the tide. The text message from the shipping agent arrived in the middle of the night. Dear Sir, understandably Sudeep's vessel has been hijacked. The Greek owner is co-ordinating the matter. Don't get panicky. No harm will come to Sudeep. Please keep patience. Pradeep Choudhury and his wife Suniti, sitting in their bedroom, were left reeling by this perfunctory message. They had spoken to their son just hours earlier. Pradeep began forwarding the text to family members and Sudeep's closest friends. Could this really be true? Had anyone heard from their son? Sudeep, as anyone who knows him will say, was mischievous growing up. He was restless, always wanting to get out of the house for an adventure. And his parents, especially his mother, would constantly worry about him. They have lived in Bhubaneswar, a small city in the state of Odisha on India's eastern coast, for most of Sudeep's life. It's a place that Indians living in the centres of power and influence - Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore - rarely, if ever, think about, but running a small photocopying shop from the front of their home gave the Choudhurys a comfortable life. On the busy pavements near their home in central Bhubaneswar, the faces of deities stare out from modest shrines. But before he left for Africa, Sudeep didn't really believe in any kind of god. Life would be what he and Bhagyashree could make of it. They met when they were teenagers. Now a software engineer, she has the air of a girl who would have been popular at school. The couple are the kind of aspirational young Indians whose dreams far eclipse the stable, traditional family lives that their parents craved. There are tens of millions like them in India, armed with degrees and certificates but coming of age in a lumbering economy that continues to churn out many more graduates than well-paying jobs. For Sudeep, a job in merchant shipping promised an escape from all of that. He was lured by stories of good money, plenty of work and a chance to see the world. And he's not alone - after Filipinos and Indonesians, Indians make up the largest contingent of global seafarers, working as deckhands, cooks, engineers and officers. Some 234,000 of them sailed on foreign-flagged vessels in 2019. But getting the right qualifications is complicated and Sudeep studied for five years, set on a path that cost his family thousands of dollars. At the age of 27, he finally qualified as a third officer and got a tattoo on his right forearm to celebrate: a little sailing boat bobbing on a cluster of triangles representing the sea, with a large anchor cutting straight through the middle like a dagger. On the first morning after the sailors were kidnapped, dozens of men emerged from the forest and fired their guns into the sky for nearly half an hour to celebrate. The five Indians, who had been left on a car-sized wooden platform floating on a mangrove swamp, stared hopelessly at the brown water below them. To get to their jungle prison they had been taken on a snaking, hours-long boat ride through the waterways of the delta. In those first days, the message from the pirates - reinforced with occasional beatings - was clear: if no-one pays a ransom, we will kill you. Sudeep was still living in his underwear and itched all night under buzzing mosquitoes that left his skin dotted with bites. He hadn't been given a bandage for the wound on his leg, so he had pushed mud into the hole. The humidity of the jungle meant the men were never dry. They shared a single dirty mat for a bed, and would snatch brief minutes of sleep before jolting awake and remembering where they were. Early on, the pirates had dragged a skeleton up from the swamp to show the sailors what had supposedly become of a former hostage whose boss had refused to pay. That wasn't the only macabre threat. On another day, they were shown a pile of concrete blocks. Try anything and we'll strap these to your legs and drop you in the ocean, the pirates told them. A rotating cast of guards kept watch from the riverbank, 10 or so metres away. They spent their time fishing, smoking marijuana and drinking a local spirit made from palm sap called kai-kai - but they also watched the hostages closely, occasionally training a gun on them and yelling out a warning, as if their captives might suddenly dive into the murky water and swim away. Over time, Sudeep would try to strike up a relationship with some of these men. He would gently ask them how they were, or if they had children. But the response was always silence, or a blunt warning.Don't talk to us.They appeared to be under strict orders but never referred to their leader - who seemed to be based elsewhere in the jungle - by name. He was just ""The King"". Sudeep and the other men - Chirag, 22, Ankit, 21, Avinash, 22, and Moogu, 34 - had little choice but to try to conserve their energy and wait for something to happen. Their lives fell into a kind of lethargic routine. Once a day, normally in mid-morning, they would get a bowl of instant noodles to share between the five of them. They would carefully ration the meal, passing around a grimy spoon and each taking one mouthful. They would repeat the ritual in the evening and hand back the empty bowl. They were given nothing to drink except muddy water, which was often mixed with petrol. Sometimes they were so thirsty they drank saltwater from the river. The Nigerian captain was kept separately in a hut nearby. He was treated better and the Indians began to loathe him for it. To pass time, the five men would talk about their lives back home and their plans for the future. They would watch the nature around them - snakes slithering up trees, birds taking flight through the mangroves. They would pray. If the pirates spotted a monkey, the quiet would be broken. The Indians would watch them scramble after it, spraying the animal with bullets. It would later be cooked over a bonfire but the meat was never shared with them. The sailors tried to keep track of each passing sunset by etching small arrows into the wooden planks that they slept on. They were at times delirious - some of them, including Sudeep, contracted malaria. In whispers, they would imagine a scenario where the pirates came to kill them and they fought back. If they were going to die, they could probably kill at least three of them on the way down, right? At moments like this they laughed, but it was a constant battle not to sink into despair. During the many quiet hours in which they would simply lie under the beating sun, Sudeep would think over and over what he could do to get them out, and what he would tell the Indian High Commission or his family if he got a chance to call. In his head, he was still trying to plan his wedding. The pirates' initial demand was for a ransom of several million dollars. It was an exorbitant sum and one they must have known was unlikely to be paid. But these kinds of ransom kidnappings involve complex and drawn-out negotiations, and in the undiscoverable warrens of the Niger Delta, time always seemed to be on their side. About 15 days after the attack, the pirates took Sudeep on a boat to another part of the forest, and handed him a satellite phone so he could appeal directly to the ship owner, a Greek businessman based in the Mediterranean port of Piraeus called Captain Christos Traios. His company, Petrogress Inc, operates several oil tankers in West Africa with swashbuckling names like the Optimus and the Invictus. Sudeep knew little about Capt Christos but had heard he was an aggressive, bad-tempered man. ""Sir, this is terrible. We are in a very bad condition. And I need you to act very fast because we might die here,"" he told him. His boss, furious about what had happened, was apparently unmoved. The pirates were incensed. ""We just want money,"" they would say over and over again. ""But if your people don't give us money, we will kill you."" Their business model is dependent on the compliance of ship bosses who, usually covered by insurance, will pay significant amounts to free their crew after weeks of negotiations. But in this case they were up against a stubborn ship owner. The key now, the kidnappers knew, would be to reach the families. Back in India, Sudeep's parents spent their nights lying awake. They knew so little about what had happened that their minds veered towards the worst in those hours before dawn broke, when the streets of Bhubaneswar would briefly be still. They feared their son would never emerge from a pirates' den that they could scarcely imagine. There was no way the family could afford to pay the pirates directly and it was never considered as a serious option. The Indian government doesn't pay ransoms but they hoped it would help them in other ways - by assisting the Nigerian navy to find the pirate camp, or forcing the ship owner to pay up. Bhagyashree and Swapna, a formidable cousin of Sudeep in her mid-30s, took charge of this effort. They corralled the family members of the kidnapped men into a WhatsApp group so they could co-ordinate efforts to get their boys freed. It soon became clear to Bhagyashree that the pirates would gain nothing by killing the sailors. But she was nervous about how long their patience would last. Pressuring the ship owner from all directions seemed the only feasible way to get her fiancee out.  And so in the car, in the bathroom stall at work, and at home lying in bed, she was online, tweeting, firing off pleading emails to anyone who might be able to help. After three weeks of near-silence, on day 17, the families had a breakthrough. A sister of one of the kidnapped men, Avinash, received a call from her brother in the Nigerian jungle. He told her that all the men were alive but they really needed help. The other families would go on to receive calls from their sons in the coming days - but not Bhagyashree and the Choudhurys. Strange relationships began to be forged. A relative of one of the sailors who works in the shipping industry, a man called Captain Nasib, began calling the pirates regularly on their satellite phone to check on the men's condition. But the tinny audio recordings he posted in the WhatsApp chat did not reassure the families. The ship owner ""does not care"" about the lives of his men and is ""playing around"", a pirate angrily told Capt Nasib in one phone call. On 17 May 2019 - day 28 - the pirates gave Sudeep the chance to speak to Capt Nasib, who assured him that the ordeal would only last a few more days. But Sudeep, as the ranking officer, was told he had to keep everyone's morale high in the meantime. ""I'm trying,"" Sudeep can be heard responding in Hindi in a crackly recording of the call. ""Tell my family that you talked to me."" Every few weeks the Indians were moved from one jungle lair to another. As negotiations with Capt Christos seemingly broke down, The King himself began to visit them. He would never say much, but the other pirates treated him with a reverence that suggested fear. His status as the group's leader almost seemed a consequence of his sheer size. All the pirates were muscle-bound and threatening but The King was especially hulking - at least 6ft 6in. He carried a much larger gun than the men under his command, and a leather belt filled with bullets was always strapped around his massive frame. He would turn up every four or five days and calmly smoke some marijuana before the captives. He would say that Capt Christos was still not playing ball and that this would have consequences. The King spoke deliberately, and with better English than the other men. After many weeks in captivity, the sailors were becoming bony and thin; their eyes were a pale yellow and their urine was at times blood-red. Each visit from the King felt like it brought them closer to the fate of the skeleton they had seen pulled from the mud. Then events took a more bizarre turn. Up until this point, what had happened to the Apecus seemed to be just another opportunistic ransom kidnapping. But in late May, unbeknown to the men who sat festering on those planks in the swamp, machinations were unfolding that seemed to point to a far more complex series of events. The Nigerian navy had publicly accused the tanker company of being involved in the transport of stolen crude oil from the Niger Delta to Ghana. The attack on the Apecus and the kidnapping, according to the navy, had actually been provoked by a disagreement between two criminal groups. There had even been arrests. The ship company's manager in Nigeria had apparently confessed to being involved in illicit oil trading. Capt Christos, the ship's owner, fervently denied this. In emails seen by the BBC, he blamed the Indian government for getting the Nigerian navy to detain his vessels and staff in order to force him to ""negotiate with terrorists"" and pay an ""incredible"" ransom. Indian authorities dispute this version of events. The Nigerian Navy didn't comment. It was a precarious situation for the captives. But the accusations - which put Capt Christos's tanker operations in Nigeria at risk - did seem to spur him to reach a resolution with the pirates. And so on 13 June, Sudeep's family finally learned from a government source that negotiations were complete and that payment was being arranged. At the same time, the sailors in the jungle were told that their ordeal might be coming to an end. The men woke up on the morning of 29 June 2019 like they had almost every day for the previous 70 days. At mid-morning, after handing over the bowl of noodles, one of the guards beckoned Sudeep over and whispered that if things worked out, this could be his last day in the jungle. Two hours later the guard returned with confirmation: the man bringing the money was on his way. The frail Ghanaian man in his mid-60s who approached in a boat that afternoon, nervously clutching a heavy plastic bag with US dollars peeking out of the top, did not look like a seasoned negotiator. Within minutes of his arrival, it was clear something was not right. A group of pirates began beating the old man. The King, bellowing about the money being short, pulled a small knife out of his belt and stabbed him in the leg, leaving him writhing on the muddy ground. He then approached the Indians and told them that while the Ghanaian would be staying, all six captives were free to go. His men wouldn't stop them, but if another pirate group picked them up, they were on their own. He looked Sudeep in the eye: ""Bye-bye."" The men did not hesitate. They ran to the water's edge, where the fishing boat that had brought the bag man was parked. Sudeep told the driver to take them where he had come from. After more than two months he was still in his underwear, though the pirates had given him a torn T-shirt to wear. The boat rocked unsteadily from side to side as it motored away. After nearly four hours, the driver said he was out of fuel and stopped at a jetty. In the distance, on the outskirts of a small village, a group of barefoot men were playing football. The ragged sailors approached them. When they explained they had been kidnapped, they were ushered into a house and given bottles of water which they gulped down one after the other. Three of the village's biggest men kept guard outside the guesthouse they were housed in during the night. The Indians, though weak, finally felt safe. ""It was as if God himself appointed them as our saviours,"" Sudeep said later. The men were soon in bustling Lagos, waiting for a flight to Mumbai. Alone for the first time in his hotel room, Sudeep poured himself a cold beer, ran a bath and examined his scars. A pirate had inflicted a fresh wound with a fish cleaver on his shoulder a few days before, which stung as he gingerly lowered himself into the steaming bath. An Indian diplomat had given him a packet of cigarettes and over the next hour, he smoked 12 of them one after the other, staring at the ceiling as the water around him slowly cooled. It's been eight months since the men were released. Suniti, wearing a yellow sari, sits on the kitchen floor, rolling chapatis on a round block of wood. A few metres away her husband watches the Indian cricket team play New Zealand on TV. ""Sudeeeeeeep!"" Suniti calls her son to come downstairs and eat but it sounds like a cry of yearning, as though she's checking he's still here. He lost more than 20kg in the 70 days that he spent in the jungle and returned with sunken cheeks. His mother weighed him every few days for the first month, feeling buoyed with each kilo gained. Bhagyashree passes her mother-in-law a metal plate, her red and gold wedding bangles sliding down her arm as she does so. ""I was confident he would return,"" she says. ""It's just the start for us, so how can I spend life without him? I believed in the Almighty - that he would come, that he had to come. Nothing can end like this."" They finally got married in January. The couple have their own space upstairs, but every evening the four of them eat as a family in the small living room on the ground floor. On this night cousin Swapna - who campaigned ferociously for Sudeep's release - is visiting, and sings a 1960s Bollywood love song after dinner. Back in his tight-knit family and community, Sudeep appears to have found stability. He is working at the local maritime college, teaching young sailors about safety at sea, although he has put his own ocean-faring days behind him. He shows flashes of joy with his family and friends, but it's hard to tell what mark months in a pirates' den has left behind. They rarely talk about it. ""The trauma is still there,"" he tells me, as we drive around the dark streets of Bhubaneswar with pop music playing on the car speaker. ""But it's okay. I got married and all my friends and family are here... If I go to the sea then that thing will come again in my mind."" The ordeal is over but Sudeep and the other men remain tangled in a bureaucratic mess to try to get someone to take responsibility for what happened to them. Since returning, they have not received their salaries, nor any compensation. Sudeep reckons he's owed close to $10,000 in wages for the more than seven months he spent on the ship and in captivity. Capt Christos did not respond to detailed questions about the kidnapping, whether he disputed that he owed Sudeep money and about the fate of the Ghanaian man left behind with the pirates. He said in an email: ""All the kidnapped personnel was safely released and return [sic] to their homes, thanks to Owners ONLY!"" The company continues to deny that the Apecus was involved in the purchase of illegal oil, and instead argues it was at Bonny Island for repairs and to pick up supplies. A court case is pending in Nigeria. What happened to Sudeep underscores the vulnerability of those who find themselves in trouble or exploited at sea - a frontier where regulations and labour protections in theory exist but are difficult to enforce. Seafarers are on the front line of global trade - Nigerian oil ends up at petrol stations across Western Europe, including the UK, as well as India and other parts of Asia. Stories like Sudeep's, of which there are many, also reflect the human cost of security failings in the Gulf of Guinea. Unlike Somalia, Nigeria - the largest economy in Africa - will not allow international navies to patrol its waters. After all he's been through, it seems cruel that Sudeep should need to go through another fight. But he says that he wants to pursue it until the end. ""I faced this and that means I can face anything in my life,"" he says on another late-night drive. ""No-one can break me down mentally. Because for me it's a second birth, I'm living another life."" I ask him if it really feels that way. ""It's not feeling that - itismy second life,"" he replies. We park outside his house - it's past 11pm but the lights are still on inside. Bhagyashree and his parents are waiting.

Leaders of the devolved nations - which have the power to set their own lockdown regulations - said they had not been consulted over the ""stay alert"" message. Ms Sturgeon said the first she heard of the updated guidance was in newspaper reports. Giving Scotland's daily coronavirus briefing, she said that, other than allowing people to leave home for exercise more than once a day, the rules there had not changed. ""We remain in lockdown for now and my ask of you is to remain at home"", she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is part of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned some people might take the more generalised ""alert"" slogan as a ""green light"" to socialise. ""I do not think this is a helpful message in terms of guiding behaviour. It does not give advice as to what people should do,"" she told the PA news agency. Meanwhile, the government's pandemic response has been called ""wishy-washy"" by a body representing police officers in London. It comes after a police force in east London shared an image of a crowded park in Hackney on Saturday, where hundreds of people, they said, were eating and drinking alcohol. Police officers patrol Greenwich Park, in London, on Saturday. Ken Marsh, from the Metropolitan Police Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme authorities ""needed to be firmer right from the beginning"" and that if authorities had been more stringent from the outset ""we would have a better result now"". But another adviser to Sage, Prof Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend outdoor activities posed a ""relatively low risk"" so long as people with symptoms were not going out and that those who needed to quarantine themselves did so. In his address, the prime minister announced the launch of an alert system for tracking coronavirus in England and unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society, allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mr Johnson also said people who could not work from home should return to the workplace - but avoid public transport.

Giving Scotland's daily coronavirus briefing, she said that, other than allowing people to leave home for exercise more than once a day, the rules there had not changed. ""We remain in lockdown for now and my ask of you is to remain at home"", she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is part of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned some people might take the more generalised ""alert"" slogan as a ""green light"" to socialise. ""I do not think this is a helpful message in terms of guiding behaviour. It does not give advice as to what people should do,"" she told the PA news agency. Meanwhile, the government's pandemic response has been called ""wishy-washy"" by a body representing police officers in London. It comes after a police force in east London shared an image of a crowded park in Hackney on Saturday, where hundreds of people, they said, were eating and drinking alcohol. Police officers patrol Greenwich Park, in London, on Saturday. Ken Marsh, from the Metropolitan Police Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme authorities ""needed to be firmer right from the beginning"" and that if authorities had been more stringent from the outset ""we would have a better result now"". But another adviser to Sage, Prof Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend outdoor activities posed a ""relatively low risk"" so long as people with symptoms were not going out and that those who needed to quarantine themselves did so. In his address, the prime minister announced the launch of an alert system for tracking coronavirus in England and unveiled a ""conditional plan"" to reopen society, allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday. Mr Johnson also said people who could not work from home should return to the workplace - but avoid public transport. The lockdown has already been extended for another three weeks in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to 28 May.

"Newcastle United sat 13th in the Premier League when the season was suspended in March Newcastle United and the Premier League must put moral values ahead of financial gains, says the fiancee of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund looks set to finance 80% of a Â£300m takeover of the club. Khashoggi was killed in 2018 with Western intelligence agencies believing that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder - which he denies. ""Moral values should prevail,"" Hatice Cengiz told BBC 5 Live. ""My message would be to the management of Newcastle United and to the decision makers. ""We should consider ethical values, not just financial or political ones. Money cannot buy everything in the world. So the message that will be given to people like Crown Prince is extremely important. ""There should be no place in English football for those credibly accused of atrocities and murder"". The Premier League declined to comment. Fans vow to raise Saudi issues despite support for deal Khashoggi - a dissident Saudi columnist living in self-exile in the United States - had gone to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, seeking papers to marry Cengiz. Investigators believe that as she waited outside, the 59-year-old was murdered and then dismembered. His remains have never been found. UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. A court in Saudi Arabia last year sentenced five people to death and jailed three others over his murder, while Turkey has separately charged 20 suspects over the murder. ""We don't want this deal to go ahead,"" Cengiz added. ""We are not just talking about the murder of a human being but the efforts to keep all hopes regarding the future, to keep human rights alive, to support justice and to start a transformation in the Middle East. ""This deal seems to be about buying something. But there is a wider picture. Saudi Arabia shows the world its face of reform. But it has another face where the reality is far from what is shown to the world. This is why we want this (deal) to be stopped and not be completed."" Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle since 2007 and put the club up for sale in 2017. The proposed Saudi takeover is thought to be worth some Â£300 million. But it has already caused much controversy. Who are the main people involved in the potential deal? Premier League warned over takeover The Saudi government has been accused of facilitating the theft of Premier League commercial rights, while Amnesty International has criticised the potential deal due to the country's dire human rights record. The country has also been accused of ""sportswashing"", a term used to describe countries that try to improve their international reputation by investing in major teams or hosting big sporting events. But these accusations have been rebuffed by the Saudi government, which claims it wants to get more of its people engaged in sport. Hatice Cengiz has called on the Premier League to block the takeover Cengiz has written to the Premier League to state the takeover should be blocked. In a reply to her letter from chief executive Richard Masters, seen by BBC Sport, he says the Premier League are following ""due processes required by UK law and by the Premier League's own rules"", which ""go beyond those required by UK company law"" and are ""applied with rigour"". But he says he ""appreciates the strength of feeling"" from her and reiterated his condolences. Last month, the Premier League was urged by one of its largest overseas broadcast partners to ""fully interrogate"" Newcastle United's proposed Â£300m takeover. The chief executive of the Qatar-based TV giant beIN Sport, Yousef al-Obaidly, has written to the chairs of top-flight clubs about the deal, which could see the Magpies bought by a Saudi-backed consortium. In the letter, Al-Obaidly accused the Saudi Arabian government of the ""facilitation of the nearthree-year theft of the Premier League's commercial rights- and in turn your club's commercial revenues - through its backing of the huge-scale beoutQ pirate service"". Dan Roan, BBC sports editor It should be decided soon, possibly this week, and yes it will go through. Certainly speak to those close to the consortium and they don't sound too concerned. They can point to the fact that Britain's been happy to do billions of pounds-worth of arms deals with the Saudis over recent years and I think it's significant that the British government the other day did make it clear that it wouldn't stand in the way of this deal, saying it was a matter for the Premier League. The PIF, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has declined to comment but it's understood its position is that although the Crown Prince is chair of the organisation, he is not involved with it in the day-to-day running so the accusations against him are not directly relevant to this bid. And the owners' and directors' tests the Premier League will be looking at now doesn't appear to have much to say about character. It refers to unspent convictions, but unless there is an obvious and clear link between a person and an offence or that person has been convicted in a court of law, it's difficult to see how they could fail the test.

"Decisions on which shops reopen after lockdown should be based on safety, not their size or business type, the British Retail Consortium has said. Chief executive Helen Dickinson told the BBC she expects a ""gradual lifting"" of the restrictions with schools and transport reopening early on. Ms Dickinson said it would be harder for retail staff to return to work while schools remain closed. Boris Johnson will address the nation about the restrictions later on Sunday. The prime minister is not expected to provide dates for when the coronavirus restrictions - first announced on 23 March - might change. Prime minister to launch Covid-19 alert system No 'single leap to freedom', minister warns Garden centres in England to reopen next week But a senior government source has told the BBC that garden centres in England will be allowed to reopen from Wednesday provided they comply with social distancing. Mr Johnson is expected to confirm this on Sunday, when he is also set tounveil a new Covid-19 alert system in England to track the virus. Meanwhile, Ms Dickinson believes the government's guidance will reflect her organisation's own advice on the practical measures that can be taken to promote staff and customer safety. These measures would include staggering shift times, managing the number of people in store, and the use of plastic screens at payment points. She said it is ""incumbent"" on retailers to ensure they can operate safely otherwise ""they shouldn't open"", adding that supermarkets have ""shown us the way"" over the past couple of months. Safety measures, she added, would ""give us confidence as shoppers, members of the public, that we can go out to shop"". She said a phased lifting of restrictions across different industries, with schools and transport addressed early on would help those retail staff with children.

In aletter to the Observer,external, the head of the shop workers' union, Usdaw, and three other major union leaders, said they will not recommend their members return to work unless the government guarantees ""the right policies and practices are in place to make workplaces safe"". ""The trade union movement wants to be able to recommend the government's back-to-work plans,"" the letter said. ""But for us to do that we need to ensure that ministers have listened and that we stay safe and save lives at work too."" Workers could also face issues getting to work. On Saturday, Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid even with public transport reverting to a full service, social distancing measures would leave effective capacity for only one in 10 passengers in many parts of the network. He urged people returning to work to walk or cycle, and announced pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors will be created in England within weeks as part of a Â£250m emergency fund. Ms Dickinson also urged the government to ensure we avoid ""a cliff edge of support falling way as soon as restrictions lifted"". She called for ""some form of tapering down"" of the government's job retention scheme,which is set to run until the end of June.

"Experts warn the infections may actually be higher due to low testing rates in many countries More than four million confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported around the world, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. The global death toll has also risen to above 277,000. The US remains the worst-hit country, accounting for over a quarter of confirmed cases and a third of deaths. Experts warn the true number of infections is likely to be far higher, with low testing rates in many countries skewing the data. Daily death tolls are continuing to drop in some nations, including Spain, but there is concern that easing lockdown restrictions could lead to a ""second wave"" of infections. In addition, governments are bracing for economic fallout as the pandemic hits global markets and supply chains. A senior Chinese official has told local media thatthe pandemic was a ""big test"" that had exposed weaknesses in the country's public health system. The rare admission, from the director of China's National Health Commission, Li Bin, comes after sustained criticism abroad of China's early response. In other recent developments: The UK government will proceed with ""extreme caution""while exiting lockdown restrictions, according to the country's transport secretary. China's president has expressed concern about the threat of the coronavirus to North Koreaand offered help. Former US President Barack Obama hasstrongly criticised Donald Trump over his response to the coronavirus crisis, calling it ""an absolute chaotic disaster"". Billionaire Tesla boss Elon Musk has said he willmove the electric carmaker's headquarters out of Californiabecause of local coronavirus restrictions. Three senior officials in the US are self-isolating after coming into contact with White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus - Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, and top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for riding a jetski on a lake as the national Congress announced three days of official mourning for victims of the pandemic Health officials in Ghana say more than 500 workers at an industrial facility have tested positive for coronavirus, while the total number of daily cases in the country has jumped by nearly 30% - just a day after authorities said infections had reached its peak. This week, some lockdown measures have begun easing in Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic.  Italians have been able to exercise outdoors and visit family members in their region. France has recorded its lowest daily number of coronavirus deaths for more than a month, with 80 deaths over the past 24 hours. Authorities are preparing to ease restrictions from Monday, as is the government in neighbouring Spain. Meanwhile lockdowns are continuing in countries like South Africa, despite calls from opposition parties for it to end. In South Korea, renewed restrictions are being imposed on bars and clubs after a series of transmissions linked to Seoul's leisure district. Russia also cancelled a military parade in Moscow, planned as part of the country's Victory Day celebrations. Instead, President Vladimir Putinhosted a subdued event on Saturday, laying roses at the Eternal Flame war memorial. But despite scientific evidence, leaders of several countries have continued to express scepticism about the virus and the need for lockdowns. In Belarus, thousands of soldiers marched to celebrate Victory Day, as President Alexander Lukashenko rejected calls for tougher measures. British medical journal The Lancet has written a scathing editorial about Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, calling him the biggest threat to his country's ability to contain the spread of coronavirus. Brazil is currently reporting the highest number of cases in Latin America - over 10,000 more on Saturday, bringing the national total to nearly 156,000. But despite the outbreak, President Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the virus' severity and has clashed with governors over lockdown measures. Frustrations about the outbreak turned violent in Afghanistan, andat least six people died during clashes between protesters and security forces. The violence started after demonstrators gathered in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor province, to complain about the government's perceived failure to help the poor during the pandemic.
