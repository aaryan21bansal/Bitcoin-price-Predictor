"Diesel prices in the UK rose by an average of more than 2p in a day as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil costs. The fuel jumped to a record Â£1.76 per litre on Tuesday, up from almost Â£1.74 on Monday. Petrol prices, which have also increased to record highs, rose to almost Â£1.65p a litre from about Â£1.64. The continuing price rises come amid warnings of potential global oil supply problems. Recent rises in the global price of oil has pushed up prices at the pumps in the UK, but there are hopes recent falls will transfer to cheaper fuel. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said drivers could save almost 4p a litre by buying their fuel at one of the big four supermarkets, where the average for petrol is 161p and 171p for diesel. ""We continue to remain hopeful that retailers will soon start to pass on recent reductions in the price of wholesale fuel to drivers when they next buy supply. That ought to lead to petrol stabilising at around 160p while diesel ought to stay where it is based on current wholesale prices,"" he said. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), whose members include major supermarkets which sell fuel, has said retailers understand the cost pressures facing motorists. Andrew Opie, of the BRC, said they would do everything they could to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The International Energy Agency (IEA) said high commodity prices and sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine were ""threatening to create a global oil supply shock"". It estimated three million barrels per day of Russian oil could be taken out of the global market as a result of international sanctions. The agency warned only Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have enough spare production capacity to offset the shortfall in Russian output, which it said was the largest oil exporter in the world. Russia continues to export oil for the time being due to deals and trades made before Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine, the IEA said. New business has all but dried up, however, because many Western countries are seeking alternative fuel supplies. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have banned Russian oil imports, but by contrast, the EU, which is much more reliant on Russian energy, has stopped short of a ban. Meanwhile, the UK has said it will phase out imports of Russian oil in response to Russia's actions by the end of the year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has travelled to discuss energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A Rosneft oil rig drilling the first exploration well in the Khatanga Bay, Russia The IEA said the world was ""faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades"", with global energy markets ""at a crossroads"". It added the ""implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets"" could not be understated. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought energy security back to the forefront of political agendas as commodity prices surge to new heights. While it is still too early to know how events will unfold, the crisis may result in lasting changes to energy markets,"" it said. The price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hovered around $100 per barrel on Wednesday, having previously reached record highs of more than $130 a barrel in the immediate aftermath of Western countries hitting Russia with sanctions. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, but is affected by the global shifts in price which are driven by supply and demand forces. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams said UK fuel prices had increased at the fastest rate on record, with petrol rising 13p since the start of the month and diesel increasing by nearly 21p. He said a full tank of unleaded for a family car was now almost Â£91 on average. UK motoring groups have said fuel prices are likely to fall as global oil prices stabilise. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. ""The big question is how keen will retailers be to pass on those savings at the pumps as they will no doubt be extremely conscious of protecting themselves from any more rises that could suddenly materialise,"" said Mr Williams. ""Drivers badly need a break from these relentless daily rises."" The RAC has called on the chancellor to cut fuel duty or VAT in his upcoming Spring Statement.

"It is almost six years since Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained by the Iranian authorities in April 2016. Since then there were repeated attempts to secure her release - all failed. So why has she now come home? The basic answer is London-Tehran relations are better than they have been. The International Revolutionary Guard and Iran's judiciary no longer feel they need Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for leverage in relations with the UK. Nazanin arrives in UK after being freed from Iran She was a diplomatic pawn held hostage by the Iranian authorities to put pressure on London. If Tehran wanted to make nice, they would treat her well, give her access to medical help, perhaps increase the frequency of visits, possibly even allow her a temporary furlough from jail. If Tehran wanted to exert pressure on London, then her conditions might worsen and privileges might be withdrawn. The UK paying the historic Â£400m debt for tanks sold but not delivered will have made a huge difference. For years, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) claimed the two issues were not connected. But in practice, the Iranians made them one and the same issue. Some in the FCDO had wanted to pay the debt but were prevented initially by reluctance within the Treasury and the United States, fearing it would reward hostage-taking and even fund terrorism. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on way home to UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals How is tank debt linked to Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe? There were also fears the US would penalise any British financial institution that paid the money to the Iranian defence ministry in breach of international sanctions. There is also the sheer relentlessness of the families' campaigning and the UK's diplomacy. At first there were mistakes, such as Boris Johnson's false claim that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran, a claim that prompted Iran to level fresh charges. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (right), pictured with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, who is now seven, was first detained by Iranian authorities in April 2016. But the tireless campaigning by Nazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and others kept up the pressure on the UK government. And that was reflected by the work of British diplomats behind the scenes, refusing to let Iran forget about the case. There was almost a deal to release the detainees last year. It fell through. But since then British diplomats have visited Iran several times to try to reach a fresh agreement. Iranian officials at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs were frequently frustrated that this dispute got in the way of the rest of the UK-Iran relationship. Mr Ratcliffe campaigned for his wife's release, including by going on hunger strike outside the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office last October. But the Iranian diplomats were not in charge - the IRGC and the judges were. Eventually, enough people with the Iranian government seemed to have realised that a permanently hostile relationship with the UK was not in Tehran's best interests. That might apply directly to the talks taking place in Vienna, designed to revive the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in return for seeing economic sanctions lifted. Iran's economy has been suffering, Iran clearly wants to agree a new deal, better relations with the UK might make that happen. The deal has still not been agreed but diplomats say agreement is getting close. And in recent weeks, during the Ukraine conflict, Britain and Iran's interests have also come closer together. If sanctions can be lifted and Iran can start selling its oil again, that could help reduce global energy prices. That is in the interests of both the UK and Iran. In that context, both sides might want to clear the diplomatic decks and make a deal more likely. Nazanin on her way home to 'new life' in UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Kurt Zouma plays for Premier League side West Ham while Yoan Zouma is at National League side Dagenham & Redbridge The RSPCA says it has started prosecution proceedings against Kurt Zouma and brother Yoan for their roles in filming Kurt kicking a cat. Dagenham & Redbridge's Yoan, 23,filmed 27-year-old Kurtkicking and slapping one of his pets. After the video appeared, the RSPCAremoved two catsfrom Kurt's home and began liaising with Essex Police about the incident. Kurt continued to play for West Ham despite the controversy. An RSPCA spokesperson said: ""Following a full and thorough investigation, we have started the process of bringing a prosecution against Kurt Zouma and Yoan Zouma under the Animal Welfare Act. ""The two cats continue to be cared for by the RSPCA. We will be in a position to release more information once a court date is confirmed."" West Ham said they were ""aware of the RSPCA statement in relation to its investigation"". The club added: ""Kurt continues to co-operate fully, supported by the club. It is our understanding that Kurt's cats have been checked by a vet, are in good health and have suffered no physical injuries. ""For legal reasons, neither Kurt or the club will be making any further comment at this time."" Following the incident, West Ham said they had fined the elder brother ""the maximum amount possible"" and the fee would be donated to animal welfare charities. However, Hammers sponsor Experience Kissimmee said it would end its deal with the club and another sponsor, Vitality, suspended its deal with the club. German sportswear firm Adidas also announced it had ended its deal with Kurt. National League club Dagenham & Redbridge suspended Yoan and he has only recently returned to the squad.

"The fine of Â£1,050,000 is the largest ever imposed by the Lloyd's Enforcement Board. Lloyd's of London has fined a member firm Â£1m due to some male managers' heavy drinking, initiation games and sexual remarks about female staff. Atrium Underwriters admitted charges relating to bullying and misconduct during annual 'boys' nights out'. Some of the inappropriate behaviour was led, participated in and condoned by two senior leaders, Lloyd's found. Atrium said it accepted the ruling, was sorry for the hurt caused and would ensure it never happened again. The fine of Â£1,050,000 is the largest ever imposed by Lloyd's independent disciplinary committee and its first for non-financial misconduct. Atrium must also pay Lloyd's costs of Â£562,713, the committee's report said. The findings followed an investigation by Lloyd's enforcement team. In a notice of censure,external, Lloyd's said Atrium had sanctioned and tolerated an annual boys' night out over a number of years up until 2018. On these nights out some male members of staff, including two senior executives in leadership roles, engaged in unprofessional and inappropriate conduct, Lloyds found. This included initiation games, heavy drinking and making inappropriate and sexualised comments about female colleagues. These comments were found to be discriminatory and harassing to female members of staff. Behaviour by one male staff member - called Employee A in the document - ""included a systematic campaign of bullying against a junior employee over a number of years"", Lloyd's found. Once Atrium became aware of the bullying it failed to investigate, take disciplinary action or adequately protect the junior employee, it said. ""Instead, Atrium negotiated a settlement package with Employee A, and allowed him to resign from Atrium rather than face disciplinary sanction,"" it said. The document noted that Atrium had a previously good disciplinary record and had co-operated at all times with Lloyd's inquiry and enforcement proceedings. It added Atrium had now implemented changes including ""updating its policies and procedures relating to disciplinary issues, whistleblowing and diversity and inclusion, as well as its guidance and training for senior managers"". Lloyd's chief executive, John Neal, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the behaviour highlighted by this case, and I want to be clear that discrimination, harassment and bullying have no place at Lloyd's."" Christopher Stooke, independent non-executive chairman at Atrium, said the firm had failed to live up to its values and had made serious errors in handling what happened. ""The behaviour outlined in the notice of censure has no place in our business or our industry, and we recognise that we must go further to ensure that this situation is never allowed to happen again,"" he said. In 2019, Lloyd's vowed to tackle its male dominated culture after almostone in ten workers said they had witnessed sexual harassment.

"This video can not be played President Putin ""did not understand what he would encounter"" in Ukraine, says Boris Johnson Ukraine is ""paying the price"" for the West's failure to understand the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, the PM says. Boris Johnson told the BBC the Russian president's invasion had ""already failed"" because he underestimated the ""strength of resistance"" in Ukraine. But he blamed European countries who ""went back to treating [Putin] as part of the community"" after his annexing of Crimea in 2014. Mr Johnson has been visiting Saudi Arabia, discussing energy security. He said the West needed to ensure it was ""never again vulnerable to Putin's blackmail"" - especially when it came to relying on Russian oil and gas. But Labour criticised Mr Johnson for the visit, saying he was going ""cap in hand from one dictator to another"". PM: I raised human rights with Saudi Arabia Will PM's trip find a way to plug the energy gap? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? During his trip, Mr Johnson met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for an hour and 45 minutes for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas. Afterwards, Downing Street said the UK and Saudi Arabia had ""agreed to collaborate to maintain stability in the energy market"" and boost renewable energy sources. A spokesman added the two countries had also agreed to boost co-operation in defence, security, trade and culture. However, a number of MPs had called on the PM to cancel the visit over the Saudi government's human rights record. Last week 81 men were executed in one day. The prime minister insisted that he did not ""turn a blind eye"" to the incidents and raised them with the country's officials. But he said he had to be ""realistic"" and ""look at the global picture"" when it came to energy security. President Vladimir Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea - a territory of Ukraine - in 2014. He subsequently backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the PM said: ""If you look back at 2014 and what happened when Putin took part of Crimea... what we totally failed to understand [was] the threat that he posed and we renormalized. ""European countries went back to treating him as though he was part of the community. ""Ukraine is paying the price for that now."" He also pointed to the strength of the resistance in Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin was committing war crimes in the country. Mr Johnson said: ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. ""He's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the of Ukrainian people."" LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Kyiv residents record life under siege ANALYSIS:Putin will search for a way to save face BUSINESS:The Western brands unable to leave Russia IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict After Russia began its invasion in Ukraine last month, numerous governments introduced sanctions to hit the country's economy. And many countries - including the UK - pledged to phase out their use of the country's oil and gas to hit it even harder. Mr Johnson said he planned to look to at solar, wind and to ""make some big bets"" on nuclear power going forward, but short-term solutions were also necessary. ""The UK has a historic and a long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, which goes back many, many decades,"" said the PM. ""That should not in any way stop us from raising issues of human rights."" He added: ""I want to be clear, we don't we don't just turn a blind eye, we don't wink at them, we don't ignore it, we raise it and we make the argument. ""But what we also try to do is look at the global picture and look at the the impact on the world economy, and particularly the impact on the UK [as a] consumer of hydrocarbons. ""We're in a transitional phase now and we've got to be realistic about the continuing transitional importance of hydrocarbons in our in our economies.""

"This video can not be played Video shows Mariupol theatre destroyed in bombing Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing a theatre where civilians were sheltering in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told the BBC that between 1,000 and 1,200 people had sought refuge in the building. While the number of casualties is unclear, a local MP said the basement where people were gathered had withstood the bombing. ""It looks like most of them have survived,"" Dmytro Gurin told the BBC. But Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor, earlier said emergency workers were struggling to reach the building due to constant shelling. Images of the theatre, verified by the BBC, showed extensive damage and smoke rising from the site. Russia's air strikes and shells have previously hit a maternity hospital, a church and apartment buildings. Mariupol's city council said in a statement that Russian forces ""deliberately and cynically destroyed"" the theatre, saying a ""plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding"". Both Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, and the city council accused Russia of a ""war crime"" in the wake of the attack. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the bombing and said Russia had deliberately targeted the theatre. ""Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol,"" he said in a video address late on Wednesday evening. Satellite pictures taken on 14 March - released by the US company Maxar - showed the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters to warn Russian jets away from the building. The BBC was earlier told that many children and elderly people were sheltering inside, and that conditions were quickly deteriorating. Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. An estimated 300,000 residents are trapped inside the city, where running water, electricity and gas have been cut off. Food and water supplies are running low, as Russian troops have not allowed the delivery of humanitarian aid. Hours after news of the destruction emerged, the Russian defence ministry denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre, the RIA news agency reported. About 1,500 cars had managed to flee Mariupol on Wednesday, according to Mr Orlov, the deputy mayor. But, he said, an attack by Russia on the convoy left at least five wounded, including a child. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called for better access to civilians caught up in the war, which he said was causing ""enormous suffering"". Mr Maurer, who arrived in Ukraine for a five-day visit, described the situation in Mariupol as a ""waking nightmare"". Elsewhere, at least 10 people waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv were killed by Russian shelling on Wednesday, the country's prosecutor general said. Unverified footage released by a local outlet showed bodies on a street.

"PC William Neville (left) and PC Jonathon Cobban remain suspended from duty Two serving Met police constables and an ex-officer have denied sharing grossly offensive messages with Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and former officer Joel Borders, 45, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court accused of the offences between April and August 2019. Couzens, 49, murdered Ms Everard last year while serving as a Met officer. All three defendants were released on bail and a trial was set for 28 July. PC Cobban, of Didcot, Oxfordshire, is charged with five counts of sending a grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message on a public electronic communications network, while PC Neville, of Weybridge, Surrey, is charged with two counts of the same offence. Wayne Couzens is serving a whole-life prison sentence Former Met officer Mr Borders, of Preston, Lancashire, also faces five counts of the same charge. The alleged offences took place two years before Couzens kidnapped Sarah Everard in a fake arrest in March 2021, before raping and murdering the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) previously said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. In court, the three spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and to enter not guilty pleas to each of the charges, during a hearing lasting about 20 minutes.

BBC Sport understands the Ricketts group bid also includes US hedge fund entrepreneur Ken Griffin. A statement on Wednesday from the Ricketts, who have had a majority interest in the Cubs since 2009, said they would share further details ""in due course"". ""The Ricketts Family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, can confirm they will be leading an investment group that will make a formal bid for Chelsea this Friday,"" the statement read. ""As long-time operators of an iconic professional sports team, the Ricketts Family and their partners understand the importance of investing for success on the pitch, while respecting the traditions of the club, the fans and the community."" The bid is described as ""very serious"" by one insider, with the family understood to have already done due diligence when they previously enquired about buying the club in 2018. Broughton, who announced his intention to buy Chelsea over the weekend, told the BBC ""I am absolutely delighted to welcome Lord Coe to our bid. His reputation speaks for itself, and he will bring phenomenal insight, leadership, and sporting knowledge to Chelsea Football Club."" His group is expected to submit a bid in the next 48 hours. Coe said he was ""certain that Sir Martin is the right man to lead Chelsea Football Club into its next chapter"" citing his ""exceptional track record in British business"". Coe added ""most importantly, like me, he is a lifelong Chelsea supporter and Shed End season ticket holder. I know that this bid is for the millions of Chelsea fans around the world. We love our club and will always put the fans first"". Broughton, 74, is a former British Airways chairman and now chairs private investment firm Sports Investment Partners. He was briefly Liverpool chairman in 2010. Those close to the consortium declined to tell BBC Sport who was financing the bid or who else was involved. Coe would take a seat on the Chelsea board if Broughton's bid is successful, according to the PA news agency. More than 20 credible parties are interested in buying the Premier League club. British businessman Nick Candysaid earlier this monthhe was exploring ""a number of options for a potential bid"". Former Chelsea striker Gianluca Vialli announced on Wednesday that he is working with Candy on his bid. Vialli co-owns Tifosy, a mergers and acquisitions company for the football sector. The former Italian international said: ""I am proud and feel very privileged to support Mr Candy's bid to buy Chelsea Football Club."" The 57-year-old added: ""We share the same view that if the bid is successful, we will try to be the best possible custodians of the club, knowing that it is imperative that supporter concerns are front and centre of any owner's priorities."" Chelsea sale could happen this month Is this a moment of reckoning for English football ownership? Only some of the interested parties or bidders have come forward so far: Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US businessman Todd Boehly have formed part of a consortium to try to take over Chelsea. Wyss told Swiss newspaperBlick,externalthat he had been offered the chance to buy the club. The 86-year-old is worth an estimated Â£3.9bn. Boehly, who is a part owner of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, was previously linked with a takeover of Chelsea in 2019. Muhsin Bayrak Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak says he is one of those to have launched a bid to buy the club, adding ""we will fly the Turkish flag in London soon"". Bayrak is chairman of AB Grup Holding, which he founded in 1999, and has investments in crypto currency, construction, tourism and energy sectors. Sources close to Bayrak told BBC Sport he is determined to buy Chelsea and his lawyer was set to be in London for talks last week. Others Other parties reported to be interested includeNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson,externaland aSaudi Arabia-based consortium.,external British billionaireJim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos and boughtFrench club Nice in 2019, has previously shown interest, but will not seek to purchase Chelsea because he does not see it as good value. The Ricketts family bought the Cubs in 2009 and renovated their Wrigley Field stadium as part of a push to create a winning team. The Cubs won the World Series title in 2016,ending a 108-year waitand the longest title drought in the game. It was estimated five million people attended the Cubs' victory parade in Chicago. Thomas Ricketts is chairman of the Cubs, while his siblings also sit on the board. The family also own a 25% stake in American TV network CSN Chicago. The American investment firm tasked with selling the club expects a sale could happen by the end of March following positive conversations with the UK government. One issue the bid already faces is the patriarch of the family - 80-year-old Joe Ricketts - and influential figure in conservative US politics, had to apologise in 2019 for anti-Muslim comments he made in leaked emails. A source close to the Ricketts camp told the BBC that Mr Ricketts would have no role or involvement in the bid for Chelsea, which is being headed up by his children Tom, Laura and Todd. Russian Abramovich had his British assets, which includes Chelsea, frozen last week and was disqualified as a director of the club. The Blues are allowed to continue operating aftera special licence was issued by the UK government, This also ensures Chelsea's staff are paid and allows existing season ticket holders to attend matches, but a new licence will need to be issued for the club to be sold. Abramovich has owned Chelsea since 2003, with the club winning 21 trophies during his tenure. Meanwhile, Uefa is seeking clarification from the European Union on future Champions League matches involving Chelsea. Abramovich wassanctioned by the EU on Tuesday.,external Wednesday's last-16 tie against Lille in France, where the Blues hold a2-0 advantage, went ahead. Thomas Tuchel's side are the current holders of the Champions League trophy after theybeat Manchester City 1-0 in last year's final. ""Uefa is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions,"" Uefa said. ""Our understanding is that the present case is assessed in the context of the licence issued in the UK which allows Chelsea FC to continue minimum football activity whilst providing a safeguard that no financial gain will result for Mr Abramovich. ""We will work with the EU and relevant member states to ensure we have full clarity and remain in lockstep with all relevant and applicable measures in line with latest developments."" Meanwhile, Chelsea will avoid a 10-hour round trip by bus for their FA Cup tie at Middlesbrough on Saturday after the government increased its cap for away travel as part of the club's operating licence. The cap was set at Â£20,000 after Abramovich was sanctioned, as part of a set of conditions to allow the club to run day-to-day. But the increase will allow the team to fly to the North East for the quarter-final tie. Chelsea's players and staff flew to Lille for Wednesday's Champions League tie because it was already arranged prior to the sanctions. A Chelsea spokesman said: ""We are grateful for the government's continued attention to our requests for amendments to the licence."" The government has already increased spending for home matches from Â£500,000 to Â£900,000, with talks continuing over ticket, retail and merchandise revenue.

"Edwin Poots has said he wants farmers to grow more potatoes and cereal crops in response to the Ukraine war Agriculture minister Edwin Poots has warned of potential grain shortages and price rises as the war in Ukraine continues. He confirmed he had asked Stormont's finance department for Â£70m to help farmers hit by supply issues. Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of basic foodstuffs, and the war has hit crop production, driving up prices. Mr Poots has asked the UK government to press the EU torelax rules on importing agriculture seeds. He has said he wants farmers to grow more potatoes and cereal crops in response to the war. The seed trade comes under the Northern Ireland Protocol - part of the Brexit deal -and involves an onerous import process,external. Mr Poots told members of his assembly scrutiny committee he had ""grave concerns that the longer the conflict continues the more likely we are to see a real and damaging impact on local industries"". He said the consequences of supply chain difficulties could be ""brutal"" and consumers would see less choice on the shelves. ""The Northern Ireland agricultural food sector had already undergone a period of severe disruption as a result of the Covid pandemic and unworkable complexities of the Northern Ireland protocol,"" he added. About 40% of Northern Ireland's corn supply is sourced from Ukraine, he said. Mr Poots said some pig farmers are at risk of going out of business Mr Poots also said much of the grain exported from Ukraine was used for animal feed, and warned that a fall in supply will have significant consequences for the chicken, pork and dairy industries. He continued to say some pig farmers are at risk of going out of business as the problems are most acute in the pork sector. Northern Ireland also rely on nitrogen fertiliser imported from Russia so a reduction in supply would also result in lower crop yields. ""There is not going to be cheap fertiliser,"" he said. ""The question is, is there is going to be fertiliser? There will be fertiliser at a price."" On the issue of fuel, the minister said he hoped people would show common sense. ""If people stop panic buying then that would be a good thing and perhaps prices would settle a bit,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Poots met his ministerial counterparts from across the UK to discuss the difficulties the war in Ukraine was causing to the food supply chain in Northern Ireland. He also confirmed he had written to George Eustice, the UK Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to urge greater Government intervention. ""Alongside reductions in labour supply, rising input costs, supply chain disruptions and concerns about long-running inflation, they're all combining to create that perfect storm,"" said the Agriculture minister. ""It is vital we protect Northern Ireland's food supplies, making sure everyone can access safe quality food at prices that are affordable.""

"Kurt Zouma plays for Premier League side West Ham while Yoan Zouma is at National League side Dagenham & Redbridge The RSPCA says it has started prosecution proceedings against Kurt Zouma and brother Yoan for their roles in filming Kurt kicking a cat.

"This video can not be played President Putin ""did not understand what he would encounter"" in Ukraine, says Boris Johnson Ukraine is ""paying the price"" for the West's failure to understand the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, the PM says. Boris Johnson told the BBC the Russian president's invasion had ""already failed"" because he underestimated the ""strength of resistance"" in Ukraine. But he blamed European countries who ""went back to treating [Putin] as part of the community"" after his annexing of Crimea in 2014. Mr Johnson has been visiting Saudi Arabia, discussing energy security. He said the West needed to ensure it was ""never again vulnerable to Putin's blackmail"" - especially when it came to relying on Russian oil and gas. But Labour criticised Mr Johnson for the visit, saying he was going ""cap in hand from one dictator to another"". PM: I raised human rights with Saudi Arabia Will PM's trip find a way to plug the energy gap? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? During his trip, Mr Johnson met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for an hour and 45 minutes for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas. Afterwards, Downing Street said the UK and Saudi Arabia had ""agreed to collaborate to maintain stability in the energy market"" and boost renewable energy sources. A spokesman added the two countries had also agreed to boost co-operation in defence, security, trade and culture. However, a number of MPs had called on the PM to cancel the visit over the Saudi government's human rights record. Last week 81 men were executed in one day. The prime minister insisted that he did not ""turn a blind eye"" to the incidents and raised them with the country's officials. But he said he had to be ""realistic"" and ""look at the global picture"" when it came to energy security. President Vladimir Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea - a territory of Ukraine - in 2014. He subsequently backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the PM said: ""If you look back at 2014 and what happened when Putin took part of Crimea... what we totally failed to understand [was] the threat that he posed and we renormalized. ""European countries went back to treating him as though he was part of the community. ""Ukraine is paying the price for that now."" He also pointed to the strength of the resistance in Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin was committing war crimes in the country. Mr Johnson said: ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. ""He's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the of Ukrainian people."" LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Kyiv residents record life under siege ANALYSIS:Putin will search for a way to save face BUSINESS:The Western brands unable to leave Russia IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict After Russia began its invasion in Ukraine last month, numerous governments introduced sanctions to hit the country's economy. And many countries - including the UK - pledged to phase out their use of the country's oil and gas to hit it even harder. Mr Johnson said he planned to look to at solar, wind and to ""make some big bets"" on nuclear power going forward, but short-term solutions were also necessary. ""The UK has a historic and a long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, which goes back many, many decades,"" said the PM. ""That should not in any way stop us from raising issues of human rights."" He added: ""I want to be clear, we don't we don't just turn a blind eye, we don't wink at them, we don't ignore it, we raise it and we make the argument. ""But what we also try to do is look at the global picture and look at the the impact on the world economy, and particularly the impact on the UK [as a] consumer of hydrocarbons. ""We're in a transitional phase now and we've got to be realistic about the continuing transitional importance of hydrocarbons in our in our economies.""

"Teddie's injuries would have had him ""screaming in pain"", the trial had heard The former partner of a man who murdered a 12-week-old baby said she warned police ""if you do not stop him"" he would kill a woman or child. Kane Mitchellkilled his then partner's son Teddieat the flat they shared in St Neots, Cambridgeshire in 2019. A previous partner of Mitchell's told the BBC she ""tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously"". A child safeguarding practice review into Teddie's death is ongoing. In February 2021 Mitchell was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after being found guilty of murder, while the boy's mother Lucci Smith was sentenced for cruelty to a child. Kane Mitchell and Lucci Smith raised Teddie as if Mitchell was the father Mitchell, who was not Teddie's father but was raising him, assaulted the boy on 1 November 2019. Teddie died in hospital 10 days later and was found to have suffered 17 rib fractures, fractures to his right collarbone, a fatal skull fracture, and brain, spinal and eye injuries. The trial was told of numerous interactions between the family and the authorities, including after a fight between Smith and Mitchell in September 2019 when a social worker raised the issue of domestic violence with Smith while her partner was in the flat. A month before Teddie was born Smith received a letter from social services following an anonymous tip-off. Around this time a multi-agency safeguarding hub report was made, but social services in Cambridgeshire reviewed the case and felt no further action was required. This video can not be played Listen: Lucci Smith was advised to ""call an ambulance immediately"" The killer's former partner Olivia (not her real name), has told the BBC she was abused by Mitchell and that the police came to the house ""26 or 27 times"". ""They had pictures, videos - my face was all bruised, my lips. I had bruises all over my cheeks, handprints round my throat and they had all that evidence and nothing was done, nothing,"" she said. She said on one occasion Mitchell tipped hot curry over her head after going ""ballistic"" when a bit of rice went over him during a food fight. Olivia said: ""I told the police if you do not stop him he's going end up killing me... or a woman or a child. I told the police that's what he'll do and I meant it. It's got now to a baby dying because they didn't listen. ""I tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously - they didn't do enough, and now a poor baby has died, and I know in my heart I did everything I could."" Teddie Mitchell's mother called him a ""perfect little baby"" but was convicted of cruelty to a child She said that social services also told her Mitchell ""wasn't allowed around my children"". ""If he wasn't allowed around my children, then why would he be allowed around anyone else's children? If he was violent towards me, why wouldn't he be a risk to other women?,"" she said. ""I'm upset that a poor baby had to die for him [Mitchell] to be where he is. I'm upset that my children had to go through what they went through, their lives destroyed, for that to happen. They weren't listened to. I wasn't listened to."" The BBC understands the local child safeguarding practice review was originally due to be published in January - the same month a Channel 4 documentary on Teddie's murder was broadcast. However, the review has still not been made public and there remains no confirmed date for this. A review into Teddie's death is still ongoing The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Safeguarding Partnership Board said the report, written by an independent author, would be published ""imminently"". A spokesperson said the board ""felt it essential to allow sufficient time to gain accounts from relevant parties including family members"". A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesperson said it welcomed the review, adding: ""It is essential that lessons are learned. ""Until the review is published it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on or anticipate the findings of the report. ""We continue to improve our safeguarding best practice and all of us who have a role in protecting our children do so with absolute dedication to their safety and wellbeing. We will take on board any actions and recommendations made in the review."" Cambridgeshire Police said it had ""fully supported"" the ongoing review. The force added: ""We will, of course, take on board and action any learnings which come from the review.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one of the few western leaders to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine. He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"". But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy. PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial? But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships. In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman. When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"". Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a Â£1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"". The prime minister inspected a guard of honour after arriving at Abu Dhabi airport Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody. He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers. Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups. Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies. One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties. The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy. But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi. Saudis execute 81 men in one day US softens towards Saudis after murder snub He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"". He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said. ""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful."" Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years. That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy. But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"". With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options. Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored. Read more from Laura here. The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"". ""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borckâ, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says. ""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC. He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer says that âgoing cap-in-hand from dictator to dictatorâ is not an energy policy. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day. The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow. Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"". The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congressby video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori arrive at RAF Brize Norton Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran for nearly six years - is back in the UK. Her release - and that of another dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori - has been linked to the payment by the UK of a multi-million pound debt to Iran, over a failed arms deal dating back 40 years. 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after six-year ordeal in Iran Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? In the 1970s the Shah of Iran - the pro-Western monarch who then ruled the country - ordered1,500 Chieftain tanks and 250 Armoured Recovery Vehicles from the UK,externalin a deal worth an estimated Â£650m. The money was paid to International Military Services (IMS), a private company, then a subsidiary of the UK's Ministry of Defence. Only 185 of the tanks were delivered to the Iranian authorities before the Shah was deposed in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The Iranian government has been trying to regain the money for the undelivered tanks ever since. Iran ordered 1,500 Chieftain tanks from the UK (here shown in a British army photo from 1968) In 1990, Iran took IMS to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a global business organisation which rules on trade disputes between countries. In 2001, a hearing found in favour of Iran. IMS appealed, although in 2002 it agreed to pay Â£328.5m to the court, in case its appeal was unsuccessful. The appeal hearings concluded in 2009 and the decision was upheld in favour of Iran. However, the European Union had placed sanctions on Iran in June 2008, and IMS's payment was not released to the Iranians. The UK government admitted it owed Iran for the undelivered tanks, but said it could not make the payment while Iran was still subject to economic sanctions. In addition, there was the complicating factor of how much the UK owed Iran. The Â£328.5m security payment made by IMS in 2002 has attracteda considerable amount of interest,externalsince then. The UK disputed how much of this should be paid to Iran. The British-Iranian was detained in April 2016, and spent nearly six years in detention for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government. She protested her innocence throughout this time. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she had been told by her captors that her imprisonment was connected to the fact that the UK had not paid its debt. In 2021, the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Iran was linking her case and the unpaid debt. He said: ""I think they [Iran] are trying to use this as leverage to settle the historic debt for the Chieftain tanks and that's what they want settled. We obviously reject any linkage because we don't want to encourage hostage diplomacy and we want to follow the legal processes."" However, the UK government did not admit that her jailing, or the imprisonment of other dual nationalssuch as retired engineer Anoosheh Ashoori,were connected to the money. ""These are two entirely separate issues,""Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in 2021. 2021: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family protest in Whitehall, central London Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori were released after months of talks between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and her Iranian counterpart. Another dual national, Morad Tahbaz, has also been released from jail in Iran on furlough as part of the deal. Ms Truss has announced the UK settled the IMS debt ""in parallel"" to the prisoner release. She told MPs that ""highly complex"" negotiations led to the government finding a way to make a payment of Â£393.8m, and that the payment complied with existing sanctions, global counterterrorism financing rules and anti-money laundering regulations. Ms Truss said the terms would remain confidential, but added that Iran could only use the funds for humanitarian purposes.

"The fine of Â£1,050,000 is the largest ever imposed by the Lloyd's Enforcement Board. Lloyd's of London has fined a member firm Â£1m due to some male managers' heavy drinking, initiation games and sexual remarks about female staff. Atrium Underwriters admitted charges relating to bullying and misconduct during annual 'boys' nights out'. Some of the inappropriate behaviour was led, participated in and condoned by two senior leaders, Lloyd's found. Atrium said it accepted the ruling, was sorry for the hurt caused and would ensure it never happened again. The fine of Â£1,050,000 is the largest ever imposed by Lloyd's independent disciplinary committee and its first for non-financial misconduct. Atrium must also pay Lloyd's costs of Â£562,713, the committee's report said. The findings followed an investigation by Lloyd's enforcement team. In a notice of censure,external, Lloyd's said Atrium had sanctioned and tolerated an annual boys' night out over a number of years up until 2018. On these nights out some male members of staff, including two senior executives in leadership roles, engaged in unprofessional and inappropriate conduct, Lloyds found. This included initiation games, heavy drinking and making inappropriate and sexualised comments about female colleagues. These comments were found to be discriminatory and harassing to female members of staff. Behaviour by one male staff member - called Employee A in the document - ""included a systematic campaign of bullying against a junior employee over a number of years"", Lloyd's found. Once Atrium became aware of the bullying it failed to investigate, take disciplinary action or adequately protect the junior employee, it said. ""Instead, Atrium negotiated a settlement package with Employee A, and allowed him to resign from Atrium rather than face disciplinary sanction,"" it said. The document noted that Atrium had a previously good disciplinary record and had co-operated at all times with Lloyd's inquiry and enforcement proceedings. It added Atrium had now implemented changes including ""updating its policies and procedures relating to disciplinary issues, whistleblowing and diversity and inclusion, as well as its guidance and training for senior managers"". Lloyd's chief executive, John Neal, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the behaviour highlighted by this case, and I want to be clear that discrimination, harassment and bullying have no place at Lloyd's."" Christopher Stooke, independent non-executive chairman at Atrium, said the firm had failed to live up to its values and had made serious errors in handling what happened. ""The behaviour outlined in the notice of censure has no place in our business or our industry, and we recognise that we must go further to ensure that this situation is never allowed to happen again,"" he said.

"It is almost six years since Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained by the Iranian authorities in April 2016. Since then there were repeated attempts to secure her release - all failed. So why has she now come home? The basic answer is London-Tehran relations are better than they have been. The International Revolutionary Guard and Iran's judiciary no longer feel they need Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for leverage in relations with the UK. Nazanin arrives in UK after being freed from Iran She was a diplomatic pawn held hostage by the Iranian authorities to put pressure on London. If Tehran wanted to make nice, they would treat her well, give her access to medical help, perhaps increase the frequency of visits, possibly even allow her a temporary furlough from jail. If Tehran wanted to exert pressure on London, then her conditions might worsen and privileges might be withdrawn. The UK paying the historic Â£400m debt for tanks sold but not delivered will have made a huge difference. For years, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) claimed the two issues were not connected. But in practice, the Iranians made them one and the same issue. Some in the FCDO had wanted to pay the debt but were prevented initially by reluctance within the Treasury and the United States, fearing it would reward hostage-taking and even fund terrorism. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on way home to UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals How is tank debt linked to Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe? There were also fears the US would penalise any British financial institution that paid the money to the Iranian defence ministry in breach of international sanctions. There is also the sheer relentlessness of the families' campaigning and the UK's diplomacy. At first there were mistakes, such as Boris Johnson's false claim that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran, a claim that prompted Iran to level fresh charges. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (right), pictured with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, who is now seven, was first detained by Iranian authorities in April 2016. But the tireless campaigning by Nazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and others kept up the pressure on the UK government. And that was reflected by the work of British diplomats behind the scenes, refusing to let Iran forget about the case. There was almost a deal to release the detainees last year. It fell through. But since then British diplomats have visited Iran several times to try to reach a fresh agreement. Iranian officials at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs were frequently frustrated that this dispute got in the way of the rest of the UK-Iran relationship. Mr Ratcliffe campaigned for his wife's release, including by going on hunger strike outside the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office last October. But the Iranian diplomats were not in charge - the IRGC and the judges were. Eventually, enough people with the Iranian government seemed to have realised that a permanently hostile relationship with the UK was not in Tehran's best interests. That might apply directly to the talks taking place in Vienna, designed to revive the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in return for seeing economic sanctions lifted. Iran's economy has been suffering, Iran clearly wants to agree a new deal, better relations with the UK might make that happen. The deal has still not been agreed but diplomats say agreement is getting close. And in recent weeks, during the Ukraine conflict, Britain and Iran's interests have also come closer together. If sanctions can be lifted and Iran can start selling its oil again, that could help reduce global energy prices. That is in the interests of both the UK and Iran. In that context, both sides might want to clear the diplomatic decks and make a deal more likely. Nazanin on her way home to 'new life' in UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies. Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. Markah watches in tears. ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes. Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional. The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C. In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. Walid is given oxygen At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital. He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted. Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" Naseebullah with his sister Farzana In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says. ""We eat just dry bread.

"Teddie's injuries would have had him ""screaming in pain"", the trial had heard The former partner of a man who murdered a 12-week-old baby said she warned police ""if you do not stop him"" he would kill a woman or child. Kane Mitchellkilled his then partner's son Teddieat the flat they shared in St Neots, Cambridgeshire in 2019. A previous partner of Mitchell's told the BBC she ""tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously"". A child safeguarding practice review into Teddie's death is ongoing. In February 2021 Mitchell was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after being found guilty of murder, while the boy's mother Lucci Smith was sentenced for cruelty to a child. Kane Mitchell and Lucci Smith raised Teddie as if Mitchell was the father Mitchell, who was not Teddie's father but was raising him, assaulted the boy on 1 November 2019. Teddie died in hospital 10 days later and was found to have suffered 17 rib fractures, fractures to his right collarbone, a fatal skull fracture, and brain, spinal and eye injuries. The trial was told of numerous interactions between the family and the authorities, including after a fight between Smith and Mitchell in September 2019 when a social worker raised the issue of domestic violence with Smith while her partner was in the flat. A month before Teddie was born Smith received a letter from social services following an anonymous tip-off. Around this time a multi-agency safeguarding hub report was made, but social services in Cambridgeshire reviewed the case and felt no further action was required. This video can not be played Listen: Lucci Smith was advised to ""call an ambulance immediately"" The killer's former partner Olivia (not her real name), has told the BBC she was abused by Mitchell and that the police came to the house ""26 or 27 times"". ""They had pictures, videos - my face was all bruised, my lips. I had bruises all over my cheeks, handprints round my throat and they had all that evidence and nothing was done, nothing,"" she said. She said on one occasion Mitchell tipped hot curry over her head after going ""ballistic"" when a bit of rice went over him during a food fight. Olivia said: ""I told the police if you do not stop him he's going end up killing me... or a woman or a child. I told the police that's what he'll do and I meant it. It's got now to a baby dying because they didn't listen. ""I tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously - they didn't do enough, and now a poor baby has died, and I know in my heart I did everything I could."" Teddie Mitchell's mother called him a ""perfect little baby"" but was convicted of cruelty to a child She said that social services also told her Mitchell ""wasn't allowed around my children"". ""If he wasn't allowed around my children, then why would he be allowed around anyone else's children? If he was violent towards me, why wouldn't he be a risk to other women?,"" she said. ""I'm upset that a poor baby had to die for him [Mitchell] to be where he is. I'm upset that my children had to go through what they went through, their lives destroyed, for that to happen. They weren't listened to. I wasn't listened to."" The BBC understands the local child safeguarding practice review was originally due to be published in January - the same month a Channel 4 documentary on Teddie's murder was broadcast. However, the review has still not been made public and there remains no confirmed date for this. A review into Teddie's death is still ongoing The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Safeguarding Partnership Board said the report, written by an independent author, would be published ""imminently"". A spokesperson said the board ""felt it essential to allow sufficient time to gain accounts from relevant parties including family members"". A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesperson said it welcomed the review, adding: ""It is essential that lessons are learned. ""Until the review is published it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on or anticipate the findings of the report. ""We continue to improve our safeguarding best practice and all of us who have a role in protecting our children do so with absolute dedication to their safety and wellbeing. We will take on board any actions and recommendations made in the review."" Cambridgeshire Police said it had ""fully supported"" the ongoing review. The force added: ""We will, of course, take on board and action any learnings which come from the review. This forms a part of our continual review processes which strives to embed learning and best practice from local and national reviews. ""As the review has yet to be published, it is not appropriate for us to pre-empt the findings and recommendations.""

"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies. Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. Markah watches in tears. ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes. Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional. The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C. In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. Walid is given oxygen At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital. He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted. Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" Naseebullah with his sister Farzana In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says. ""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry."" Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families. Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die.

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

"PC William Neville (left) and PC Jonathon Cobban remain suspended from duty Two serving Met police constables and an ex-officer have denied sharing grossly offensive messages with Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and former officer Joel Borders, 45, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court accused of the offences between April and August 2019. Couzens, 49, murdered Ms Everard last year while serving as a Met officer. All three defendants were released on bail and a trial was set for 28 July. PC Cobban, of Didcot, Oxfordshire, is charged with five counts of sending a grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message on a public electronic communications network, while PC Neville, of Weybridge, Surrey, is charged with two counts of the same offence. Wayne Couzens is serving a whole-life prison sentence Former Met officer Mr Borders, of Preston, Lancashire, also faces five counts of the same charge. The alleged offences took place two years before Couzens kidnapped Sarah Everard in a fake arrest in March 2021, before raping and murdering the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) previously said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. In court, the three spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and to enter not guilty pleas to each of the charges, during a hearing lasting about 20 minutes.

"Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, says Ukraine's railway staff have helped an estimated 2.5 million people to reach safety There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs. The Russians would like to kill him. Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover. ""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me. The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe. So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed. ""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin. When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room. Mr Kamyshin keeps his guards and advisors close There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says. Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west. Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations. ""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says. His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv. Mr Kamyshin is convinced he is a target for Russian forces He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago. Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south. Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west."" It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid. Since Russia's invasion began, thousands of people have been packing train platforms daily to travel to safer locations He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening. ""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West."" My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group. The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked. ""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving. ""We will keep the trains running as long as we can. There is no other option for us.""

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw On day 20 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, residents in the capital Kyiv were placed under a 35-hour curfew - but that didn't stop the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic from travelling there by train. The trip was a Polish idea, after the EU warned of potential security risks. The leaders decided to go by trainbecause flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reported. It was not immediately clear when their train would make the return trip to Warsaw. Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki said history was being made in Ukraine's capital. ""It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,"" he tweeted. Mr Morawiecki added that Ukraine could count on the help of its friends. The prime ministers sat down for a briefing with their Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmyhal, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked them for the ""powerful"" gesture of support. They were accompanied to Ukraine by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. Russian artillery and warplanes are continuing to pound cities and towns across Ukraine. In Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east,hundreds of people crammed into the basement of a large public buildingare running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help, the BBC's Hugo Bachega was told. ""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but is in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious."" Her friends are with other families who spend most of their day in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for sunlight, but rarely outside. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing. A satellite image shows fires burning following Russian strikes in residential area of eastern Mariupol, Ukraine At an intensive care hospital on the western outskirts of the city, staff described being treated like hostages by Russian forces. One employee was quoted as saying that Russian troops had ""forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital,"" adding: ""We can't leave."" The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the facility had been all but destroyed by shelling in recent days, but that staff had continued to treat patients in the basement. Separately, about 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route, according to city authorities. Before the war around 400,000 people lived in the city, which has endured intense bombardment by Russian forces. The city council says well over 2,000 civilians have died. A cameraman and a journalist working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, staff at the US network said. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski (left) and journalist Oleksandra Kuvshinova (seen here wearing a helmet and protective vest) Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott describedthe deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24,as ""heart-breaking"". Their colleague, 39-year-old Benjamin Hall, was also wounded in the incident and taken to hospital. The attack followed the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin. The Russian journalist who protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and shared a video describing the invasion as a crime was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£214; $280) and released. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel One, was detainedon Monday after she ran onto the set holding a sign saying ""no war"". But concerns were later raised over her safety after reports that she could not be contacted. On Tuesday, however, she appeared at a court hearing. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters afterwards that she had gone two days with no sleep, had been questioned for over 14 hours, and was not given access to legal help. Fears that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might lose his lift back to Earth on board a Russian capsule were thankfully put to bed whenit was confirmed he would indeed be making the trip home. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei has spent 355 days in space - a new US record The American, and two other Russian cosmonauts, will be brought back, landing in Kazakhstan. Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager, said: ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that."" Meanwhile, as Western nations impose further sanctions on Russia,Moscow retaliated on Tuesday by slapping sanctions on US President Joe Bidenand 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But there were also a couple of surprises on the list: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son, Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country.

"Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said he's ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory, raising the fear he might use a small, or ""tactical"" nuclear weapon in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden has warned him that doing so would be the most serious military escalation since World War II. Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. They are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout. The smallest tactical nuclear weapons can be one kiloton or less (producing the equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT). The largest ones can be as big as 100 kilotons. Strategic nuclear weapons are larger (up to 1,000 kilotons) and are launched from longer range. By comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons. According to US intelligence, Russia has aboutabout 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons,external. Its tactical nuclear warheads can be placed on various types of missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives, such as cruise missiles and artillery shells. Tactical nuclear weapons can also be fired from aircraft and ships - as anti-ship missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. The US says Russia has recently been investing heavily in these weapons to improve their range and accuracy. How many nuclear weapons does Russia have? What are the nuclear risks? Tactical nuclear weapons have never been used in conflict. Nuclear powers such as the US and Russia have found it equally effective to destroy targets on the battlefield by using modern conventional munitions. In addition, no nuclear-armed country has so far been willing to risk unleashing all-out nuclear war by employing tactical nuclear weapons. However, Russia might be more willing to use smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles. ""They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold,"" says Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the Chatham House think tank. ""They could see it as part of their conventional forces."" Russian forces can fire small nuclear warheads using conventional artillery, such as the ""Malka"" self-propelled gun In February 2022, shortly before invading Ukraine, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces at ""special combat readiness"" and held high-profile nuclear drills. More recently, he said: ""If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will without a doubt use all available means to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff."" Russia is planning to annex the regions of southern and eastern Ukraine it has occupied after holding self-styled referendums. President Putin says he is ready to defend the ""territorial integrity"" of the regions ""by all means."" US intelligence see this as a threat to the West not to help Ukraine try and retake these territories, rather than as a sign that he is planning a nuclear war. But others worry that Russia, if it suffers further setbacks, might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine as a ""game changer"", to break a stalemate or avoid defeat. James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pace in Washington DC, says: ""I am legitimately worried that in that circumstance, Putin might use a nuclear weapon - most likely on the ground in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way. We are not at that point yet."" US President Joe Bidenhas warned Russia not to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. Speaking during an interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said such action would ""change the face of war unlike anything since World War Two,"" adding: ""It'll be consequential."" How the US and Nato would respond to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want to draw a line. However, Russia might also be deterred from using tactical nuclear weapons by another power - China. ""Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese support,"" says Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings College London. ""But China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. ""If he used them, he would probably lose China.""

"When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, 27-year-old Nigerian Ottah Abraham was outraged. He picked up his phone and tweeted: ""I want to join the team."" He was some 8,700km (5,400 miles) away from the front line, in a small apartment in Nigeria's main city, Lagos. The philosophy graduate is one of several hundred Africans, from countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Algeria, who say they are willing to take up arms in the battle against Russia, partly to escape the bleak prospects faced by many young men at home. ""We know that it's war, it's not child's play,"" he told the BBC. ""But being a soldier in Ukraine would be better than being here. ""I'll probably be allowed to stay if the war ends, plus I'll be a hero and fight an undeniable enemy."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that some 20,000 volunteers from across the world had already applied to enlist. They came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a global appeal for foreign fighters to ""come and stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians"". The government has temporarily axed its visa requirements and offered equipment and a salary to those with a valid passport and military training. There has been no official confirmation that foreign fighters will be allowed to stay in the country after the war. Kereti Usoroh, a Nigerian living in the capital, Abuja, said his motivations for volunteering had nothing to do with financial gain or the prospect of citizenship. ""I already live a comfortable life. If I wanted to go to Europe, I'd do it through education, not war,"" the 29-year-old lawyer said. ""This is about beating a bully - injustice for one is injustice for all."" Sentiments to gladden the hearts of Ukrainian diplomats and days after President Zelenksy's appeal, dozens of hopeful volunteers headed to the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, with ambitions of enlisting. But the Ukrainian embassy in Nigeria - like others in Africa - has had to back-pedal as many of the continent's governments do not want their nationals to fight in Ukraine. ""Nigeria discourages the use of mercenaries anywhere in the world and will not tolerate the recruitment,"" Nigeria's foreign ministry wrote in a statement. Bohdan Soltys, a Ukrainian embassy official in Nigeria, said they were not paying Africans to fight - and people would have to pay for their own flights to reach Europe. ""There's a fine line between foreign volunteers and mercenaries,"" he told the BBC. A British paramedic was pictured crossing into Ukraine on 5 March to join the international legion He later clarified that he had been instructed to turn away any volunteers who arrived at the embassy. Senegal also warned its citizens against enlisting in the war and ordered the Ukrainian ambassador to take down a Facebook post that had called for Senegalese volunteers, calling the recruitment effort ""illegal and punishable by law."" The Algerian foreign ministry issued a similar order to its Ukrainian embassy. ""My country says I'm not allowed to go. I tried writing to the foreign ministry. They didn't answer me, but I will try again,"" 28-year-old Algerian Belhadj Hani Amir told the BBC. ""I want to go to Ukraine, but I also hope this war ends as soon as possible."" Ukraine's ambassador to South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana Liubov Abravitova told the BBC that hundreds of people from across southern African had volunteered to fight or work in a humanitarian capacity - but she was unable to act on their requests as she was waiting for instructions from their governments. South Africa has a strict law against mercenaries. In fact, Ukraine's official website for recruiting the ""international legion"" of volunteers, which provides the contact details of local embassies around the world, no longer includes missions in African countries. A representative working for the website confirmed that some African countries were removed because of ""regulatory restrictions"". Algeria, Senegal and South Africa were among 17 of Africa's 54 countries which abstained from the vote at the UN to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, as they wanted to avoid antagonising Russia. A pro-Russian rally was held in Bangui, capital of CAR, earlier this month And Russia is not without support in Africa. It hasexpanded its influence on the continent- especially militarily, by helping countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Mali and Sudan fight rebels or Islamist militants. A video purporting to show soldiers from CAR vowing to join their ""Russian brothers"" has also been circulating online, though the BBC could not independently verify the source and a government official has not responded to a request for comment. Last Friday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that ""over 16,000 fighters"" from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army - it is not clear if this includes any from North Africa. But with African governments clamping down on the recruitment of their own citizens, it is unclear if any of the men will make it to the front line - and a Ukrainian official in charge of registering foreign volunteers told the BBC that no Africans had arrived. For some, like David Osagie Adeleke from Nigeria's south-western Oyo state, this was a devastating blow. Prince Nkem Nduche (L), who wanted to fight in Ukraine, trained in Russia at a military academy several years ago The 21-year-old, who has worked as an emergency rescue worker for the Red Cross, had been preparing to enlist as a combatant, having collected the necessary documentation, including a letter of recommendation. ""I went straight to the police station to collect my documents,"" he said, explaining that a clean criminal record was one of the requirements for enlisting. ""I'm disappointed to hear that the embassy is now saying it won't take us Africans."" With his emails to the Ukrainian embassy now bouncing back, he is looking into alternative routes to get to the country's border. ""I've got an interview with the Polish embassy in Nigeria,"" he said. Prince Nkem Nduche, who was among those at the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, has more knowledge than most about the situation in Ukraine and is more sanguine. He actually spent some time in Russia as a youngster, has dual citizenship and even enrolled at Russia's military academy - but was jailed for a short time, accused of being a spy after he was spotted at the American embassy. He said he fled the country seven years ago, via Ukraine - and would happily fight against Russia, but accepts it is not to be. ""I wanted to go on my own but as the Nigerian government said we can't goâ¦ I will obey them,"" he told the BBC.

Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme The US says it has warned Russia of ""consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"". Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone on Wednesday with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, General Nikolay Patrushev. The White House said it had requested the call, its highest-level diplomatic engagement with Moscow since a February call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Both countries have accused the other of housing and preparing to use biological weapons inside Ukraine. General Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him since the 1970s. Here's more on the general and other members of Putin's inner circle. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has left the Bolshoi Ballet, Russia's internationally renowned company, after saying she is ""against war with all the fibres of my soul"". She joins the Dutch National Ballet, which describes her as one of the Bolshoi's leading stars, and that it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue working in Russia after she condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, she said on Telegram: ""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after. ""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes."" You can read more about Smirnova's move here. The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest update on Russia's military, saying that it has probably had to resort to using older and less precise weapons, which are more likely to result in civilian casualties. It adds that Russia probably resorted to using these weapons as a result of failing to achieve its military objectives. So far the UN has confirmed the deaths of 729 civilians in Ukraine, though the actual number is expected to be far higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw On day 20 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, residents in the capital Kyiv were placed under a 35-hour curfew - but that didn't stop the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic from travelling there by train. The trip was a Polish idea, after the EU warned of potential security risks. The leaders decided to go by trainbecause flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reported. It was not immediately clear when their train would make the return trip to Warsaw. Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki said history was being made in Ukraine's capital. ""It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,"" he tweeted. Mr Morawiecki added that Ukraine could count on the help of its friends. The prime ministers sat down for a briefing with their Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmyhal, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked them for the ""powerful"" gesture of support. They were accompanied to Ukraine by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. Russian artillery and warplanes are continuing to pound cities and towns across Ukraine. In Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east,hundreds of people crammed into the basement of a large public buildingare running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help, the BBC's Hugo Bachega was told. ""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but is in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious."" Her friends are with other families who spend most of their day in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for sunlight, but rarely outside. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing. A satellite image shows fires burning following Russian strikes in residential area of eastern Mariupol, Ukraine At an intensive care hospital on the western outskirts of the city, staff described being treated like hostages by Russian forces. One employee was quoted as saying that Russian troops had ""forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital,"" adding: ""We can't leave."" The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the facility had been all but destroyed by shelling in recent days, but that staff had continued to treat patients in the basement. Separately, about 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route, according to city authorities. Before the war around 400,000 people lived in the city, which has endured intense bombardment by Russian forces. The city council says well over 2,000 civilians have died. A cameraman and a journalist working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, staff at the US network said. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski (left) and journalist Oleksandra Kuvshinova (seen here wearing a helmet and protective vest) Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott describedthe deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24,as ""heart-breaking"". Their colleague, 39-year-old Benjamin Hall, was also wounded in the incident and taken to hospital. The attack followed the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin. The Russian journalist who protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and shared a video describing the invasion as a crime was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£214; $280) and released. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel One, was detainedon Monday after she ran onto the set holding a sign saying ""no war"". But concerns were later raised over her safety after reports that she could not be contacted. On Tuesday, however, she appeared at a court hearing. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters afterwards that she had gone two days with no sleep, had been questioned for over 14 hours, and was not given access to legal help. Fears that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might lose his lift back to Earth on board a Russian capsule were thankfully put to bed whenit was confirmed he would indeed be making the trip home. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei has spent 355 days in space - a new US record The American, and two other Russian cosmonauts, will be brought back, landing in Kazakhstan. Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager, said: ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that."" Meanwhile, as Western nations impose further sanctions on Russia,Moscow retaliated on Tuesday by slapping sanctions on US President Joe Bidenand 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But there were also a couple of surprises on the list: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son, Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country.

"Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, says Ukraine's railway staff have helped an estimated 2.5 million people to reach safety There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs. The Russians would like to kill him. Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover. ""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me. The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe. So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed. ""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin. When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room. Mr Kamyshin keeps his guards and advisors close There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says. Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west. Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations. ""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says. His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv. Mr Kamyshin is convinced he is a target for Russian forces He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago. Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south. Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west."" It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid. Since Russia's invasion began, thousands of people have been packing train platforms daily to travel to safer locations He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening. ""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West."" My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group. The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked. ""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving. ""We will keep the trains running as long as we can. There is no other option for us.""

"The government has overseen years of decline in cancer care and non-urgent hospital services in England, MPs say. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said services had started deteriorating long before the pandemic. It pointed out key targets had not been met since 2016 and the pandemic had just exacerbated the problems. But ministers said they were investing extra money and creating more capacity to treat patients, to address the backlog that had now developed. NHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clear How the NHS wrestled with worst winter on record A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board.

If you can't see the look-up, click here. More than six million people are currently on a hospital waiting list - one in nine of the population - the highest figure on record. This includes people waiting for operations such as knee and hip replacements. Meanwhile, just two-thirds of urgent cancer patients start treatment within the target time of 62 days. And the number of referrals for cancer care has dropped by between 240,000 and 740,000 since the pandemic started. The MPs said people would face serious health consequences because of delays in cancer treatment, with some dying earlier. The government is also accused of failing to recognise staffing the health service remains its biggest problem. The MPs said the workforce was crippled by shortages and exhausted by two years of the pandemic. Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""The Department for Health and Social Care has overseen a long-term decline that is dragging our NHS and the heroic staff down."" And she was ""extremely concerned"" there was still no real plan to tackle the problems. Last month, the government announced a recovery plan, with an extra Â£8bn being invested over the next three years, which ministers said would see 30% more patients treated. Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations. The Department for Health and Social Care defended its record, saying it had been investing extra money into services throughout the period and the new plan would have a real impact on waits.

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack. The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded. ""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fialawrote in a tweet,external. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."" ""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group. The European leaders held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawieckitweeted,externalthat Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said. The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said. Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"". However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily. ""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"". As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city. The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place. All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine. ""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met the European leaders in Kyiv The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports. Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called Russia's attack on Ukraine ""an act of great evil"" The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion. The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant. The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision. TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment. In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers. Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped Â£20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country. In a statement to The Times,,externalthe church said it made the move ""in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments"". The Church Commissioners manage a Â£9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth Â£3.7bn. In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's ""horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil"". The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia. Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show. Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

"This video can not be played ""I can communicate with someone just like me."" The mother of a boy born without hearing in one ear has criticised delays to Northern Ireland's sign language bill. The parties agreed two years ago tolegally recognise British and Irish sign language through new legislation,external. But the bill will not be able to be passed at Stormont without a functioning executive. Gillian Douglas-Rea said politicians were ""doing a disservice to the whole deaf community"". ""This is about recognising their culture and identity,"" she said. Ms Douglas-Rea's son, Jensen, was also born non-verbal, so she decided to take up sign language but initially found it difficult to access support and ended up paying to take classes online. Gillian Douglas-Rea had to find resources herself in case her son Jensen's hearing deteriorated in the future ""We had to seek out charities and places and at the beginning of our journey, we didn't know what to do,"" she said. She said she was glad she had persevered as it had given her son the ""tools"" he needed in case Jensen's hearing deteriorated in the future. But she would like to see a sign language act in place as soon as possible. ""Our politicians need to get moving,"" she added. Schoolboy teaching sign language to classmates during lockdown Plans to introduce a sign language bill for Northern Ireland are facing a delaywithout a functioning Stormont executive, according to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey. The Sinn FÃ©in minister said her officials had been developing the bill for some time, but executive approval would be needed. Without it, Northern Ireland could become the only part of the UK without such laws. Deirdre Hargey says plans to introduce a sign language bill are facing a delay without a functioning executive A sign language act would require the government to ensure the use of British and Irish sign language across public services. It would also ensure a duty to promote sign language in educational settings and allow more people to learn it for free. Scotland has had laws in place since 2015 recognising sign language, and theRepublic of Ireland followed suit in 2017,external. Later this week, Westminster will debate plans tochange the laws in England and Wales, but it will not apply in Northern Ireland. TheNew Decade New Approach,externaldeal said the parties were committed to bringing forward a bill for British and Irish sign language ""at an early stage"". Asked why Ms Hargey had not already introduced the legislation, as it falls within her remit, she said she wanted to ensure it was as ""comprehensive"" as it could be. ""We're working with the deaf community to ensure it meets all their needs,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I could have rushed this through but, coming from those conversations, we needed to take the additional time. Jensen signing with his mum, Gillian Douglas-Rea ""All new legislation needs to go through the executive, the policy work is continuing to be done. ""Let's hope after the election, we get the executive up and running again so that the legislation can come through."" The British Deaf Association estimates that about 18,000 people in Northern Ireland use British or Irish sign language. The Department for Communities said it had committed Â£1.2m to the British or Irish sign language community since the onset of the pandemic until the end of this financial year. It is also working with members of the British Deaf Association to co-design proposals and develop the sign language bill. Rose Ayling-Ellis calls for sign language law.

"Mask-wearing at Heathrow Airport has moved from being a rule to a recommendation The UK's largest airport has dropped mandatory face masks for passengers. Heathrow Airport no longer requires people to wear them in its terminals, railway stations or office buildings but will continue to recommend they do so. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the latest airlines to relax their policies on face coverings. Passengers must still wear them on board flights if the country they're travelling to requires it. 'Plan B' measures ended in late January, meaning masks were no longer legally required on some public transport and in shops. However Heathrow, which handles a large number of international flights, had kept the rule that face coverings must be worn, until this week. Heathrow's chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said the airport was pleased to move away from mandatory face mask requirements. She said: ""While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we've made in Covid-secure measures - some of which aren't always visible - combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while travelling."" Heathrow said that if there was a significant rise in infections or a future variant of concern, it would not hesitate to bring the mandate back. The airport said face coverings would remain available for people who still want to wear them. All UK Covid travel rules to end Scotland's mask rules will stay in force until April What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? Virgin Atlantic said it was also changing its face mask policy from Wednesday, making it a personal choice for customers and crew to wear them on board. This will only happen on services where international regulations on mask-wearing do not apply. For now, that means flights between Heathrow and Manchester and destinations in the Caribbean such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua. The airline said customers may be asked to wear a mask when getting on and off planes and at destination airports. It highlighted that on routes to or from the US, masks would still be required until at least 18 April. Virgin Atlantic's chief customer and operating officer, Corneel Koster, said its policy would be introduced gradually. He encouraged passengers to respect each other's choices. From Wednesday, British Airways (BA) customers will only have to wear a face covering on board flights if the destination they're travelling to requires it. BA's chief operating officer, Jason Mahoney, said the move was ""welcome"" and ""a positive step forward"". Earlier this month, the airline and tour operator Jet2 relaxed its rules on face coverings for flights to and from England and Northern Ireland. Since Friday, Tui has done the same. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he would like to see the end of mandatory face masks by April or May. He added that cabin crew were being consulted. The aviation industry is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will lift the curtain on a busy summer, after two years of major disruption due to the pandemic. From Friday, all travellers will be able to enter the UK without filling in a passenger locator form or taking Covid tests. Holidaymakers will still need to be aware of, and follow, and rules where they're going. On Friday Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the recovery of aviation ""remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". The airport's passenger numbers last month were still nearly 50% down on pre-pandemic levels. However the airport is recruiting 12,000 staff to try and cope with demand during the summer peak.

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies. Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. Markah watches in tears. ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes. Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional. The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C. In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. Walid is given oxygen At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital. He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted. Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" Naseebullah with his sister Farzana In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says. ""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry."" Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families. Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die. In many of the areas we visited, malnutrition deaths might not even get recorded or counted. The world might never know the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan.

Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme The US says it has warned Russia of ""consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"". Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone on Wednesday with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, General Nikolay Patrushev. The White House said it had requested the call, its highest-level diplomatic engagement with Moscow since a February call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Both countries have accused the other of housing and preparing to use biological weapons inside Ukraine. General Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him since the 1970s. Here's more on the general and other members of Putin's inner circle. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has left the Bolshoi Ballet, Russia's internationally renowned company, after saying she is ""against war with all the fibres of my soul"". She joins the Dutch National Ballet, which describes her as one of the Bolshoi's leading stars, and that it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue working in Russia after she condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, she said on Telegram: ""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after. ""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes."" You can read more about Smirnova's move here. The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest update on Russia's military, saying that it has probably had to resort to using older and less precise weapons, which are more likely to result in civilian casualties. It adds that Russia probably resorted to using these weapons as a result of failing to achieve its military objectives. So far the UN has confirmed the deaths of 729 civilians in Ukraine, though the actual number is expected to be far higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand
Vasiliy Lomachenko. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack. The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded. ""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fialawrote in a tweet,external. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."" ""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group. The European leaders held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawieckitweeted,externalthat Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said. The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said. Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"". However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily. ""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"". As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city. The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place. All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine. ""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met the European leaders in Kyiv The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports. Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one of the few western leaders to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine. He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"". But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy. PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial? But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships. In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman. When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"". Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a Â£1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"". The prime minister inspected a guard of honour after arriving at Abu Dhabi airport Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody. He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers. Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups. Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies. One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties. The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy. But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi. Saudis execute 81 men in one day US softens towards Saudis after murder snub He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"". He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said. ""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful."" Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years. That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy. But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"". With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options. Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored. Read more from Laura here. The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"". ""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borckâ, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says. ""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC. He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer says that âgoing cap-in-hand from dictator to dictatorâ is not an energy policy. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day. The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow. Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"". The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congressby video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's.

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies. Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. Markah watches in tears. ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes. Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional. The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C. In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. Walid is given oxygen At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital. He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted. Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" Naseebullah with his sister Farzana In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says. ""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry."" Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families. Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die. In many of the areas we visited, malnutrition deaths might not even get recorded or counted. The world might never know the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called Russia's attack on Ukraine ""an act of great evil"" The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion. The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant. The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision. TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment. In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers. Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped Â£20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country. In a statement to The Times,,externalthe church said it made the move ""in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments"". The Church Commissioners manage a Â£9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth Â£3.7bn. In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's ""horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil"". The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia. Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show. Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

"Mask-wearing at Heathrow Airport has moved from being a rule to a recommendation The UK's largest airport has dropped mandatory face masks for passengers. Heathrow Airport no longer requires people to wear them in its terminals, railway stations or office buildings but will continue to recommend they do so. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the latest airlines to relax their policies on face coverings. Passengers must still wear them on board flights if the country they're travelling to requires it. 'Plan B' measures ended in late January, meaning masks were no longer legally required on some public transport and in shops. However Heathrow, which handles a large number of international flights, had kept the rule that face coverings must be worn, until this week. Heathrow's chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said the airport was pleased to move away from mandatory face mask requirements. She said: ""While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we've made in Covid-secure measures - some of which aren't always visible - combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while travelling."" Heathrow said that if there was a significant rise in infections or a future variant of concern, it would not hesitate to bring the mandate back. The airport said face coverings would remain available for people who still want to wear them. All UK Covid travel rules to end Scotland's mask rules will stay in force until April What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? Virgin Atlantic said it was also changing its face mask policy from Wednesday, making it a personal choice for customers and crew to wear them on board. This will only happen on services where international regulations on mask-wearing do not apply. For now, that means flights between Heathrow and Manchester and destinations in the Caribbean such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua. The airline said customers may be asked to wear a mask when getting on and off planes and at destination airports. It highlighted that on routes to or from the US, masks would still be required until at least 18 April. Virgin Atlantic's chief customer and operating officer, Corneel Koster, said its policy would be introduced gradually. He encouraged passengers to respect each other's choices. From Wednesday, British Airways (BA) customers will only have to wear a face covering on board flights if the destination they're travelling to requires it. BA's chief operating officer, Jason Mahoney, said the move was ""welcome"" and ""a positive step forward"". Earlier this month, the airline and tour operator Jet2 relaxed its rules on face coverings for flights to and from England and Northern Ireland. Since Friday, Tui has done the same. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he would like to see the end of mandatory face masks by April or May. He added that cabin crew were being consulted. The aviation industry is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will lift the curtain on a busy summer, after two years of major disruption due to the pandemic. From Friday, all travellers will be able to enter the UK without filling in a passenger locator form or taking Covid tests. Holidaymakers will still need to be aware of, and follow, and rules where they're going. On Friday Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the recovery of aviation ""remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". The airport's passenger numbers last month were still nearly 50% down on pre-pandemic levels. However the airport is recruiting 12,000 staff to try and cope with demand during the summer peak.

Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme The US says it has warned Russia of ""consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"". Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone on Wednesday with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, General Nikolay Patrushev. The White House said it had requested the call, its highest-level diplomatic engagement with Moscow since a February call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Both countries have accused the other of housing and preparing to use biological weapons inside Ukraine. General Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him since the 1970s. Here's more on the general and other members of Putin's inner circle. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has left the Bolshoi Ballet, Russia's internationally renowned company, after saying she is ""against war with all the fibres of my soul"". She joins the Dutch National Ballet, which describes her as one of the Bolshoi's leading stars, and that it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue working in Russia after she condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, she said on Telegram: ""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after. ""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes."" You can read more about Smirnova's move here. The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest update on Russia's military, saying that it has probably had to resort to using older and less precise weapons, which are more likely to result in civilian casualties. It adds that Russia probably resorted to using these weapons as a result of failing to achieve its military objectives. So far the UN has confirmed the deaths of 729 civilians in Ukraine, though the actual number is expected to be far higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".

Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme The US says it has warned Russia of ""consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"". Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone on Wednesday with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, General Nikolay Patrushev. The White House said it had requested the call, its highest-level diplomatic engagement with Moscow since a February call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Both countries have accused the other of housing and preparing to use biological weapons inside Ukraine. General Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him since the 1970s. Here's more on the general and other members of Putin's inner circle. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has left the Bolshoi Ballet, Russia's internationally renowned company, after saying she is ""against war with all the fibres of my soul"". She joins the Dutch National Ballet, which describes her as one of the Bolshoi's leading stars, and that it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue working in Russia after she condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, she said on Telegram: ""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after. ""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes."" You can read more about Smirnova's move here. The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest update on Russia's military, saying that it has probably had to resort to using older and less precise weapons, which are more likely to result in civilian casualties. It adds that Russia probably resorted to using these weapons as a result of failing to achieve its military objectives. So far the UN has confirmed the deaths of 729 civilians in Ukraine, though the actual number is expected to be far higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack. The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded. ""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fialawrote in a tweet,external. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."" ""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group. The European leaders held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawieckitweeted,externalthat Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said. The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said. Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"". However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily. ""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"". As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city. The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place. All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine. ""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met the European leaders in Kyiv The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports. Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one of the few western leaders to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine. He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"". But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy. PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial? But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships. In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman. When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"". Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a Â£1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"". The prime minister inspected a guard of honour after arriving at Abu Dhabi airport Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody. He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers. Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups. Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies. One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties. The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy. But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi. Saudis execute 81 men in one day US softens towards Saudis after murder snub He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"". He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said. ""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful."" Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years. That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy. But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"". With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options. Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored. Read more from Laura here. The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"". ""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borckâ, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says. ""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC. He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer says that âgoing cap-in-hand from dictator to dictatorâ is not an energy policy. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day. The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow. Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"". The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congressby video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's.

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia.

"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies. Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. Markah watches in tears. ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes. Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional. The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C. In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. Walid is given oxygen At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital. He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted. Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" Naseebullah with his sister Farzana In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says. ""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry."" Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families. Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die. In many of the areas we visited, malnutrition deaths might not even get recorded or counted. The world might never know the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called Russia's attack on Ukraine ""an act of great evil"" The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion. The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant. The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision. TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment. In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers. Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped Â£20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country. In a statement to The Times,,externalthe church said it made the move ""in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments"". The Church Commissioners manage a Â£9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth Â£3.7bn. In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's ""horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil"". The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia. Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show. Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

"Mask-wearing at Heathrow Airport has moved from being a rule to a recommendation The UK's largest airport has dropped mandatory face masks for passengers. Heathrow Airport no longer requires people to wear them in its terminals, railway stations or office buildings but will continue to recommend they do so. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the latest airlines to relax their policies on face coverings. Passengers must still wear them on board flights if the country they're travelling to requires it. 'Plan B' measures ended in late January, meaning masks were no longer legally required on some public transport and in shops. However Heathrow, which handles a large number of international flights, had kept the rule that face coverings must be worn, until this week. Heathrow's chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said the airport was pleased to move away from mandatory face mask requirements. She said: ""While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we've made in Covid-secure measures - some of which aren't always visible - combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while travelling."" Heathrow said that if there was a significant rise in infections or a future variant of concern, it would not hesitate to bring the mandate back. The airport said face coverings would remain available for people who still want to wear them. All UK Covid travel rules to end Scotland's mask rules will stay in force until April What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? Virgin Atlantic said it was also changing its face mask policy from Wednesday, making it a personal choice for customers and crew to wear them on board. This will only happen on services where international regulations on mask-wearing do not apply. For now, that means flights between Heathrow and Manchester and destinations in the Caribbean such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua. The airline said customers may be asked to wear a mask when getting on and off planes and at destination airports. It highlighted that on routes to or from the US, masks would still be required until at least 18 April. Virgin Atlantic's chief customer and operating officer, Corneel Koster, said its policy would be introduced gradually. He encouraged passengers to respect each other's choices. From Wednesday, British Airways (BA) customers will only have to wear a face covering on board flights if the destination they're travelling to requires it. BA's chief operating officer, Jason Mahoney, said the move was ""welcome"" and ""a positive step forward"". Earlier this month, the airline and tour operator Jet2 relaxed its rules on face coverings for flights to and from England and Northern Ireland. Since Friday, Tui has done the same. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he would like to see the end of mandatory face masks by April or May. He added that cabin crew were being consulted. The aviation industry is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will lift the curtain on a busy summer, after two years of major disruption due to the pandemic. From Friday, all travellers will be able to enter the UK without filling in a passenger locator form or taking Covid tests. Holidaymakers will still need to be aware of, and follow, and rules where they're going. On Friday Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the recovery of aviation ""remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". The airport's passenger numbers last month were still nearly 50% down on pre-pandemic levels. However the airport is recruiting 12,000 staff to try and cope with demand during the summer peak.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one of the few western leaders to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine. He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"". But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy. PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial? But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships. In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman. When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"". Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a Â£1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"". The prime minister inspected a guard of honour after arriving at Abu Dhabi airport Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody. He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers. Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups. Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies. One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties. The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy. But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi. Saudis execute 81 men in one day US softens towards Saudis after murder snub He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"". He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said. ""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful."" Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years. That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy. But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"". With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options. Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored. Read more from Laura here. The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"". ""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borckâ, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says. ""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC. He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer says that âgoing cap-in-hand from dictator to dictatorâ is not an energy policy. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day. The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow. Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"". The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congressby video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's.

"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions. Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow M&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

"Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said he's ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory, raising the fear he might use a small, or ""tactical"" nuclear weapon in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden has warned him that doing so would be the most serious military escalation since World War II. Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. They are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout. The smallest tactical nuclear weapons can be one kiloton or less (producing the equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT). The largest ones can be as big as 100 kilotons. Strategic nuclear weapons are larger (up to 1,000 kilotons) and are launched from longer range. By comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons. According to US intelligence, Russia has aboutabout 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons,external. Its tactical nuclear warheads can be placed on various types of missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives, such as cruise missiles and artillery shells. Tactical nuclear weapons can also be fired from aircraft and ships - as anti-ship missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. The US says Russia has recently been investing heavily in these weapons to improve their range and accuracy. How many nuclear weapons does Russia have? What are the nuclear risks? Tactical nuclear weapons have never been used in conflict. Nuclear powers such as the US and Russia have found it equally effective to destroy targets on the battlefield by using modern conventional munitions. In addition, no nuclear-armed country has so far been willing to risk unleashing all-out nuclear war by employing tactical nuclear weapons. However, Russia might be more willing to use smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles. ""They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold,"" says Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the Chatham House think tank. ""They could see it as part of their conventional forces."" Russian forces can fire small nuclear warheads using conventional artillery, such as the ""Malka"" self-propelled gun In February 2022, shortly before invading Ukraine, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces at ""special combat readiness"" and held high-profile nuclear drills. More recently, he said: ""If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will without a doubt use all available means to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff."" Russia is planning to annex the regions of southern and eastern Ukraine it has occupied after holding self-styled referendums. President Putin says he is ready to defend the ""territorial integrity"" of the regions ""by all means."" US intelligence see this as a threat to the West not to help Ukraine try and retake these territories, rather than as a sign that he is planning a nuclear war. But others worry that Russia, if it suffers further setbacks, might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine as a ""game changer"", to break a stalemate or avoid defeat. James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pace in Washington DC, says: ""I am legitimately worried that in that circumstance, Putin might use a nuclear weapon - most likely on the ground in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way. We are not at that point yet."" US President Joe Bidenhas warned Russia not to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. Speaking during an interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said such action would ""change the face of war unlike anything since World War Two,"" adding: ""It'll be consequential."" How the US and Nato would respond to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want to draw a line. However, Russia might also be deterred from using tactical nuclear weapons by another power - China. ""Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese support,"" says Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings College London. ""But China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. ""If he used them, he would probably lose China.""
