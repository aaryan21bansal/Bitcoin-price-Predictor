"The outer bands of Irma have already reached Miami Florida's state governor has told residents who were ordered to leave their homes to go to shelters and avoid the roads as Hurricane Irma approaches. Rick Scott said it was now too late to drive away from the danger areas. After devastating several Caribbean islands, Irma is lashing Cuba with strong winds and heavy rain, and is due to reach Florida on Sunday. Some 6.3 million people, more than 25% of the US state's population, have been ordered to evacuate. The hurricane made landfall on the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago, in Cuba's north-east, late on Friday as a category five storm but has now weakened to a category three. After moving slowly along the northern Cuban coast it is now heading out to sea towards Florida. Irma is expected to strengthen once it moves away from Cuba, and will remain a powerful hurricane as it approaches Florida,the National Hurricane Center says in its latest advisory at 00:00 GMT.,external It says Irma has maximum sustained winds of 120mph (193km/h). It was the first category five hurricane to hit Cuba in more than 80 years, and it is expected to strengthen again before reaching Florida. At least 24 people are so far known to have died as Hurricane Irma progressed across the Caribbean throughout the week. Irma is expected to hit the coast at around lunchtime on Sunday, but the outer bands are already affecting the south of the state and central Miami is being lashed by heavy rain. The Florida Keys - a chain of small islands to the south - have suffered some minor damage and are expected to bear the brunt of the storm on Sunday morning. The head of emergencies agency Fema, Brock Long, told CNN there were ""no safe areas within the Keys"". ""You put your life in your own hands by not evacuating,"" he added. Staying behind is 'almost like suicide' 'I have never been so scared in my life' The deadly danger from Miami's cranes Hurricane Irma: A visual guide ""If you're in an evacuation zone, you've got to get to a shelter need to get to a shelter... there's not many hours left"", Gov Scott warned residents. ""The winds are coming, there is not gonna be a lot of time now to be able to drive very far."" Thousands of people on the mainland are currently without electricity, energy provider Florida Power and Light reported. The western Gulf coast is expected to be worst affected, with cities such as Tampa and St Petersburg in the path of the storm. The Tampa Bay area, with a population of about three million, has not been hit by a major hurricane since 1921.

Waves crashed over Havana's sea wall as Irma approached The state weather service has forecast waves up to 9m high in some coastal areas. There have been reports of huge waves breaking over sea walls, particularly in the fishing village of Caibarien.

It is following a similar path to Irma and already hampering relief efforts in some of the worst affected areas. Residents of Barbuda, where 95% of buildings have been destroyed by Irma, left the island as Jose approached but it is no longer expected to hit. However, hurricane warnings are in place for St Martin and St Barthelemy, both also hit by Irma. Hurricane Katia, in the Gulf of Mexico, a category one storm with winds of up to 75mph, made landfall on the Mexican Gulf coast in the state of Veracruz late on Friday.

"Officials have warned that no areas of the low-lying Florida Keys will be safe Concern is growing for residents in the most vulnerable areas of Florida who have not yet evacuated, as Hurricane Irma edges closer to making landfall. Despite authorities begging residents of the Florida Keys to evacuate since Thursday, some have opted to remain. The low-lying coral cay islands are scattered off Florida's southern coast, with a population of 70,000. One official warned staying on the islands among storm surge warnings was ""almost like suicide"". The tropical archipelago extends for more than 100 miles off the US mainland, north of Cuba. The islands, which are mostly part of Monroe County, are linked to the Florida peninsula by a scenic highway that runs across into Miami. In 2005 the islands avoided a direct hit from Hurricane Wilma, but the category three storm caused major ocean storm surges that left low-lying areas inundated with flood water.

Much of the Keys have an elevation of just a few feet above sea level. Key West, the largest island with a population of about 27,000, is extremely vulnerable to the large storm surges forecast by Hurricane Irma (though it has one of the highest points in the Keys at 18ft (5.5m) above sea level).

"The tomb belonged to a man named Amenemhat Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered the tomb of a royal goldsmith containing the mummies of a woman and her two children, authorities said. The tomb, dating back to the New Kingdom (16th to 11th Centuries BC), was found near the Nile city of Luxor, 400 miles (700km) south of Cairo. Among the items discovered inside was a statue of the goldsmith Amenemhat, sitting beside his wife. It is unclear whether the three mummies discovered are connected to Amenemhat. The mummies were found down a burial shaft leading off the main chamber, Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities said. The tomb was found in the Draa Abul Naga necropolis, which was used for officials According to the archaeologists, the mother died aged about 50, with tests revealing she had a bacterial bone disease. Her two sons were in their 20s and 30s and their bodies said to have been preserved in good condition. Authorities believe the tomb of Amenemhat, who was goldsmith for the god Amun, the period'smost powerful deity, could lead them to further discoveries in the Draa Abul Naga necropolis, an area famed for its temples and burial grounds. Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anani said: ""We found many objects of the funerary equipment inside and outside the tomb. We found mummies, coffins, funerary combs, funerary masks, some jewellery, and statue. ""The work did not finish yet."" The bodies of the male mummies are said to be in good condition Mr Anani said archaeologists had read four new names. ""What about those four new names? How about their tombs? Their tombs are not discovered yet. But I believe they are owners of the tomb,"" he said. ""I believe, inshallah, for the coming season, we are going to do our excavations. We are going to do our excavations in this area. So I believe we can find one, or two or maybe four if we are going to be very lucky, four of them in this area.""

"Thousands of protesters in favour of the UK staying in the European Union have marched in Westminster. The People's March for Europe took a route through central London before a rally in Parliament Square. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said there were a growing number of people worried about Brexit's impact. The march came ahead ofMPs voting on Mondayon a bill that will overturn the act that took the UK into the EU and end the supremacy of EU law in the UK. Remainers - many dressed in blue and yellow outfits and draped in EU flags - amassed outside Parliament on Saturday afternoon. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Many carried ""Exit from Brexit"" placards or wore ""Remoaner Till I Die"" t-shirts. Former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey told marchers he had ""gone from anger to distress, from fury to despair"". He added: ""Since the Brexit negotiations begun there's a third emotion I've been feeling - embarrassment. ""Embarrassment at our country's leaders. Embarrassment for Great Britain."" Tory peer Baroness Patience Wheatcroft told demonstrators that Remainers needed to keep campaigning to stay in the EU. She said: ""We have to stop Brexit. Since we joined the EU we've had an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. It must be right to try and maintain that. ""It's not undemocratic to try to persuade the electorate to think again about Brexit. That's democracy at work."" Organisers estimated there were between 10,000 and 15,000 people at the start of the march, adding that numbers rose to about 50,000 at its height as people joined along the way. The police did not provide any estimates and the BBC is unable to verify these figures. Brexit: Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' Reality Check: Brexit catch-up One marcher, wearing a blue beret emblazoned with yellow stars, told the BBC she had joined the rally because she felt ""totally violated by the idea of Brexiting"". ""I've lived, worked and loved in Europe for years. My whole existence has been a European existence,"" she said. ""My husband has a business in Europe. We worked for years to build this up. What's going to happen to that?"" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable was at the march One man, holding a home-made placard, said. ""I don't believe people really knew what they were voting for. ""We keep being told those who voted to Remain have largely changed their minds but I don't believe that at all."" Sir Vince told the BBC growing numbers of people wanted the UK to keep its links with the European Union and this was the beginning of a ""loud and powerful"" movement. ""They (the government) are not listening - they've got tin ear,"" he said. ""They're making a complete mess of these negotiations - totally disunited, dysfunctional, a lack of preparation. ""Even if you believe in Brexit you must be in despair at the way they're approaching these negotiations.""

"The Sunday Telegraph,externalreports that Theresa May will attempt to win back young voters lost to Jeremy Corbyn in the general election, by looking at cutting interest rates on student loans and ""strong-arming"" universities into lowering tuition fees. It predicts that announcements could follow within weeks - at next month's Conservative party conference and in the autumn Budget. According to the paper, the Treasury has grown infuriated that, in its view, some students are being ""ripped off"" by taking courses costing Â£9,000 a year which offer little in return. However, some senior Tories are said to have told the Telegraph that the party must not ""over-interpret the results of a disastrous campaign"" by adopting ""hardcore Corbynism"". The Sunday Times,externaldescribes Tony Blair's call for tough new rules on immigration - in contrast to the open borders he presided over as prime minister - as an ""explosive"" intervention in the Brexit debate. In an article for the paper's website,,externalMr Blair acknowledges that this is a radical departure from his policies in office. But he argues that ""back then, the economy was strong, the workers needed"" and ""the times were different"" and voters' concerns now ""cannot be ignored"". In an editorial, the Sunday Times calls this a""deathbed repentance"",externalon migration, and a ""mea culpa"" for the decision of the Labour government to open the door to people from the EU's new eastern European members. Would Britain have voted for Brexit, it asks, or even held a referendum without the pressures this unleashed? Its conclusion: Tony Blair's conversion has come too late. The Observer,externalreports that survivors on Caribbean islands shattered by Hurricane Irma are begging the world for food, water, shelter and rescue as they face down armed looters and the prospect of a fresh onslaught from Hurricane Jose. There is also no let up in the criticism of the UK government's response to Hurricane Irma. The Sunday Telegraph condemns it as ""appallingly slow"" and a ""dereliction of duty"". As well as the Americans, it says, the French and the Dutch have been far more dynamic. Writing in the Mail, the former attorney general in Anguilla, Rupert Jones, says the British overseas territory has been devastated - and what's been promised so far is a ""drop in the ocean"". If Irma had hit the Falklands or Gibraltar, there would have been a national outcry, he complains. A British Royal Logistics Corps Mexflote arrives in Anguilla to help with the relief effort Writing in the Sun on Sunday, the International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, says the critics are ""just wrong"". She says the Â£32 million already pledged will support the humanitarian needs of people left without food, water, shelter and power, while ministers are also looking at how to rebuild islands. Ms Patel adds that a Royal Navy vessel loaded with aid and military support was deployed ahead of the disaster, and that UK forces are working around the clock in the British Virgin Islands. The Sunday Express,externalandthe Daily Star Sunday,externalboth focus on what they call the ""miraculous"" escape of a British family trapped by Irma in their house of the Caribbean island of Tortola. At one stage, parents Sasha and Brendan Joyce say they had to lay on top of their two boys, aged four and two, to prevent them being blown away. The bedroom they were in was the only room not destroyed.

It quotes the Church of England vicar, Richard Coles, as revealing that discussions have taken place - though the Corporation is said to have ruled it out for the current series.

"Calman said her wife would be at the Strictly studio to see her dance Susan Calman has strongly defended her decision as an openly gay woman to dance with a male professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing. The Scottish comedian and writer has faced criticism on social media for taking part in the show - because it does not have same-sex dancing couples. Calman said the criticism had offended her, adding: ""No one can say I haven't stood up for my community."" It is understood show bosses have not ruled out same-sex couples in future. Calman is one of 15 celebrities taking to the dance floor on the BBC One contest. The stars will find out who their professional partners are in the launch show, broadcast on Saturday night. The 42-year-old said she was ""absolutely not disappointed"" that she would not be paired with a woman and that it was her decision to dance with a man. She said: ""I think politically, there's nothing more powerful than having an openly gay woman on the biggest show on television, whose wife's on the front row, doing what she wants to do."" Meet the stars of Strictly 2017 Calman has also written a book about depression, called Cheer Up Love She added: ""For the gay community to criticise me and try to get me what they want to do is, I think, as difficult as suggesting the straight community are trying to. ""No one is holding me hostage in this room, making me wear a dress and dance with a man. I want to learn how to dance."" Calman suggested she was receiving more flack as a gay woman than gay male contestants had done on the dance show - including The Reverend Richard Coles, a fellow member of the ""class of 2017"". ""I have protested, I have picketed, I have fought, I have been spat on, I have been punched - and I want to dance,"" she said. ""There will be a time for same-sex dancing. I think what annoyed me slightly is that I seem to be getting it in the neck. ""Will Young didn't get it, Judge Rinder didn't get it, Richard Coles isn't getting it. It seems to me as a woman, he's not getting it the same way I am. ""And for me to be getting it is, I think, unfair. I seem to be getting the brunt of the LGBT community."" Richard Coles is the first vicar to take part in the show Coles, meanwhile, said he would be more than happy to dance with a male partner. He said: ""We've had a discussion about it actually, and I don't know. I mean, it's in no sense that anyone resists the idea in principle, it's just a question of doing it. ""I think it's a good year to do it actually, with the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Decriminalisation Act."" Calman, who presents daytime quiz The Boss and children's programme Top Class, said the issue had become ""a bigger deal than it should have"". ""To put the weight of the LGBT community on me - and changing platforms and changing perceptions - is unfair, upsetting and is ignoring the impact I will have in the biggest show on television. ""A lot of people are very supportive of my decision, but it's making this about my sexuality instead of a woman wanting to learn how to dance. ""The idea that people are depressed by it or upset by it, I think offends me because I've done... a lot for that community."" The 15 contenders for the Strictly glitterball trophy Calman, who regularly appears on TV and radio panel shows, has also spoken about the issue on social media. She received support from fans with one saying, tongue in cheek: ""You're not a straight man, so must ALWAYS represent your sex/sexual orientation/short stature!""

"Kay said the last four months had been ""horrendous"" for Manchester Comedian Peter Kay has delivered a message of defiance at Manchester Arena's reopening concert, declaring ""we can't let terrorists win"". Kay appeared at the We Are Manchester show on Saturday alongside other local heroes including Noel Gallagher. More than 14,000 fans were there, four months after a bomb killed 22 people. ""The victims will never ever be forgotten, but we've got to move forward with love and not hate, and that's how we win,"" Kay told the crowd. Kay worked as a steward at the venue in the 1990s before going on to perform there more than 40 times. Noel Gallagher appeared to shed a tear ""There's been a lot of joy in this room over the years, including the night of 22 May, right up until the terrorist attack,"" he said - and the crowd booed at the mention of the attack. ""These last four months have been incredibly painful,"" Kay continued. ""Horrendous is putting it mildly. But that's why you're here - because we can't let terrorists win. ""And I know the memories of that night will stay with us for a very long time but we've got to remember the good times and let them outweigh the bad."" Kay then introduced Gallagher, and the former Oasis star performed a string of favourites including Don't Look Back In Anger. The song took on special significance in the wake of the bombing aftera crowd started spontaneously singing it at a memorial. ""It's become some sort of anthem for defiance,"" Gallagher said. ""And every time you sing, we win."" The atmosphere was joyful for most of the show Armed police patrolled outside and inside the arena As well as defiance, the mood at the event had a mixture of pride, catharsis, pure enjoyment - and, for some, trepidation. Among the crowd were Paul Woodhouse and his son, from Edinburgh, who were at the Ariana Grande concert that was attacked on 22 May. He said: ""Some of us that were there first time were there [at the reopening] to face a fear. ""Not so much of going to a concert, but of going back to the same place. It's still a bit raw. In time, yes, I think it will have helped, coming back to the same place."" The atmosphere inside the concert was ""quite positive"", he added. ""We found everybody was quite cheerful with everybody. Quite uplifting. You knew everybody was standing together."" Courteeners got the crowd going Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was in the audience Adrian Thorpe, who was in the arena foyer when the bomb went off, said returning with his daughter and partner was initially ""nerve-wracking"". He said: ""It was emotional returning but it's turned out a happy evening. Last time we were here it was a sad time but it's been a joyous evening. ""She's enjoyed it and that's all that matters now.

"Thomas Cook customers in Cuba have been evacuated to the north resort town of Varadero British tourists in Cuba have been speaking of the impact of Hurricane Irma, with one saying the storm had led to the ""honeymoon from hell"". Irma has made landfall on the island, having claimed at least 20 lives as it churned across the Caribbean. Thomas Cook has been criticised by some for not evacuating tourists, and continuing to bring holidaymakers to Cuba's resorts as late as Thursday. A spokeswoman says the firm is working with Cuban authorities to get customers off the island. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide The areas most at risk Powerful Hurricane Irma strikes Cuba Sam Lever, 50, from Bury in Greater Manchester, travelled to Cuba last week with his new wife Chelsea, 30, for their honeymoon. The couple told the BBC how they, along with 2,500 other Thomas Cook passengers, had to travel eight hours by coach from the resort of Cayo Coco to the town of Varadero. Mr Lever said: ""This is becoming a honeymoon from hell. ""We were all put on 11 buses by the authorities and had to travel eight hours with no food to Varadero. ""There were people on those coaches who had arrived from Manchester the night before. I just find that scandalous behaviour."" Software developer Sam Lever, 50, is currently celebrating his honeymoon in Cuba with his wife Chelsea Mr Lever said a contingent of Canadian tourists in the resort were flown home on Thursday. He said he and his wife were ""huddled into a games room"" with other tourists. ""We just think Thomas Cook was playing a game of roulette, seeing if the storm would even hit Cayo Coco. ""It's scandalous that they flew people out on Wednesday, with staff who were going to deal with the evacuation. ""It's an absolute disgrace."" One of those flown in on Wednesday was Steve Allen, who said there were ""major flaws"" in the evacuation process. ""They actually lost our passenger manifest at the hotel so we didn't know who was meant be going where at the time,"" he said. ""Well, we are now stuck in Varadero and praying we get through this nightmare in one piece."" This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows the central province of Villa Clara battered by wind and rain A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said the company had followed advice given to them by Cuban authorities, and that they were told to evacuate their customers to Varadero. She added that three aircraft would be chartered to Varadero on Sunday to bring UK holidaymakers home. Roy Pinches said his daughter, who works as cabin crew for Thomas Cook, had been sent to Cuba on Thursday and was now stranded on the island. Mr Pinches said: ""They have been told to stay in one room where 10 cabin crew have been told to barricade themselves in ""Their last option is to use the bathroom where they have been told to get under the table placed there. ""This hotel could not be in a worse position to handle this hurricane.""

"This video can not be played Jennifer, Kirsty, Kate and Amie (from left) drink mocktails and an alcohol-free beer Amie used to drink 30 pints in a weekend to ""keep up with the boys"". ""I could neck three bottles of wine and not think about it,"" said the 38-year-old from Derbyshire. Her drinking was so extreme that she contemplated suicide: ""I thought well, stuff's got to change."" For Jennifer, it caused her relationship with her partner to break down: ""I was like a different person when I was drinking - I had blackouts,"" she said. A report last year found women are nowalmost on a parwith men when it comes to problematic drinking. Both Amie and Jennifer had had enough of hangovers - and decided to give up alcohol. They are doing it with the help of one programme designed to help people stop drinking called One Year No Beer, a scheme people pay to join which gives them strategies to help them to go alcohol-free. One tactic is known as stealth drinking, where people pretend their non-alcoholic drink is alcohol, for example by getting a non-alcoholic beer in a pint glass topped up with lemonade. One Year No Beer,externalhas seen a 10-fold increase in membership this year alone. The alcohol-free drinks market is booming too. In only five years, the amount of low or alcohol-free beer sold in the UK has risen by nearly 50%. And the world's first alcohol-free spirit Seedlip launched 21 months ago. In 12 months, it experienced a 1,000% rise in sales. There are nowclubs,externalfor people who want to get together without alcohol and the UK's firstalcohol-free drinking festival,externalwas held in London last month. The alcohol-free drinks market is booming as increasing numbers choose to give up alcohol The clubs and the festival want to cater for theincreasing number of Britonschoosing to give up drink. Areport,externalby the Office for National Statistics in May found that just under 60% of those surveyed had had an alcoholic drink in the past week - the lowest rate since the survey began in 2005. Another survey from 2015,externalfound that one in four British people were thinking of cutting down their drinking or at least trying to reduce it. Still, many who have made the change complain that there are few options in traditional pubs other than sugary soft drinks. Prof Luc Bovens, an expert in public health at London School of Economics, has made a number of recommendations to British pubs aimed at ""nudging"" people away from alcohol. ""The road to hangovers is often paved with good intentions, but by tinkering with the British pub's choice architecture we may be able to help some people,"" hewrote.,external He suggested that pubs provide a no-alcohol or low-alcohol beer on tap and added: ""For many people, there is a distinct feeling of alienation in toasting proper pints with a sad little bottle."" A spokesman for the British Beer & Pub Association said: ""No-alcohol beers are bottled because the sales volume typically wouldn't support a keg option. ""Our members have a good track record. Within the beer category, we've seen brewers remove 1.3 billion units from the market by the drinks industry as part of the Public Health Responsibility Deal, through producing low strength, or no strength options and reducing the strength of existing products."" Jennifer said one of the biggest challenges comes from friends: ""It's actually seen as bad or weird not drinking. It's like you're a minority, people look at you like you're an absolute weirdo."" But after 90 days of not drinking, her relationship with her partner is back on track and her life has improved: ""Getting up on a Monday is not a problem. I can bounce out of bed."" Meanwhile for Amie, who has been alcohol-free for 16 months, the benefits have been vast:  ""I lost four stone. I train six days a week. And everything I want to do, I can go and do.""

"This video can not be played Strictly's professional dancers led the tribute Stars of Strictly Come Dancing have paid an emotional tribute to former co-host Sir Bruce Forsyth at the start of this year's series. Sir Bruce, whodied in Augustaged 89, had a showbiz career that lasted 75 years - 10 of them on Strictly. The tribute started with a collection of Sir Bruce's best moments and people's favourite memories. The professional dancers then performed a traditional ballroom routine to ""Fly Me to the Moon"" by Frank Sinatra. The outline of Sir Bruce's fist-to-face pose was in the background, and the dancers adopted it as a last nod to the entertainer. A tearful Tess Daly, who co-hosted the show alongside Sir Bruce from 2004, said that everyone working on Strictly ""missed him dearly"". She fondly remembered his attempts to steady her nerves before the first show in 2004. Sir Bruce always joined in the dancing with co-host Tess Daly Clips of Sir Bruce insisting various contestants were his ""favourite"" showed his comedic side. The show described him as ""Strictly family"". One of the judges, Bruno Tonioli, said Sir Bruce ""always had time for everyone"", adding ""he'll never be forgotten"". ""That first show, I was sitting in my little dressing room and there was a knock at the door,"" recalled Len Goodman, a previous head judge. ""And he said: 'Len, I just wanted to say, I hope you have a lovely show'. ""And there I am, little old Len, the dance teacher from Dartford, sitting and chatting with Bruce Forsyth."" Strictly was Sir Bruce's final television role, yet he managed to coin a new, enduring catchphrase - always encouraging the audience to ""Keep dancing!"" Obituary: Sir Bruce Forsyth In pictures: Bruce Forsyth fans copy his pose in unusual locations Craig Revel Horwood, another judge, described him simply as an ""inspiration"". Dancer Anton Du Beke said he ""couldn't tell you how that feels"", describing the moment Sir Bruce asked him to choreograph his entrance with Tess Daly. The first show of the new series also saw the celebrity contestants matched with their professional partners. This year's famous faces include singer Alexandra Burke, Good Morning Britain presenter Charlotte Hawkins, and Jonnie Peacock, the Paralympic gold medallist. The long-standing judging panel of Horwood, Darcey Bussell and Tonioli have been joined by a new head judge, following Len Goodman's departure.

The boy was found critically injured inside the Aida Bliss building in Derby, just after 19:30 BST on Friday. He was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Police said he had been at the factory in City Road, Chester Green, with two friends who had been left ""understandably distraught"" by what happened. The building was used to make metal stamping presses, but since closing in 2004 it has attracted people inside to take photos and videos they post online. This photo inside the Aida Bliss factory was taken by photography student Alison White Officers have appealed for potential witnesses to speak to them ""urgently"". They believe there may have been other youngsters inside the factory who were not known to the group. Ch Supt Jim Allen, of Derbyshire Police, said: ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to the young boy's family.

"Fans are facing tight security as they queue for the show Thousands of people are attending a special benefit concert at Manchester Arena for its first event since May's bomb attack that killed 22 people. Noel Gallagher is headlining theWe Are Manchester show, featuring the likes of the Courteeners and poet Tony Walsh. Charlotte Campbell, whose daughter Olivia, 15, died in the attack, said she had come back to show defiance. Suicide bomber Salman Abedidetonated a homemade device in the foyer, following an Ariana Grande concert, on 22 May. Extra security measures were in place for the re-opening with restrictions on the size of bags that could be taken in. Charlotte Campbell's daughter Olivia, 15, was killed in the attack ""We have had to come back to show defiance, to show we are not scared and we don't want Manchester to be scared,"" said Mrs Campbell, from Bury. ""Music was Olivia's life. If she had been still here today she would have been walking through those doors with us, showing her defiance, that they may have got her but she's not beaten. She's here with us."" One family's story of surviving the bomb Who were the victims? Attack survivors visit Manchester Arena Sally Thornton-Heywood said it was an emotional return to the arena For Sally Thornton-Heywood, from Leeds, who attended the Ariana Grande concert with daughter Tilly, 13, said she felt ""very emotional"". ""I just thought about those parents, the children and the fear that set into them,"" she said. ""[For us on the night] It was fight or flight.  Fortunately we were at the other side of the arena, I just had to get out."" By Ian Shoesmith, BBC News As I arrived at the arena with my wife and seven-year-old son, we had to pass through airport-style security checks. The whole process was very quick though - clearly a lot of people heeded advice and turned up early. At least half the foyer area is still sealed off and it is quite unsettling being at the scene of the awful events of 22 May. As they queued fans were pretty quiet, but once they were inside the arena it was far more like a normal gig. Manchester legend Clint Boon was first on DJ-ing and warming up the crowd with Manchester classics. Tony Walsh's This Is The Place poem was cheered enthusiastically before he paused to ask for a moment to remember the victims and all those injured. ""We don't want a minute's silence. This is Manchester and I want everybody to make as much noise as they possibly can,"" he said. Thousands in the arena didn't need a second invitation, clapping wildly and shouting their message loud and clear: This city will never be silenced. Music fans Jennifer Stuart 28, Sophie Chadwick 27 and Liv Slack, 29, all from Altrincham, said they felt safe as they arrived. ""We're here because of what it means to Manchester.

"This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows the central province of Villa Clara battered by wind and rain Hurricane Irma is lashing Cuba with strong winds and heavy rain after devastating several Caribbean islands. The hurricane made landfall on the Camaguey Archipelago, in Cuba's north-east, as a category five storm but has now weakened to a category three. The Bahamas have largely been spared. In Florida, 5.6 million people, or 25% of the US state's population, have been told to leave as the storm approaches. At least 20 people are known to have died so far across the Caribbean. Irma hit the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago late on Friday, threatening nearby coastal towns and villages. It was the first category five hurricane to hit Cuba in decades. It weakened to category three by Saturday lunchtime but is expected to strengthen again as it approaches Florida. This video can not be played WATCH: Hurricane Hunters fly over eye of storm to help forecasters At 12:00 GMT, Irma had maximum sustained winds of 209km/h (130mph), theNational Hurricane Center,externalin the US said. It has brought vast amounts of rainfall to parts of Cuba, with extensive flooding reported in the fishing village of Caibarien. Staying behind is 'almost like suicide' The deadly danger from Miami's cranes Barbuda races to escape second hurricane UK's hurricane response 'found wanting' Power lines have been brought down in several parts of the central province of Camaguey, and communication is becoming increasingly difficult with towns in more remote areas, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana reports. Thousands of people have been evacuated but many others stayed to ride out the storm. Cuban officials reported ""significant damage"", without giving further details, but said there were no confirmed casualties yet, AFP news agency reported. Earlier, people tried to secure their roofs and move belongings from low-lying coastal areas to higher ground. ""There are really strong gusts of wind. It is pouring off and on, and the lights are out,"" Anaida Gonzalez, a retired nurse in the Camaguey province, told Reuters. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide The areas most at risk In pictures: Irma ravages Caribbean About 50,000 tourists are fleeing or have fled Cuba, with resorts on the north coast now empty, the news agency reports.

About 25,000 people are currently without electricity, energy provider Florida Power and Light reported. Florida Governor Rick Scott  issued a stark warning to those in threatened areas on the west coast. ""Look, it's getting late,"" he told NBC. ""If you're not on the road on the west coast by noon [16:00 GMT], you need to get to a shelter, get to a friend's house if you're in an evacuation zone. Get off the road."" He said that storm surges in coastal areas could be as high as 12ft (3.7m), adding that people ""cannot survive this"". Some 50,000 people have gone to shelters throughout the state, the governor said. Media reports say shelters in some areas have been filling up quickly and some people have been turned away.

"Montana Brown, Mark Wright, Vicky Pattison have launched careers after being on reality TV ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" is a common question - especially at the start of the school year. A singer, a doctor, a vet, a firefighter... a reality TV star? Ever since Big Brother launched in the UK in 2000, reality TV has - for the lucky few - been the launch pad for a lucrative career. TV presenters Alison Hammond, Vicky Pattison and Mark Wright are successful celebrities whose careers were launched by reality TV. Nearly half of the housemates in this year's Celebrity Big Brother made their names - and their money - from other reality shows. And this year's Love Island contestants are already cashing in on their status with brand endorsements and nightclub appearances. CBB contestants Jemma Lucy, Sandi Bogle and Sam Thompson have all previously appeared on reality TV shows ""Reality TV has become more of a career choice than being an actor or singer,"" says Edward Hopkins, celebrity publicist for Nusic London. ""Gone are the days where people say you are famous for doing nothing. Reality TV is now seen as a legitimate career."" So how lucrative is a career in reality TV? The most popular contestants can become millionaires. Publicists say the money rolls in from: Brand endorsements: Become the face of a fashion retailer and you can bank Â£150,000 Editorial deals: Give a newspaper or celebrity magazine access to your home, add a few quotes, and earn Â£40,000 Nightclub appearances: Show your face for an hour at a nightclub and earn Â£3,000 to Â£10,000 a pop A book or fitness DVD deal: Earn anything from Â£50,000 to Â£300,000 While most reality TV stars keep their fortunes a secret, several are estimated to be millionaires. Former Towie star Amy Childs is said to have Â£5m in the bank thanks to a book deal, perfume and clothing ranges and a beauty salon in Essex. Gary ""Gaz"" Beadle from Geordie Shore has an estimated Â£1m after investing in a beach club and launching his own fashion line. And - if you can't make it on your own - there's a way of boosting your chances. ""If you leave a show in a relationship there's a lot more chance of making more money,"" says Mr Hopkins. ""I fully believe in the first year a couple can make Â£1m."" Olivia says her phone did not stop ringing after she left Love Island Love Island star Olivia Buckland came second on series two of the show after coupling up with co-star Alex Bowen - to whom she is now engaged. She has forged a successful career working with fashion and beauty brands such as Miss Pap and Cocoa Brown, and has also starred in an episode of the reality TV show Say Yes to the Dress. ""I was expecting to come out and get a job in car sales,"" she says. ""But the minute I came out my phone blew off. I had so many people messaging me about sponsors and working alongside fashion brands. ""Instagram has become such a massive marketing platform and they utilise reality stars."" Sam Faiers (Towie) Joey Essex (Towie) Imogen Thomas (Big Brother) Lucy Mecklenburgh (Towie) Charlotte Crosby (Geordie Shore) Gemma Collins (Towie) Scarlett Moffatt (Gogglebox) Louise Thompson (Made in Chelsea) Josie Gibson (Big Brother) Binky Felstead (Made in Chelsea) Olivia says reality TV stars get approached to advertise many products, but she wanted to ""stay true"" to herself by choosing brands wisely. ""It just grew and grew because women and young girls could see I was honest and I am relatable,"" she says. Even though a newer batch of Love Island stars has recently been unleashed onto the world, Olivia is not concerned about the extra competition. ""Me and Alex have managed to carve a life for ourselves where we don't have to worry about more people coming out. ""As long as you follow your own path you can continue to make money."" Megan McKenna has appeared on at least three different reality TV shows Reality TV has become so lucrative that if at first contestants don't succeed in achieving fame, they try again. Megan McKenna has become famous for Towie, yet also has two stabs at Ex On The Beach and a stint on Celebrity Big Brother to her name. Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings - who worked on shows including Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! - says it's not unusual for contestants to apply for a variety of shows. ""I have people asking me how they get on reality TV, how they can train themselves to be a likely candidate, and how they might present themselves differently. ""The better known stars have been through a number of these shows. ""It's almost like an apprenticeship they serve up through the ranks of various TV shows until they reach the one they really want to be on. ""I see the same people again and again applying for different reality TV shows."" Social media has transformed the prospects of reality TV stars. Big brands no longer have to rely on television adverts, or taking out expensive magazine deals, to access their target audience. Instead they can pay a popular TV contestant to wear their clothes and have direct access to millions of potential customers. This year's Love Island contestants have already been cashing in with Montana Brown teaming up with online fashion retailer PrettyLittleThing and Amber Davies with Motel Rocks. Love Island's Montana Brown poses in a Pretty Little Thing dress in a post on Instagram ""Social media has definitely helped play a part in building careers for reality TV contestants,"" says Andrew Bloch, co-founder of Frank PR and Lord Sugar's publicist. ""The reality TV audience watch people on the show, relate to them and want to follow the story lines on social media to find out what they are up to when the cameras are off. ""This enables the stars of the shows to build large online followings with an engaged fan base, which raises their profiles and in turn increases their worth."" While several stars have become millionaires from a career in reality TV, experts warn it's not an easy task. You need good management - and a bit of good luck. ""The chances of becoming a reality TV star are low, and just appearing on a show is no guarantee of being able to build a viable long term career off the back of it,"" says Mr Bloch. ""For the minority, reality shows can provide a platform for success. However, to aspire to being a reality show contestant as a viable career choice is naive and unrealistic."" But Ms Hemmings believes it won't stop people from trying. ""The fact that 99% of reality TV stars are never heard from again doesn't matter. There is that 1% that have enjoyed success from it. ""Then viewers watch it and see ordinary people showcasing themselves and they think I could do that and they start applying. It feeds itself."" What's the big deal about Love Island?

"Russian television has broadcast a series of glowing reports on everyday life in North Korea ""It smells of freshness, and of our deep respect for our leader,"" the woman declared, smiling to the Russian TV camera. A North Korean, she'd just sniffed a big red flower named after the country's former leader Kim Jong-il. Part of a series of glowing reports on everyday life in the secretive state, covering topics from fashion to food,the moment was broadcast to millions of Russians,externalwatching state television over their breakfast. The coverage suggested Russia was taking a rather different approach over North Korea's nuclear programme and its missile tests, two weeks afterDonald Trump tweeted that the US military was ""locked and loaded"",external, primed to respond with what he called ""military solutions"". North Korea crisis in 300 words How should Trump handle North Korea? How do you defend against North Korea? Vladimir Putin has underlined those differences many times this week, warning against whipping up ""military hysteria"", and insisting that North Koreans would rather ""eat grass"" under more sanctions, than give up their weapons programme. And while he has criticised recent missile tests as ""provocative"", he's also taken pains to explain them. President Putin argues North Korea has developed its nuclear capability in self-defence North Koreans remember the 2003 US invasion of Iraq over Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons programme, Mr Putin reasoned. So the country sees becoming a nuclear state as its only sure-fire guarantee of self-defence. ""Russia believes that Pyongyang's aim is not to bomb anyone, that its [nuclear programme] is a deterrent against South Korea and the US,"" explains Alexander Gabuev of the Moscow Carnegie Centre. ""Russia understands that because it is just as paranoid about American 'democracy promotion' as North Korea is,"" he adds. Putin - pictured with Kim Jong-il in 2002 - wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt Personal experience is perhaps also partly why Russia - under US sanctions itself - opposes imposing further penalties on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear ambitions. The US wants the international community to apply more economic pressure,including a full energy embargo and a ban on hiring North Korean labourers. ""What are we going to do? Stop all energy exports so people freeze and ambulances have no fuel to reach the sick?"" asks Georgy Toloraya, a Russian diplomat who spent many years in North Korea. North Korea's news agency said this photo showed citizens celebrating a nuclear test He says Russia's position is motivated by a principle, rather than concern over lost trade. President Putin himselfdescribed energy exports to its neighbour as ""practically zero"", though some 30,000 North Koreans are employed in logging and construction in Russia's Far East. They are essentially hired out by the state which pockets most of their pay. ""It's not about whether Russia has any leverage. The question is why should we use that?"" Mr Toloraya asks. ""Our whole concept does not allow for the isolation and strangulation of North Korea, and the weakening of the regime,"" he explains. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? What if Trump cut ties with North Korea's trade partners? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? Like China, Russia shares a border with North Korea and sees it as a buffer against South Korea, a political and military ally of the US. Moscow and Beijing have presented their own road map for resolving the conflict. As a first step, it calls for a joint freeze of Pyongyang's missile tests - and US and South Korean military exercises. The next step would be bringing all sides together for talks. Some suggest that strategy is more about posturing than peace: that Russia wants to insert itself into another global crisis. ""Russia knows that plan won't fly, but it makes the US look bad,"" Alexander Gabuev argues. ""At least China and Russia have a peaceful programme, whereas the US president is just tweeting about fire and fury."" He believes Moscow's leverage with Pyongyang these days is minimal, despite years of Soviet support for the regime. South Korean President Moon Jae-in (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) in Vladivostok, which felt the tremors from Pyongyang's latest missile test But this week, following a trip to China, President Putin hosted the leaders of South Korea and Japan at an economic forum in eastern Russia, also attended by a delegation from North Korea. They were in Vladivostok, which felt the tremors from Pyongyang's latest missile test. ""It's in our interests to have a peaceful, stable neighbour,"" Georgy Toloraya argues. ""As for North Korea, Russia is the least hostile of all the great powers involved in resolving this crisis,"" he says, insisting that historic ties mean Russia still knows ""many people"" who matter there. A guard at the Tumangan border crossing between Russia and North Korea A few years back, President Putin wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. Recent efforts to improve ties have included a ferry service to the peninsula, and even a North Korean tourism agency in Moscow, presumably banking on a rush of visitors keen to sniff flowers named after its leaders. The ferry has since been suspended due to lack of demand. All this is unfolding as Russia's relations with Washington have plummeted amid allegations of interference in the US elections, sanctions and tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions. The US wants to target the personal assets of North Korean President Kim Jong-un That gives Moscow little incentive to back the US against Pyongyang. It knows the power to reward Russia by lifting sanctions now lies with a hostile US Congress. Meanwhile, Russian ties with China have been increasing in importance. How much leverage does China have over North Korea? So the two continue to push for talks as the best way to prevent an accidental escalation of the Korean crisis into actual conflict. ""The Americans need to make contact [with Pyongyang] and the sooner the better. We can pass information on, if they want,"" says Mr Toloraya. ""Talks can go on for 10 or 20 years if necessary. But for that time we would have stability, not this creep towards war.""

"Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo will conduct the concert for the second year in a row After two months and 74 concerts, the 2017 Proms season draws to a close on Saturday with the world-famous Last Night concert. Led by Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo, the celebration will spill across the UK with events in Enniskillen, Glasgow, Swansea and London's Hyde Park. At the Royal Albert Hall, anti-Brexit campaigners are planning to hand out thousands of EU flags to the audience. They say the action is ""in support of EU musicians,external"" who play in the UK. A similar attempt last year did not overwhelm the Last Night celebrations, as fans waved flags from all around the world - Germany, Australia, Denmark, Wales and Cornwall - alongside the more traditional Union flag. Earlier this summer, the Royal Albert Hallwas forced to deny,externalit had ""banned the EU flag"" from concerts, following several press reports. EU anthem played at Proms' first night Last Night of the Proms: Everything you need to know 20 memorable moments from the 2017 Proms Eight mysteries buried in the Proms' season Performers at the Last Night include percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie (Northern Ireland), Kinks star Sir Ray Davies (Hyde Park) and Swedish soprano Nina Stemme (Royal Albert Hall). ""It's a dream I didn't dare dreaming when I was a young student,"" said Stemme, who will reprise her award-winning performance of Tristan and Isolde. ""And now it's coming true. Who would ever have thought this?"" We spoke to the Swedish star and other stars of the Proms to find out what the spectacular evening has in store. Composer Lotta Wennakoski gets to open the Last Night concert, with the world premiere of her latest work, Flounce. What's the story behind the piece? I was commissioned by the BBC - and then I was asked to give them a title before I had written anything! So I have a little place where I collect words and sentences I like - and there, I happened to have the title Flounce, which I like because it has two meanings. So I chose the title first and then I began to elaborate my material, according to those two meanings. How do you approach writing for the Proms? I knew it was the opening number, so I knew it shouldn't be too introverted. And I also knew it's a special concert that's characterised by lots of shorter pieces, so I thought 'OK, this is not the place for meditation', so it had to be festive and, on the other hand, careful. Presumably once it's played, you can relax and enjoy the night. Yes! That's the best thing! Because usually the composer cannot really listen to anything before their own piece. Is there anything in the programme you're looking forward to? I've printed out the words for Britain's National Anthem because I want to sing along as accurately as possible! In fact, I actually know some of it in Finnish - because when I was in school we had to sing all the anthems.  I remember some of it still [she sings] ""Jumala  suojaa hallitsija"" I know the Soviet Union anthem in Finnish, too! Best known as a TV presenter and stand-up comic, Jason Manford will be singing songs from the musicals at Glasgow's Proms in the Park. It's the first time he'll perform the music he's recorded for his debut album, A Different Stage. I'm glad you chose something low-key to launch your singing career. I know, it's crazy isn't it? When they asked me, I was like, ""Er, are you sure?"" But I know I can do it. Fundamentally, I wouldn't do it if I was blagging it. So there won't be a Milli Vanilli moment? The music stops and Alfie Boe comes out from behind a curtain? No, there'll be none of that. I mean, I've heard of this auto-tune magic, but no-one's shown it me yet. So what will you perform? We're going to do Hushabye Mountain from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which I should know by now, having sung it 500 times [in the West End]. And we're doing Stars from Les Mis. I have to say, you sing it better than Russell Crowe. Well you know, that's not a compliment! I'm not the sort of person to complain, but he phoned that in, didn't he? I remember I went to see the film on the night it was released because I'm a huge fan. It was like one minute past midnight, with all these Les Mis uber-fans - and they were cheering every song, until he sung that. It went so quiet in the cinema; and at the end, when Javert jumps off the bridge, the crowd cheered! But I'm sure he's not bothered what I think. Have you ever been to the Proms before? No, not really. It's never really been in my social calendar. I've seen it on telly, like everyone else. I love that family vibe. I love that people bring picnics and deckchairs. I just think that's a terribly British way of doing things. Have you checked the forecast for Glasgow? I was going to mention that! Most of these events, you say to the organisers, ""Oh, what's the dress code?"" and they'll come back and say ""lounge suit"" or ""black tie"". This time, they came back saying, ""make sure you're dressed for the weather!"" Regularly described as ""the greatest dramatic soprano in the world,"" Stemme will treat audiences to a reprise of her signature role in Tristan und Isolde. You've played the Proms before but never the Last Night. How are you feeling? For me, it's a dream I didn't dare dreaming when I was a young student. And now it's coming true. Who would ever have thought this? It's such an honour. Tristan and Isolde has followed you around your whole career, ever since you performed it at Glyndebourne. What do you connect to in that character? Everything - the psychological situations and the music. I can't wait to see what Sakari Omoro brings out of it. It changes from one performance to the next and that's the wonderful thing about music. Did you see Juan Diego Florez's costume at last year's Last Night? I had a little glimpse of it on YouTube. What an outfit! Juan Diego Florez dressed as Manco Capac, governor and founder of the Inca civilization, at the 2016 Proms Have you got something similar planned? It's entirely up to us, so we'll see what I can come up with! A little bit of craziness, and a little bit of theatre history as well. Ahead of the first night, pianist Igor Levit said the one thing he needed before playing was chocolate. Do you have any rituals or essentials? At the beginning, when I sang my first Isolde, I had to have a bowl of pasta but apparently my metabolism has changed! I tend to go into myself, save my voice. I try to look perfectly normal from the outside - but I think my friends and colleagues can see through me. Last Night is unique and a little bit bizarre. Is there anything else that compares? I don't think so! I haven't come across anything like it - but if someone can come up with something similar, please let me know because it's so wonderful. It's musical craziness and I love it. I've got family coming from Sweden, and my brother-in-law is preparing them for everything. They have flags and song texts. I think it's wonderful. For the sixth year in a row, Richard Balcombe will conduct the BBC Concert Orchestra at the Hyde Park leg of Proms In The Park; accompanying artists including Sir Bryn Terfel, Sir Ray Davies and pop group Steps. You've done five of these now. How do you gear up for it? It's one of the most exciting dates I do, because of the sheer size of it. When you look out and see 35,000 people looking back, it sort of stirs the soul. How long do you get to rehearse with someone like Ray Davies? We had two sessions with him on Wednesday, and a soundcheck in the Park on Friday - so altogether nine hours. [The orchestra will be conducted by David Temple, of the Crouch End Festival Chorus during Davies' performance]. That's not a lot of timeâ¦ Actually, in terms of what the orchestra does regularly, that's quite a decent time. For a regular Friday night performance, for example, we'll have two rehearsals before the concert goes out live on the radio. They're the finest, they read anything and just play it. Do you ever wander out into the crowd at Hyde Park? Yes, because my wife comes and we bring a whole group of people from our village, so during the pre-show entertainment, which starts about five, I go out and enjoy the atmosphere. Of those five you've done before, what's been the highlight? Getting the chance to work with artists like Sir Bryn Terfel, Joseph Calleja the tenor, Vittorio Grigolo - the absolute cream of the crop in terms of classical musicians - but also the chance to be on the stage with Kylie Minogue or Bryan Ferry or The Jacksons. It's an absolute privilege. Is there any part of you that thinks, ""I'd love to be in the Royal Albert Hall tonight?"" Haha! No, there's part of me that wishes I was there but I'm just so happy doing what I'm doing. We contribute a big part to the success of the whole evening, by linking up to the parks through the country, I'm just really happy to be doing my bit.

"NHS staff and terror attack victims and their families have been warned about the risks of using social media in new guidelines issued by NHS England. The guide cautions that internet trolls may subject victims to ""vile and upsetting abuse"", as was seen after the Manchester and London terror attacks. It also warns people to be wary of journalists seeking accounts of events. The process of retelling a story can make people ""relive the worst parts"" of horrific events, it warns. People may say more than they intend to when ""vulnerable, upset or angry"", it adds. The NHS England guide also issues specific advice to younger people, cautioning: ""People will use your information for their own ends and when you're in the heat of the moment you may say more than you intend or later regret."" Regarding trolls, it tells teenagers: ""They can say things like you're only doing something for money or to abuse the system and so on. ""This is incredibly hurtful - which is what the sender intends - and it will upset you, or make you angry and that's never the best time to think about what you tell."" But the guidelines add that social media can also play a positive role in helping victims and families after attacks. It points out that coverage can help people by appealing for help, getting questions answered, or paying tribute to those who have been killed. 29 year-old Martyn Hett lost his life in the Manchester attack Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn died in the Manchester attack, said he was inundated by media attention. ""I had a couple of bad run-ins with people physically turning up at my house, my parents' house and my place of work,"" he told the BBC. ""It was incredibly inappropriate. We'd not even confirmed he'd died at this point, so everything was incredibly raw."" Mr Hett welcomes the guidelines: ""Overall I'm very much in favour of clear guidance being put in place for people, but to be honest I think some basic decency should really cover most of it."" The guide warns NHS staff against ""accidentally revealing something about the incident which is not already in the public domain."" It says: ""Often in terror incidents the receiving hospitals are not named in the media straight away, so don't post that you've had a busy shift dealing with victims, as this will confirm something which isn't already known."" It reminds staff to maintain patient confidentiality and cautions them against tweeting rumours. But Prof Chris Moran, NHS England's clinical lead for trauma, said social media helped doctors respond in the aftermath of the Manchester attack. ""Staff in Manchester were alerted quickly and got to their hospitals before a major incident was even declared,"" he said. ""This real-time reporting helped NHS staff anticipate injuries, numbers of casualties and what they would be dealing with."" He added: ""The flip side to the coin is that misinformation on social media spreads fast and can cause lots of problems, including increased anxiety for patients, families and staff."" This occurred following Manchester whenfake images and rumours circulated online.

"Members of Parliament should be given six months' maternity leave, during which a colleague can cast votes on their behalf, Harriet Harman has said. The former Labour deputy leader, who has had three children while an MP, said a ""proper system of baby leave"" in Parliament was ""long overdue"". Currently maternity and paternity arrangements in Parliament are informal and operate at the party level. A cross-party parliamentary group is due to discuss her proposals next week. The Commons Reference Group on Representation and Inclusion, which was set up last year, is due to make recommendations on maternity, paternity, parental, adoption and caring leave. Under the current system, MPs are not considered employees and are therefore not given formal maternity or paternity leave, and cannot vote if they choose to stay at home. Ms Harman said this system was ""unacceptable"", adding: ""The baby needs time with the mother, the mother needs time with the baby and the constituency needs to be properly represented at all times."" Ms Harman, who has campaigned forlonger periods of paid maternity leave in the UK, said a policy of six months' paid leave would put MPs in line with the civil service. The former Labour deputy leader said MPs should be able to nominate a full-time paid ""maternity cover"" to represent the constituency in their absence. ""Eighteen months' leave for three babies during 35 years' work doesn't seem too much to ask,"" said Ms Harman, who is the longest continuously-serving female MP. How do you campaign with a newborn? Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament Spain breastfeeding MP Bescansa causes stir She added: ""The reality is you cannot be on call for your constituency or voting when you are in labour."" Parliament now has a record 208 women MPs, making up 32% of the House of Commons, many of whom are of child-bearing age. Ms Harman said 17 babies had been born to women MPs since 2010. This video can not be played Who said what, when, and what happened next? MP Chloe Smithbrought her young baby to the House of Commonsso she could take part in the Article 50 vote on the UK leaving the EU in February. Meanwhile, MP Tulip Siddiq, who had her first child in April 2016, has spoken of the lack of support for young mothers in Parliament, telling theEvening Standard,external: ""HR said to me 'there's no standardised maternity leave' and that they haven't had to deal with this 'problem' very often."" Last year, areport,externalinto women in Parliament written by Prof Sarah Childs suggested MPs nursing an infant should be able to vote from home, or nominate a proxy voter who could also table questions and amendments in Parliament. Ms Harman has previously spoken about being unable to take maternity leave while representing her Camberwell and Peckham constituency. ""I was too much on the defensive to insist on formal maternity leave, feeling I had to give the impression that I was coping with everything,"" she wrote in her autobiography, A Woman's Work.

"Eric Bolling is a long-time host at Fox News US television network Fox News has announced it and a host accused of sending lewd messages to female co-workers have decided to ""part ways amicably"". Eric Bolling was suspended in August as the network investigated accusations of inappropriate picture messages. His lawyer described the claims at the time as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". It was the latest of several high-profile harassment cases at the conservative cable news outlet. The allegations first emerged onthe Huffington Post,external, which cited 14 unnamed sources claiming Mr Bolling had sent unsolicited photos of male genitalia to at least two female colleagues at Fox Business and Fox News. After initially suspending Mr Bolling pending an investigation, Fox News announced his departure on Friday. ""We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck,"" the network said in a statement. They also confirmed they were cancelling his show, The Specialists. Mr Bolling's lawyer, Michael Bowe had previously told the Reuters news agency that he intended to co-operate with the investigation so Mr Bolling could ""return to work as quickly as possible.""

"This video can not be played This is what the southern region of Mexico woke up to after an 8.1 magnitude quake The race to rescue those trapped in the rubble continues, nearly 48 hours after a powerful earthquake struck off Mexico's southern coast. The 8.1 magnitude quake left at least 65 people dead, according to officials. Another 200 people were injured, President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said, as he declared a national day of mourning. Meanwhile, the feared category one Hurricane Katia, which struck Veracruz on the east coast on Saturday, has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The US National Hurricane Center reported Katia had been rapidly weakening since making landfall, but local officials are worried the storm could still cause landslides and flooding. BBC in depth - Earthquakes A history of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? Rescue efforts following the earthquake, which struck late on Thursday, are focussing on the worst-hit states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Chiapas. Tens of thousands of emergency packs, as well as 100 extra police officers and rescue dogs were sent to JuchitÃ¡n, Oaxaca, which was the most affected town. The earthquake is the most powerful anywhere in the world since September 2015, but its depth - 70kmaccording to the US Geological Survey,external- means that the shaking felt at the surface was less strong than it would have been for an equally powerful but shallower tremor. President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto speaks in JuchitÃ¡n on Friday At least 37 people have been reported dead in JuchitÃ¡n, according to the Milenio newspaper. The town hall and a number of other buildings destroyed or badly damaged. ""The situation is JuchitÃ¡n is critical; this is the most terrible moment in its history,"" said Mayor Gloria Sanchez. Police officer Vidal Vera, 29, who had not slept in more than 36 hours, told AFP: ""I can't remember an earthquake this terrible. ""The whole city is a disaster zone right now. Lots of damage. Lots of deaths. I don't know how you can make sense of it. It's hard. My sister-in-law's husband died. His house fell on top of him."" Mr PeÃ±a Nieto, who visited the town on Friday, said flags would fly at half-mast on Saturday out of respect for the dead and bereaved. The president said 45 deaths had been reported in Oaxaca, 12 in Chiapas and four in Tabasco. Parts of the town hall in JuchitÃ¡n were levelled The BBC's Arturo Wallace says the affected region is the poorest and least developed part of Mexico and the full extent of the damage is yet to become clear. At least one other person was killed in Guatemala, its president has said. The huge quake struck at 23:50 local time on Thursday (04:50 GMT Friday), shaking buildings and causing panic hundreds of miles away in the capital, Mexico City. Patients at a hospital in Villahermosa, Tabasco state, were moved into the open after the quake struck The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning and the evacuation of thousands of people in coastal communities in Chiapas. The warning was later lifted. Throughout Friday, the region was shaken with scores of aftershocks. President PeÃ±a Nieto's office said he would travel to Chiapas to survey the damage. Pope Francis, addressing an open air Mass on a visit to Colombia, said he was praying ""for those who have lost their lives and their families"". The earthquake was more powerful than the 1985 tremor which hit close to Mexico City and caused thousands of deaths. Correspondents say the death toll appears to have been lower because it struck further away from highly populated areas. This video can not be played A bowling alley shakes in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 240km from the epicentre Journalist Franc Contreras, who was in Mexico City, told the BBC: ""You could hear loud cracks in the concrete.

"All restaurants and takeaways in England should be made to display their food hygiene scores by law, the Local Government Association (LGA) has said. The body that represents councils in England says the move should be made as part of the post Brexit legislation. Outlets are scored zero to five based on factors such as kitchen cleanliness, cooking methods and food management. The Food Standards Agency, which runs the scheme, said it was reviewing how food businesses were regulated. The FSA also oversees the rating system in Wales and Northern Ireland, where displaying the scores is compulsory, while inScotland they must display similar food hygiene information,external. In England, food outlets do not have to display the rating. The FSA conducted asurvey,externalin 2012 that showed 43% of restaurants and other food businesses in England put up a score, which fell to 32% in London. For businesses with a low rating - between zero and two - the figures fell to 12% across England and 9% in London. Chris Barber, who advises restaurants on their business, said compulsory display would be ""absolutely revolutionary"". ""This is going to have the same impact as when it was first brought in - a massive kick up the backside. ""This is going to be an even bigger kick up the backside."" The LGA said much existing food safety legislation comes from the European Union and it was important it was not weakened after Brexit. The government plans toconvert EU law into domestic legislation as part of its EU (Withdrawal) Billand councils want ministers to take that opportunity to strengthen regulation by making all restaurants and takeaways in England display their ""scores on the doors"" for food hygiene. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said EU food standards must be protected after Brexit. ""Food hygiene standards and compliance levels have risen since the scheme was introduced in Wales,"" he said. ""The lack of a hygiene rating sticker in a business means customers are left in the dark on official kitchen cleanliness levels when eating or buying food there."" Evidence from a prosecution in Leyton, east London The FSA said it was hoping to bring plans to improve regulation forward for England to ministers by 2020. ""Mandatory display is part of the FSA's plans for a new model of regulation but implementation will require legislation,"" a spokesman said. ""We want to bring the food hygiene rating scheme in England in line with Wales and Northern Ireland, where the benefits of more visible ratings have already been felt."" Recent food hygiene prosecutions include: In east London the owner of aChinese restaurant,externalwas fined and banned for life from operating a food business after multiple safety breaches in its cockroach infested kitchen In west London a fast food restaurant and its owners wereordered,externalto pay almost Â£20,000 after they repeatedly ignored improvement warnings.

"Students are paying more for their university education in England than ever before There has been a call for an urgent inquiry into problems at the Student Loans Company which led to the suspension of its chief executive. Shadow Universities Minister Gordon Marsden said the firm was near ""meltdown"" and urged the Universities Minister to address the problems. The Department for Education suspended Steve Lamey in July without saying why. A DfE spokesman defended the student loans system and said Jo Johnson would respond in due course. In early July, a statement from the DfE said: ""The Student Loans Company, in consultation with the Department for Education, took the decision to suspend the chief executive, pending an investigation into concerns which have been raised. ""The suspension is a neutral act and does not imply wrongdoing. ""As the matters leading to suspension are now subject to an independent investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" But this week, Mr Marsden wrote to Mr Johnson, asking him to clarify the details around the suspension and the nature of the associated investigation. He told the BBC: ""Whilst the full details have yet to become clear, the Student Loans Company appears to be approaching a situation of meltdown. ""There needs to be an urgent, substantial inquiry into all aspects of the way they operate with HMRC."" His letter continues: ""This worrying situation has been compounded by an ongoing stream of accounts over the past few months in the media, and based on numerous individual stories appearing, of the inadequacies of the Student Loans Company to properly administer student loans and specifically repayments."" He highlighted that the number of student loan customers who had overpaid their debts rose to 86,000 in 2015-16, from 52,000 in 2009-10. And he asked Mr Johnson to set out what steps he and his officers were taking to address the issue. He called for a review of the system of communications between HMRC and the company, after reports that the SLC was only getting salary information on borrowers at the end of the tax year. This is thought to have led to more overpayments by customers than may have been necessary. He wrote: ""The deteriorating situation suggests that there are significant management pressures at the SLC, both in processing this information and then in rectifying overpayments. ""So are you able to give assurances that there will be no further cuts in staffing resource or capacity at the SLC?"" A spokesman for the DfE defended the student loans system, which debits money directly from earnings through the tax system, saying it was fair. The spokesman said: ""No borrower need overpay their loan. ""The SLC gives all borrowers the option to repay by direct debit two years before they are due to repay their loan and borrowers who take up this option will not overpay."" Any borrower who believes they have overpaid should contact the SLC as soon as possible. Mr Marsden pointed out that the problems at the firm come at a time when some students leave university with debts of up to Â£57,000. He also raised the issue ofgraduates facing the prospect of paying 6.1% on their student loanswhile the Bank of England base rate is 0.25%. The interest rate is due to rise soon from 4.6%. He said that, without action, the confidence of existing graduates and future students would continue to erode, to the detriment of the sector. Why are student loan interest rates so high?

"The most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade has caused widespread destruction across the Caribbean and the southern US, leaving 55 people dead. Irma, at times a category five hurricane, packed winds of up to 295km/h (185mph). The storm cut a devastating trail across Caribbean countries and territories before moving up through the US states of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, weakening into a tropical depression. An estimated 1.2 million people have been affected. At its peak, Irma was a category five storm with winds topping 295km/h (185mph).  According toPhil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science,external, Irma's top wind speeds were tied with the second-strongest maximum winds of all time for an Atlantic hurricane.  Irma matches a 1935 storm in the Florida Keys, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Wilma in 2005. Only one hurricane, Allen in 1980, has recorded stronger winds, at 190 mph, he said. However, Irma broke Allen's record for sustained winds. It maintained maximum wind speeds of 295km/h for longer than any other Atlantic Hurricane. This video can not be played NOAA satellite images of Hurricane Irma The remnants of Hurricane Harvey, which hit in late August, could still be seen by satellite when Irma made its way across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean.

Irma grew stronger quickly because of a combination of very warm water, high levels of mid-level relative humidity, and vertical wind conditions, meteorologists say. Between 2 and 5 September, Irma strengthened from a category three to a category five storm, the highest possible level. By 7 September, Irma was being followed by storm Jose, which was also upgraded to hurricane status. Also present was Storm Katia in the Gulf of Mexico, which became a hurricane before it hit the Mexican state of Veracruz. Two people died in a mudslide caused by the extreme weather. Katia, Irma and Jose, 7 September Infrared data from theNasa-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Suomi NPP satellite on 7 September,externalrevealed very cold, very high, powerful thunderstorms stretching around Irma's northern, eastern and southern sides. Storms with cloud tops reaching very low temperatures have the capability to generate ""very heavy rainfall"", according to Nasa. Infrared image of Irma, 7 September Cloud-top temperatures at the centre of the storm were as cold as 190 Kelvin (minus 83.1C/117.7F), Nasa said. The eye of the storm measured about 35 miles across and generated ""extreme rainfall"". Nasa rainfall analysis of Irma's eye, 5 September . Nasa's rainfall analysis showed rain falling at a rate of more than 274mm (10.8in) per hour on 5 September in the solid ring of storms within Irma's eye. The powerful storms rotating around the eye were really tall, reaching altitudes greater than 12.5km (7.75 miles). But the tallest thunderstorms were found south west of Irma's eye, reaching heights of more than 16.2km (10 miles), Nasa said. Warm oceans, along with wind speed and direction, are the two key ingredients that fuel and sustain hurricanes. As Irma approached Florida, it passed over waters that are warmer than 30C (86F) - hot enough to sustain a category five storm,according to Nasa scientists.,external Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico temperatures The green line on the map tracks Irma's path between 3 and 6 September. Hurricane Irma has hit many of the Caribbean's islands, and made landfall in Florida on Sunday. Places hit: Antigua and Barbuda St Martin St Barts (Saint BarthÃ©lemy) Anguilla British Virgin Islands Puerto Rico Dominican Republic Haiti Turks and Caicos Cuba Bahamas Florida Huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Storm surges were caused across the south of Florida. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

"Carolyn Saddington says her bills have risen by thousands of pounds Backdated tax demands being sent to businesses with offices in communal blocks are ""particularly unfair"", the head of a committee of MPs has said. Dubbed the ""staircase tax"" by critics, business rates in England and Wales are being set depending on how many rooms are being used and how they are linked. Those with more than one office linked by a communal lift, corridors or stairs are being charged more. Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan has questioned the move. In a letter to Melissa Tatton, chief executive of the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), which sets the rates, Mrs Morgan has asked how many businesses are being hit and what is being done to mitigate the impact. ""On the face of it, it seems unfair to tax businesses differently depending solely on whether the staircases between their rooms are communal or private,"" she said. ""It seems particularly unfair for the increase in rates to be backdated. I have written to Ms Tatton to ascertain the reasons for the VOA backdating it. "" Small firms hit by rates relief delay The change - and the backdating of rates - was the result of a ruling in the Supreme Court which the VOA said had clarified the law and given it no choice but to send the fresh demands. Among those to have received them is Carolyn Saddington, the director of digital marketing agency Loyalty Matters, based in Harrogate. The 54-year-old said the agency was spread over three offices on two floors of a building. ""Our offices - because they are separated by a [communal] staircase and a small amount of carpet - are now assessed by the Valuation Office as three separate properties,"" she told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. She said if they had an office that was a single unit, then they would be eligible for 100% rate relief, but the current situation meant they would only receive relief on one office and had to pay rates on the other two. She has received a backdated rates demand of Â£4,000 and a charge of Â£2,000 a year from now on. It was ""a bit of shock"", she said. ""The ridiculous thing is that there is a wall between two offices. We could knock a door through then the Valuation Office would have to assess it as one property. It is absolutely crazy,"" she added. Mrs Morgan, in her letter, questions why the recalculated rates are being backdated. She also asked whether there is any analysis on the winners and losers under the new rules. She has also asked for details on how many businesses are affected, an estimate of the typical increase or fall in rates, and what transitional relief is available. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) estimates that 80,000 properties are affected. It said the levy was ""ridiculous"" and there was cross-party support in Parliament to help affected businesses. ""No small business should receive a sudden tax hike of 5,000% simply because a workspace has been separated, for years, by a communal area, stairway or lift. Some small business owners are discussing whether to knock holes in their walls or stick a staircase on the outside of their premises,"" said Mike Cherry, national chairman of the FSB.

"NHS staff and terror attack victims and their families have been warned about the risks of using social media in new guidelines issued by NHS England. The guide cautions that internet trolls may subject victims to ""vile and upsetting abuse"", as was seen after the Manchester and London terror attacks. It also warns people to be wary of journalists seeking accounts of events. The process of retelling a story can make people ""relive the worst parts"" of horrific events, it warns. People may say more than they intend to when ""vulnerable, upset or angry"", it adds. The NHS England guide also issues specific advice to younger people, cautioning: ""People will use your information for their own ends and when you're in the heat of the moment you may say more than you intend or later regret."" Regarding trolls, it tells teenagers: ""They can say things like you're only doing something for money or to abuse the system and so on. ""This is incredibly hurtful - which is what the sender intends - and it will upset you, or make you angry and that's never the best time to think about what you tell."" But the guidelines add that social media can also play a positive role in helping victims and families after attacks. It points out that coverage can help people by appealing for help, getting questions answered, or paying tribute to those who have been killed. 29 year-old Martyn Hett lost his life in the Manchester attack Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn died in the Manchester attack, said he was inundated by media attention. ""I had a couple of bad run-ins with people physically turning up at my house, my parents' house and my place of work,"" he told the BBC. ""It was incredibly inappropriate. We'd not even confirmed he'd died at this point, so everything was incredibly raw."" Mr Hett welcomes the guidelines: ""Overall I'm very much in favour of clear guidance being put in place for people, but to be honest I think some basic decency should really cover most of it."" The guide warns NHS staff against ""accidentally revealing something about the incident which is not already in the public domain."" It says: ""Often in terror incidents the receiving hospitals are not named in the media straight away, so don't post that you've had a busy shift dealing with victims, as this will confirm something which isn't already known."" It reminds staff to maintain patient confidentiality and cautions them against tweeting rumours. But Prof Chris Moran, NHS England's clinical lead for trauma, said social media helped doctors respond in the aftermath of the Manchester attack. ""Staff in Manchester were alerted quickly and got to their hospitals before a major incident was even declared,"" he said. ""This real-time reporting helped NHS staff anticipate injuries, numbers of casualties and what they would be dealing with."" He added: ""The flip side to the coin is that misinformation on social media spreads fast and can cause lots of problems, including increased anxiety for patients, families and staff."" This occurred following Manchester whenfake images and rumours circulated online.

"This video can not be played This is what the southern region of Mexico woke up to after an 8.1 magnitude quake The race to rescue those trapped in the rubble continues, nearly 48 hours after a powerful earthquake struck off Mexico's southern coast. The 8.1 magnitude quake left at least 65 people dead, according to officials. Another 200 people were injured, President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said, as he declared a national day of mourning. Meanwhile, the feared category one Hurricane Katia, which struck Veracruz on the east coast on Saturday, has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The US National Hurricane Center reported Katia had been rapidly weakening since making landfall, but local officials are worried the storm could still cause landslides and flooding. BBC in depth - Earthquakes A history of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? Rescue efforts following the earthquake, which struck late on Thursday, are focussing on the worst-hit states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Chiapas. Tens of thousands of emergency packs, as well as 100 extra police officers and rescue dogs were sent to JuchitÃ¡n, Oaxaca, which was the most affected town. The earthquake is the most powerful anywhere in the world since September 2015, but its depth - 70kmaccording to the US Geological Survey,external- means that the shaking felt at the surface was less strong than it would have been for an equally powerful but shallower tremor. President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto speaks in JuchitÃ¡n on Friday At least 37 people have been reported dead in JuchitÃ¡n, according to the Milenio newspaper. The town hall and a number of other buildings destroyed or badly damaged. ""The situation is JuchitÃ¡n is critical; this is the most terrible moment in its history,"" said Mayor Gloria Sanchez. Police officer Vidal Vera, 29, who had not slept in more than 36 hours, told AFP: ""I can't remember an earthquake this terrible. ""The whole city is a disaster zone right now. Lots of damage. Lots of deaths. I don't know how you can make sense of it. It's hard. My sister-in-law's husband died. His house fell on top of him."" Mr PeÃ±a Nieto, who visited the town on Friday, said flags would fly at half-mast on Saturday out of respect for the dead and bereaved. The president said 45 deaths had been reported in Oaxaca, 12 in Chiapas and four in Tabasco. Parts of the town hall in JuchitÃ¡n were levelled The BBC's Arturo Wallace says the affected region is the poorest and least developed part of Mexico and the full extent of the damage is yet to become clear. At least one other person was killed in Guatemala, its president has said. The huge quake struck at 23:50 local time on Thursday (04:50 GMT Friday), shaking buildings and causing panic hundreds of miles away in the capital, Mexico City. Patients at a hospital in Villahermosa, Tabasco state, were moved into the open after the quake struck The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning and the evacuation of thousands of people in coastal communities in Chiapas. The warning was later lifted. Throughout Friday, the region was shaken with scores of aftershocks. President PeÃ±a Nieto's office said he would travel to Chiapas to survey the damage. Pope Francis, addressing an open air Mass on a visit to Colombia, said he was praying ""for those who have lost their lives and their families"". The earthquake was more powerful than the 1985 tremor which hit close to Mexico City and caused thousands of deaths. Correspondents say the death toll appears to have been lower because it struck further away from highly populated areas. This video can not be played A bowling alley shakes in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 240km from the epicentre Journalist Franc Contreras, who was in Mexico City, told the BBC: ""You could hear loud cracks in the concrete.

The hurricane made landfall on the Camaguey Archipelago, in Cuba's north-east, as a category five storm but has now weakened to a category three. The Bahamas have largely been spared. In Florida, 5.6 million people, or 25% of the US state's population, have been told to leave as the storm approaches. At least 20 people are known to have died so far across the Caribbean. Irma hit the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago late on Friday, threatening nearby coastal towns and villages. It was the first category five hurricane to hit Cuba in decades. It weakened to category three by Saturday lunchtime but is expected to strengthen again as it approaches Florida.
