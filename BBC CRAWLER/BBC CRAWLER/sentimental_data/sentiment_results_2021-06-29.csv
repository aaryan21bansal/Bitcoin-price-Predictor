"A winner of one of Brewdog's ""solid gold"" beer cans has asked the advertising watchdog to investigate its claim the prize is worth Â£15,000. The Scottish firm offered 10 people the chance to find a gold can hidden in a case of its beer. Some winners questioned the worth after discovering the cans are gold plated, and one has asked the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to probe whether any rules were broken. Brewdog stands by the valuation. A company spokesperson said the use of the term ""solid gold"" was a mistake, but it stood by its Â£15,000 claim, saying the estimate was made up of more than just the metal used. The ASA confirmed it was looking into the matter after it was contacted by sales manager Adam Dean, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Mr Dean told the BBC: ""I realised I had won after I treated myself to a can after having mowed the lawn and spotted something glistening away in the case. ""It said on the can 'you've won a Â£15k 24 carat gold Hazy Jane can'. Once I'd got over the shock I wanted to cover it on my house insurance. I got in touch with the can's makers, Thomas Lyte, who told me it was actually brass with a 24 carat gold plating. ""I had it valued by a jewellery expert. He told me it was only worth Â£500. I'm just totally disappointed and I want it resolved. I legally entered a competition to win a solid gold can but I've not got that. I asked for shares to make it up to Â£15,000 and Brewdog basically said no, so I called the ASA."" He said the ASA had asked for all the emails he's received from the company and told him it will  ""assess my concerns"". Mark Craig with his prize Another winner, Mark Craig, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, asked for a valuation after he won his gold can and discovered it was actually made of gold-plated brass. He told the BBC: ""If you're told something is worth Â£15,000, that's what you would hope you had sitting on your mantelpiece. I bought two cases online in my attempt to win. ""The past 18 months have been tough for everyone. I myself was made redundant and had plenty of need of extra cash. I wanted to sell the can and contacted Brewdog for any certification they had. ""The certificate they sent said it was gold-plated but they promoted it as solid gold. When I contacted them they told me the 'solid gold' claim was an error. ""It's not just me that's been let down. Lots of people have lost out on this. Buying extra beer - and buying it online from them directly handing them a higher share of the profits."" Brewdog said in a statement: ""We have reached out to Mark privately to apologise for the erroneous use of the phrasing 'solid gold' in some of the communications around the competition. Once the error was flagged by our internal teams, we immediately removed or changed all such mentions. ""This error may have informed his complaint regarding the value of the can. Importantly, the phrasing in question was never included in the detailed terms and conditions of the competition, nor in the wording informing the lucky winners of their prize."" The company said the Â£15,000 value was ""reasonable based on multiple factors"", including the manufacturing price, metal, and quality of the product. Brewdog added that the cans were collectible items, with the value ""somewhat detached from the cost of materials"". The ASA said in a statement: ""A complainant has challenged whether the claim that the prize was solid gold is misleading as they believe it's not made from solid gold and rather brass and gold plating. ""They have also challenged whether another ad is misleading as they understand the can is not worth Â£15 000."" Brewdog's co-founder, James Watt It said it was assessing the complaint to establish whether or not it needed to take action. Brewdog was founded in 2007 by boss James Watt and Martin Dickie. It has been attracting negative scrutiny in recent weeks aftera letter from ex-workers was posted on Twitter,externalwhich said a ""significant number"" of former staff had ""suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog"". It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. The company has promised an independent review of the beer firm and has apologised to staff for the ""lot of pain"" they have been caused. The fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions.

"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to ""disastrous consequences for families and for communities"". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. ""I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,"" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and ""finding them deceased"". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

The tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs. Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been ""almost impossible"" to go outside. ""It's been intolerable,"" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper.,external""We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47."" This video can not be played Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: ""I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again."" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. Stay cool.It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water.Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade.Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing.Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods.If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told theSeattle Times,externalthe number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. ""It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,"" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners. Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: ""Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous."" Amazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.

"The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages The European Union (EU) has agreed to a three-month delay to a ban on some meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. The proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Brexit deal between the UK and EU in 2019. The EU and UK agreed to extend a so-called grace period - the time before the ban comes into effect. The new arrangement means the meat ban will be postponed until 30 September. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was ""accommodating"" the UK's request to extend the grace period but was ""not issuing a blank cheque"". ""This solution is of a temporary nature, in which strong conditions are attached,"" he added. ""This extension will allow stakeholders, and especially supermarkets in Northern Ireland, to continue to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation - something yet to be completed. ""What is equally important, we hope that during these three months, the UK will engage constructively on the broader agreement in the areas of public, animal, and plant health based on alignment with EU rules."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ  added that the EU Commission had put forward ""solutions in a number of other areas"" including the continued supply of medicines and for guide dogs, as well as a decision waiving the need for Northern Ireland motorists to show an insurance green card when driving in EU countries. He said: ""These solutions help to ensure that the application of the protocol impacts as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland. ""They highlight the EU's commitment to - and ability to deliver - solutions that work."" The EU said it had ""identified a solution to facilitate the movements of guide dogs"" accompanying those travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but details had to be worked out. Current rules mean assistance dogs are not exempt from paperwork and vaccines needed to bring pets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The broad agreement was welcomed by the UK's Brexit Minister, Lord Frost, who described it as a ""sensible extension"". ""This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution - Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years,"" he said.

The deal was announced on the same day thata High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the Northern Ireland Protocol was lawful. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal thatcreates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. This video can not be played Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol Lord Frost helped to negotiate the NI Protocol on behalf of the UK government but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. In a statement after Wednesday's deal, he said: ""This is a very clear sign that the protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way. ""The chilled meats issue is only one of a very large number of problems with the way the protocol is currently operating, and solutions need to be found with the EU to ensure it delivers on its original aims: to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, safeguard Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, and protect the EU's single market for goods."" The Labour Party's shadow minister for task force Europe, Baroness Chapman, welcomed the decision but urged Boris Johnson ""not to waste"" the extension. Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the extension showed that the EU was delivering solutions to a range of issues raised by the protocol. ""I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK's request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats,"" he said. ""This co-operative approach recognises that the protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented. The only sustainable solutions are those agreed together. ""Today's announcement also ensures continued access to vital medicines in Northern Ireland as well as addressing issues relating to motor insurance green cards, guide dogs and the movement of certain animals."" Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that EU-UK work on resolving differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol was of a ""stop-start nature"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) he said there was goodwill on the issue on the part of EU leaders but that the UK needed to engage. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. EU set to agree delay to NI Protocol meat ban What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU single market. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. It is this grace period relating to chilled meats which has now been extended. 47% of people in NI say the protocol is not appropriate for NI, while 47% say it is, a new poll suggests Meanwhile new poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests people in Northern Ireland are evenly split on the protocol. Almost 70% of respondents agreed that Northern Ireland needs 'particular arrangements' for managing the impact of Brexit but they are divided on the protocol itself. When asked whether the protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% agree that it is but 47% disagree. Similarly, 43% think that the protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think that it isn't. Nevertheless, 56% agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities. Professor Katy Hayward, from Queen's University Belfast and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: ""People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against - and in equal proportions. 'The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next assembly election."" The online polling was carried out by LucidTalk, surveying a weighted sample of 1,500 adults. It has a margin of error of up to 3%.

"This video can not be played Leah, 18, tried to take her own life after struggling during the pandemic Thousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives. Most said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled. More than 3,300 people took part in the research carried out by the BBC. Disability charity Scope said the findings confirmed that disabled people's needs ""had been forgotten"". The findings paint, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of a hidden fallout of Covid-19. Nearly 100 more disabled people also contacted the BBC wanting to share their stories. Many of them had experienced huge physical and mental decline since March 2020.  2,604said mental health had got worse 2,427disability had deteriorated 683had seen all of their appointments cancelled/unable to attend 241had not left house at all There were young people with autism who had attempted suicide because they could no longer cope with drastic changes, others were isolated and alone, their support networks gone or hours of care cut. Access to healthcare was a huge issue - one woman was told not to go to hospital if she contracted Covid as this might put her more at risk. A family told how care had been almost stopped for their disabled daughter, while her father, who had had Covid, was offered a range of treatments. Fourteen-year-old Josselin has a rare genetic condition, which means she has hearing loss, a vision impairment, can't walk or talk and is fed through a tube. Her family, who live in Wiltshire, have a vital network of services they rely on to keep her well - physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, respite care. All of that stopped in March 2020. ""Josselin really struggled. She just shutdown,"" says her mother Karen Tilley. ""I never thought [she] would suffer from depression like that. ""After about a month she started pulling her hair out and picking at her skin, she had cuts all over her arms."" Josselin was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy. ""Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous."" At the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19. He spent five weeks on a ventilator in intensive care. Lee is back home making small and slow steps to, the family hope, a full recovery. But the difference between the support he is offered and the treatment his daughter receives is stark. His calendar is full of medical appointments. He has an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and he has been sent equipment to help him regain his mobility. But for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits. ""It feels like it's because she's disabled so it's not worth bothering with,"" says Karen. ""She's not ever going to walk and talk so they just don't bother with her."" All the people we have spent time with over the past few months have shared their own, heart-breaking stories. Considering everything they have had thrown at them this past year, they have managed to get through it the best they can, almost entirely on their own. But what really hit me is that none of them kept a ""who had it worse during Covid"" scorecard. Yes, they all pretty much described themselves in one way or another as ""the forgotten ones"", but they were all incredibly measured and understanding of the fact that the pandemic has touched us all in very different ways, disabled or not. Freelance journalist Raya Al Jadir, 43, uses a ventilator. She was told by her specialist doctors that if she caught Covid-19, she should not go to hospital because the level of care she would need could not be guaranteed. She was also warned that it was unlikely that she would be considered for life support. ""It made me feel alone and isolated. If I did end up in hospital and I was really sick - who was going to fight for me?"" Raya was one of the hundreds of disabled people who told the BBC that they would avoid going to hospital during the pandemic. From March 2020 to May 2021, Raya did not leave her house for fear of catching Covid. Shielding may have officially ended but there are still many disabled people living an isolated existence. Nearly 2,000 told the BBC that they had left their house on only a few occasions since the start of the pandemic, with almost 250 saying they had not ventured outside since March 2020. At the end of May, Raya finally left her London flat. ""Breathing the air, seeing the clouds made me feel part of the world again. ""As a disabled person, I feel like the weakest link in society. And now, because of Covid-19, no-one knows what to do with the weakest link. ""I don't think my life will ever return to what it was before March 2020."" One of the biggest disability charities in the UK, Scope, has said the BBC's findings ""confirm the government's failure to provide support for disabled people throughout the pandemic."" ""Millions spent months shielding, having to battle for basic support like healthcare, supermarket deliveries, financial support and social care,"" said James Taylor, executive director at disability equality charity Scope. ""Horrifying reports of DNRs [do-not-resuscitate orders] being placed on people without their consent left many fearing they'd not get treatment if they caught the virus. The government ""must take bold action now to put disabled people at the heart of the recovery, and end the growing inequality"". The Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the pandemic has been ""incredibly difficult"" for disabled people. ""Among other support, we have invested Â£2.4m to help charities offer vital projects to improve disabled people's physical and mental wellbeing. ""The government has provided a range of help for disabled people throughout this period and through our forthcoming National Disability Strategy we are going to go even further in addressing issues that disabled people say affect them the most.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford accused Boris Johnson of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson's government of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament. The first minister has published a report on reforming the ""fragile"" union between the four UK nations. It calls for a partnership between governments, but says relations have recently deteriorated. UK ministers said focusing on constitutional issues was an ""irresponsible"" distraction from Covid. Mr Drakeford said there was an urgent need for change because ""the union has never been this fragile"". The report came asWelsh ministers were granted permission to appealafter their legal challenge to a post-Brexit UK trade law was blocked. The union between the four nations of the UK is ""fragile"", the first minister says ""If matters continue in their current vein the case for the break-up of the UK will only increase,"" the first minister said. ""Too often we see the UK government act in an aggressively unilateral way, claiming to act on behalf of the whole UK, but without regard for the status of the nations and the democratic mandates of their governments."" 'Put politics aside' for Wales' Covid recovery What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? The Labour first minister, an opponent of independence, wants more powers for the Welsh Parliament, including over the justice system. His report says Westminster should allow Wales and Scotland to hold referendums on independence if their devolved parliaments want to, but adds ""it would be unreasonable for such referendums to be held too frequently"". The first minister called for justice powers for the Welsh parliament and government Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should continue to be represented in the House of Commons, the report says, but the membership of the House of Lords should also reflect the make-up of the UK. Funding for the devolved nations should be based on their needs, it says, and the UK government should get consent from Cardiff if it wants to pay for certain things in Wales. It follows a row over replacing EU funding to Wales, with UK government ministers acquiring new powers to fund things that arenormally controlled by the Welsh government. The UK government said the public wanted both administrations to work together In a statement, the UK government said people wanted both administrations to work together ""and our full focus must remain on recovering from the challenges the pandemic has created"". ""Choosing to prioritise constitutional issues in the middle of a pandemic is an irresponsible and unwanted distraction,"" it said. Responding to accusations that UK-wide schemes such as the levelling-up fund undermined devolution, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""What we're trying to do with more visibility and vigour - I'm very proud of the fact - is we are trying to get more money into Wales, more investment into Wales, more jobs into Wales."" On the subject of the union, Mr Hart added: ""For most people it's the comforting knowledge that we are part of a big, historic combination of strengths, and that on balance that it's a force for good,"" pointing to the Covid vaccination programme as an example. Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the UK was ""failing utterly to deliver economic and social justice for the people of Wales"". ""The only way of achieving this is by putting Wales's future in Wales's hands, free from Westminster's chaos and incompetence.

"Foreign business leaders will no longer need to quarantine when arriving in England if their trip is likely to have a significant economic benefit to the UK, the government has announced. The exemption will be for arrivals from amber-list countries, and only given in exceptional circumstances, the Department for Business (BEIS) said. Some business groups and MPs expressed anger as it excludes smaller companies. But BEIS said it would balance economic interests with public safety. Some critics said it should include all business travel and key workers. Labour's Angela Rayner and Manchester's Labour Mayor, Andy Burnham, said it smacked of one rule for the rich and one for the rest. Craig Beaumont, for the Federation of Small Business, said: ""Small business owners and the self-employed often travel for their business, and it is wrong to declare this activity as of no significant economic benefit - and so outside of the government's plans. ""There should not be a fast lane of easements for big business while small firms are left behind."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Medium-sized enterprises will be the powerhouses of our economic recovery, so initiatives that effectively lower quarantine requirements for executives in large businesses seem arbitrary."" Mr Parikh stressed that it was ""vital that the government does not overlook the crucial importance of helping SME business leaders getting back up and running by focusing purely on multinationals"". UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls agreed, telling the BBC this exemption needed to be ""expanded for broader business travel, including hospitality workers abroad who are currently unable to return to the UK due to the cost and hassle of current quarantine requirements"". The plans follow disquiet at perceived double standards for influential guests and dignitaries after sponsors and officials from Uefa and Fifa were allowed into the UK for Euro 2020 without having to quarantine. The exemption is for executives wishing to travel to England to make a ""financial investment in a UK-based business"" or for ""establishing a new business within the UK"". BEIS said: ""This exemption is designed to enable activity that creates and preserves UK jobs and investment, while taking steps to ensure public health risks are minimised."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""Protecting public health is our number one priority and that's why those exemptions will only apply in truly exceptional circumstances."" Business leaders will not qualify for an exemption if the activities can be carried out remotely via telephone or email, or by another person. ""Routine meetings"" and ""speculative sales pitches"" will not qualify. ""Significant economic benefit"" is considered to be having a greater than 50% chance of creating or preserving at least 500 UK-based jobs, or creating a new UK business within two years, BEIS said. Ms Rayner said: ""It is the lowest-paid working people who have got our country through this crisis, risking their lives on the front line. ""Yet again it is one rule for those at the top and another for everyone else."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was the ""wrong move at the wrong time"". ""It can't be one rule for the rich and another for the rest,"" he added. What are the latest changes to the green list for holidays? Hong Kong bans flights from UK over Covid concerns Business leaders visiting England will need to take a Covid-19 test, take further tests on arrival and tell the government they intend to use the exemption, before getting a letter of confirmation. Bosses hoping to use the loophole to attend a routine board meeting will be disappointed, although a meeting to make a decision on whether to invest in a new UK division could be accepted. As with the quarantine exemption for seasonal workers, the business leaders will need to self-isolate whenever they are not conducting the exempt business activity. Travellers from red list countries are not exempt. Business leaders have been primarily carrying out activities remotely during much of the pandemic. But airlines have been pushing hard for restrictions to ease, because sales of business-class and first-class seats - which generate the biggest profits - have plunged as companies adopt remote working. A spokesperson from ABTA, the travel association, told the BBC that while this was a ""step forward"", the roles and activities involved were ""limited, and this will not be not be sufficient to bring about a meaningful recovery in business travel"". Matthew Fell, UK policy director for the CBI business lobby group, told the BBC the measure was a ""welcome step towards taking the pragmatic and truly risk-based approach needed for business travellers in the coming months"".

"Plans had been in place for indoor hospitality in the Republic of Ireland to reopen on 5 July The Irish government is delaying the return of some indoor activities, including hospitality, over increasing cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant. Indoor hospitality was due to reopen on 5 July. When it reopens, it will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. The recommendation was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Irish cabinet met on Tuesday morning to consider the plans. Mr Martin said while there would be an increase in the number of people who could attend outdoor events and the number who can attend weddings would be increased to 50 as planned, ""the return to other indoor activities including hospitality will be delayed"". ""NPHET's clear advice based on the modelling it has done is that given the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the safest way to now proceed with the return of indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid infection,"" he said. ""Over the course of the coming weeks, the government will work urgently with the relevant sectors to agree a practical and workable approach. ""The simple truth is that we are in a race between the variants and the vaccines and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the vaccine wins."" This video can not be played 'Reopening on 5 July would carry a real risk' Mr Martin said he knew his announcement of the delay would be greeted with dismay and frustration. He said the tourism and hospitality sectors had borne a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic and in recognition of this additional supports would be provided in the coming weeks. The taoiseach gave no date for when indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants would resume. Restaurateurs and publicans expressed their anger and frustration at Mr Martin's comments. Cathal Doherty, who owns the Ballyliffin Townhouse Boutique Hotel in County Donegal, said many in the hospitality sector would view Tuesday's announcement as unworkable. ""We obviously have to wait for the full published guidance, but it will be interesting to see how they [the government] can even begin to possibly explain this,"" Mr Doherty said. ""It's beyond confusing, we just seem to be going backwards."" Mr Doherty believes for many small businesses across Ireland the delay for reopening will be seen as the ""final nail in the coffin"". ""If we [the hospitality sector] don't start getting a decent trade in summer then many small businesses are simply not going to make it until winter,"" he said.

The Cabinet Covid Committee had a meeting which lasted until 01:00 local time on Tuesday. During the meeting, the NPHET gave some warnings to the Irish government on Monday, including a ""most pessimistic"" scenario of hundreds of thousands of cases between July and September and more than 2,000 deaths with Covid-19. Meanwhile, TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would now be offered to all age groups after beingpreviously limited to over-50s. The plans have been criticised by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which said it was ""astounded"" that indoor hospitality would face a further delay. In a statement, the group said it believed the policy was discriminatory and unworkable.

He added that many people working in the hospitality sector were in the unvaccinated age groups, and could potentially be asked to refuse service to their peers.

In Northern Ireland,indoor hospitality reopened on 24 May, with restrictions in place on the number of people and households able to meet.

"The video footage from the incident on Sunday evening was shared online Police are investigating video footage which appears to show England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted by two men in a park. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""shocked at seeing the despicable harassment"" of Prof Whitty. The video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself. The Met Police said it happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday and all those involved had been spoken to. The force said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. It added that the incident has been recorded as a common assault and continues to be investigated. The PMtweeted:,external""I condemn the behaviour of these thugs. Our hard-working public servants should not have to face this kind of intimidation on our streets and we will not tolerate it."" Other MPs to criticise the incident included new Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it was ""appalling and totally unacceptable"". He added: ""The CMO (chief medical officer) works tirelessly on behalf of the country... the men behaving in this disgraceful way should be ashamed."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as ""disgusting behaviour"", adding that the police were right to investigate ""this harassment"". Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, tweeted: ""Even if you perceive it as non-violent, it is clear that he felt awful and uncomfortable and resisted. ""Public figures are not dolls, they are human beings, it is stunning how easily this is forgotten."" Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Professor Chris Whitty It is not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Is the answer to Prof Whitty's ordeal police protection? Certainly, if a senior cabinet minister was walking through St James's Park, they would have security watching their back. The word ""harassment"" doesn't convey how shocking the confrontation looks and how vulnerable Prof Whitty must have felt. Nor is it the first time he has been confronted by phone-wielding blokes. His colleague, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, was also accosted by an anti-vaccine activist in Whitehall last week. They are not politicians - they are officials leading efforts to fight a pandemic who have become public figures. So yes, perhaps protection is part of the answer. Westminster is sprinkled with police officers and they guard the gates of Parliament and No 10, but it rarely feels heavily policed unless there is a demonstration under way. Asked whether Prof Whitty and his colleagues would be offered police protection, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We keep security under constant review but I'm not going to be commenting on specific arrangements for individuals."" In its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: ""We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June. ""Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening. ""They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way. ""Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area."" Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas. His father was a diplomat, who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984.

"Fans noticed a similarity between Costello's Pump It Up and Rodrigo's Brutal Elvis Costello has defended pop star Olivia Rodrigo after she was accused of lifting one of his guitar riffs.

But when a Twitter user said Rodrigo's song was ""pretty much a direct lift"",Costello replied,external: ""This is fine by me. ""It's how rock & roll works,"" he wrote. ""You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy."" He added: ""That's what I did."" The veteran singer-songwriter also included hashtags referencing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic Subterranean Homesick Blues, which inspired Pump It Up; and Chuck Berry's 1956 single Too Much Monkey Business, which influenced the Dylan song.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett and Becky Morton and edited by James Clarke. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close for the day shortly so here's a quick summary of the main stories today: The UK's travel lists are changing in the early hours of tomorrow, with a few more countries being added to the green list. Green list countries have the fewest restrictions, meaning no quarantine is needed when you return, but you will still need to take tests. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics will be going on the green list. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. However all these additions - apart from Malta - will also be onthe ""green watchlist"",external, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the green watchlist. And of course, just because they're on the UK's green list doesn't mean all obstacles are removed - that's just half the obstacle. Countries have their own rules for UK arrivals and Malta, for example, has just clamped down its restrictions and is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from tomorrow. Also overnight, some countries are being added to the UK's red list. Arrivals from there must pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The new red-list countries are: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda. More on the rules and the traffic light system here. British Athletics is investigating claims Scottish runner Andrew Butchart faked a Covid-19 test in order to return to the UK after an international event. The comments were allegedly made by Butchart in a podcast that was subsequently deleted. He was selected on Tuesday for Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics but British Athletics says that is under review. Butchart allegedly said he changed the date on an earlier PCR test after a delay in getting results back before his flight to the UK. However, in a statement released by his representative, Butchart says he has ""never falsified a PCR test"" and has ""always complied with the guidelines of the countries I have been travelling in"". ""The context of the podcast was about how hard it has been for athletes during the pandemic to travel and race. I perhaps glorified the situation for the podcast and I apologise if it came across the wrong way and or causes any offence to anyone,"" the statement says. Read more. The US airline United has confirmed it has placed its biggest aircraft order to date for 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (Â£21.6bn). It's a move that shows the airline is confident people will return to air travel once the pandemic is over. The order means the airline will replace its older, smaller jets between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom. United Airlines' boss Scott Kirby says the purchases will ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel"". Passengers who have been in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, China and Iran in the past 14 days still cannot enter the USunless a specific exemption applies,external, as a presidential decree introduced last March is still in place. Read the full story here. A Covid-19 vaccine refuser says he ""stared death in the eyes"" as he lay gasping for breath in hospital after catching the virus. Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two saysdeclining his vaccination invite in February has been ""the biggest mistake"" of his life. ""I was a bit reluctant and just thought I'll hold my horses and maybe get it later. I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30. What about hugging your friend when England score? According to the rules, people can use""personal judgement"",externalwith regards to close contact. Read more on how to watch within the rules here. The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic After Indiaâs devastating second Covid wave, the country is now grappling with tens of thousands of cases of a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two saysdeclining his vaccination invite in February has been ""the biggest mistake"" of his life. ""I was a bit reluctant and just thought I'll hold my horses and maybe get it later. I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30. What about hugging your friend when England score? According to the rules, people can use""personal judgement"",externalwith regards to close contact. Read more on how to watch within the rules here. The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A winner of one of Brewdog's ""solid gold"" beer cans has asked the advertising watchdog to investigate its claim the prize is worth Â£15,000. The Scottish firm offered 10 people the chance to find a gold can hidden in a case of its beer. Some winners questioned the worth after discovering the cans are gold plated, and one has asked the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to probe whether any rules were broken. Brewdog stands by the valuation. A company spokesperson said the use of the term ""solid gold"" was a mistake, but it stood by its Â£15,000 claim, saying the estimate was made up of more than just the metal used. The ASA confirmed it was looking into the matter after it was contacted by sales manager Adam Dean, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Mr Dean told the BBC: ""I realised I had won after I treated myself to a can after having mowed the lawn and spotted something glistening away in the case.

"The video footage from the incident on Sunday evening was shared online Police are investigating video footage which appears to show England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted by two men in a park. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""shocked at seeing the despicable harassment"" of Prof Whitty. The video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself. The Met Police said it happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday and all those involved had been spoken to. The force said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. It added that the incident has been recorded as a common assault and continues to be investigated. The PMtweeted:,external""I condemn the behaviour of these thugs. Our hard-working public servants should not have to face this kind of intimidation on our streets and we will not tolerate it."" Other MPs to criticise the incident included new Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it was ""appalling and totally unacceptable"". He added: ""The CMO (chief medical officer) works tirelessly on behalf of the country... the men behaving in this disgraceful way should be ashamed."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as ""disgusting behaviour"", adding that the police were right to investigate ""this harassment"". Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, tweeted: ""Even if you perceive it as non-violent, it is clear that he felt awful and uncomfortable and resisted. ""Public figures are not dolls, they are human beings, it is stunning how easily this is forgotten."" Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Professor Chris Whitty It is not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Is the answer to Prof Whitty's ordeal police protection? Certainly, if a senior cabinet minister was walking through St James's Park, they would have security watching their back. The word ""harassment"" doesn't convey how shocking the confrontation looks and how vulnerable Prof Whitty must have felt. Nor is it the first time he has been confronted by phone-wielding blokes. His colleague, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, was also accosted by an anti-vaccine activist in Whitehall last week. They are not politicians - they are officials leading efforts to fight a pandemic who have become public figures. So yes, perhaps protection is part of the answer. Westminster is sprinkled with police officers and they guard the gates of Parliament and No 10, but it rarely feels heavily policed unless there is a demonstration under way. Asked whether Prof Whitty and his colleagues would be offered police protection, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We keep security under constant review but I'm not going to be commenting on specific arrangements for individuals."" In its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: ""We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June. ""Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening. ""They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way. ""Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area."" Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas. His father was a diplomat, who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984.

"Plans had been in place for indoor hospitality in the Republic of Ireland to reopen on 5 July The Irish government is delaying the return of some indoor activities, including hospitality, over increasing cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant. Indoor hospitality was due to reopen on 5 July. When it reopens, it will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. The recommendation was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Irish cabinet met on Tuesday morning to consider the plans. Mr Martin said while there would be an increase in the number of people who could attend outdoor events and the number who can attend weddings would be increased to 50 as planned, ""the return to other indoor activities including hospitality will be delayed"". ""NPHET's clear advice based on the modelling it has done is that given the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the safest way to now proceed with the return of indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid infection,"" he said. ""Over the course of the coming weeks, the government will work urgently with the relevant sectors to agree a practical and workable approach. ""The simple truth is that we are in a race between the variants and the vaccines and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the vaccine wins."" This video can not be played 'Reopening on 5 July would carry a real risk' Mr Martin said he knew his announcement of the delay would be greeted with dismay and frustration. He said the tourism and hospitality sectors had borne a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic and in recognition of this additional supports would be provided in the coming weeks. The taoiseach gave no date for when indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants would resume. Restaurateurs and publicans expressed their anger and frustration at Mr Martin's comments. Cathal Doherty, who owns the Ballyliffin Townhouse Boutique Hotel in County Donegal, said many in the hospitality sector would view Tuesday's announcement as unworkable. ""We obviously have to wait for the full published guidance, but it will be interesting to see how they [the government] can even begin to possibly explain this,"" Mr Doherty said. ""It's beyond confusing, we just seem to be going backwards."" Mr Doherty believes for many small businesses across Ireland the delay for reopening will be seen as the ""final nail in the coffin"". ""If we [the hospitality sector] don't start getting a decent trade in summer then many small businesses are simply not going to make it until winter,"" he said. ""That is the hard truth, this has caused more challenges than solutions,"" he added. Martina Barrett has labelled the government's announcement as ""absolutely ridiculous"" Martina Barrett, who owns The Tavern in Portnoo, County Donegal, labelled the proposed rules as ""absolutely ridiculous"". Ms Barnett explained that many of her staff, who are in their early 20s, have not even received their first Covid-19 jab and questioned how her pub could operate. ""It's just impossible to police, and once again this decision has left us unclear as to what to do next,"" she explained. Labour leader Alan Kelly said the plan was ""bananas and discriminatory"". He said what the government is proposing was not enforceable and people under 30 were shocked that they had been ""jettisoned"". Social Democrats co-leader RÃ³isÃ­n Shortall also said the plans were unworkable and unenforceable. Independent TD Mattie McGrath called on the government to dispense with the services of NPHET. Irish ministers to meet early over restrictions Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was intended to agree a plan by 19 July in consultation with the hospitality industry to allow those who are vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 to use indoor hospitality. The Cabinet Covid Committee had a meeting which lasted until 01:00 local time on Tuesday. During the meeting, the NPHET gave some warnings to the Irish government on Monday, including a ""most pessimistic"" scenario of hundreds of thousands of cases between July and September and more than 2,000 deaths with Covid-19. Meanwhile, TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would now be offered to all age groups after beingpreviously limited to over-50s. The plans have been criticised by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which said it was ""astounded"" that indoor hospitality would face a further delay. In a statement, the group said it believed the policy was discriminatory and unworkable. ""Restaurant, pub and cafÃ© owners will now be placed in the unenviable, complex and difficult position of allowing vaccinated customers enter indoors and restricting non-vaccinated customers to outdoor dining,"" its chief executive Adrian Cummins said. ""Such a practice of refusing access to goods and services in currently illegal under equality acts."" He added that many people working in the hospitality sector were in the unvaccinated age groups, and could potentially be asked to refuse service to their peers.

"Foreign business leaders will no longer need to quarantine when arriving in England if their trip is likely to have a significant economic benefit to the UK, the government has announced. The exemption will be for arrivals from amber-list countries, and only given in exceptional circumstances, the Department for Business (BEIS) said. Some business groups and MPs expressed anger as it excludes smaller companies. But BEIS said it would balance economic interests with public safety. Some critics said it should include all business travel and key workers. Labour's Angela Rayner and Manchester's Labour Mayor, Andy Burnham, said it smacked of one rule for the rich and one for the rest. Craig Beaumont, for the Federation of Small Business, said: ""Small business owners and the self-employed often travel for their business, and it is wrong to declare this activity as of no significant economic benefit - and so outside of the government's plans. ""There should not be a fast lane of easements for big business while small firms are left behind."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Medium-sized enterprises will be the powerhouses of our economic recovery, so initiatives that effectively lower quarantine requirements for executives in large businesses seem arbitrary."" Mr Parikh stressed that it was ""vital that the government does not overlook the crucial importance of helping SME business leaders getting back up and running by focusing purely on multinationals"". UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls agreed, telling the BBC this exemption needed to be ""expanded for broader business travel, including hospitality workers abroad who are currently unable to return to the UK due to the cost and hassle of current quarantine requirements"". The plans follow disquiet at perceived double standards for influential guests and dignitaries after sponsors and officials from Uefa and Fifa were allowed into the UK for Euro 2020 without having to quarantine. The exemption is for executives wishing to travel to England to make a ""financial investment in a UK-based business"" or for ""establishing a new business within the UK"". BEIS said: ""This exemption is designed to enable activity that creates and preserves UK jobs and investment, while taking steps to ensure public health risks are minimised."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""Protecting public health is our number one priority and that's why those exemptions will only apply in truly exceptional circumstances."" Business leaders will not qualify for an exemption if the activities can be carried out remotely via telephone or email, or by another person. ""Routine meetings"" and ""speculative sales pitches"" will not qualify. ""Significant economic benefit"" is considered to be having a greater than 50% chance of creating or preserving at least 500 UK-based jobs, or creating a new UK business within two years, BEIS said. Ms Rayner said: ""It is the lowest-paid working people who have got our country through this crisis, risking their lives on the front line. ""Yet again it is one rule for those at the top and another for everyone else."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was the ""wrong move at the wrong time"". ""It can't be one rule for the rich and another for the rest,"" he added. What are the latest changes to the green list for holidays? Hong Kong bans flights from UK over Covid concerns Business leaders visiting England will need to take a Covid-19 test, take further tests on arrival and tell the government they intend to use the exemption, before getting a letter of confirmation. Bosses hoping to use the loophole to attend a routine board meeting will be disappointed, although a meeting to make a decision on whether to invest in a new UK division could be accepted. As with the quarantine exemption for seasonal workers, the business leaders will need to self-isolate whenever they are not conducting the exempt business activity. Travellers from red list countries are not exempt. Business leaders have been primarily carrying out activities remotely during much of the pandemic. But airlines have been pushing hard for restrictions to ease, because sales of business-class and first-class seats - which generate the biggest profits - have plunged as companies adopt remote working. A spokesperson from ABTA, the travel association, told the BBC that while this was a ""step forward"", the roles and activities involved were ""limited, and this will not be not be sufficient to bring about a meaningful recovery in business travel"". Matthew Fell, UK policy director for the CBI business lobby group, told the BBC the measure was a ""welcome step towards taking the pragmatic and truly risk-based approach needed for business travellers in the coming months"".

"Fans noticed a similarity between Costello's Pump It Up and Rodrigo's Brutal Elvis Costello has defended pop star Olivia Rodrigo after she was accused of lifting one of his guitar riffs. Brutal, a track on Rodrigo's number one album, is based around a punky chord sequence that also featured in Costello's 1978 hit Pump It Up. But when a Twitter user said Rodrigo's song was ""pretty much a direct lift"",Costello replied,external: ""This is fine by me. ""It's how rock & roll works,"" he wrote. ""You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy."" He added: ""That's what I did."" The veteran singer-songwriter also included hashtags referencing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic Subterranean Homesick Blues, which inspired Pump It Up; and Chuck Berry's 1956 single Too Much Monkey Business, which influenced the Dylan song. You can compare the Costello and Rodrigo tracks below. The guitar riff first appears 14 seconds into Brutal, and at 15 seconds in Pump It Up: Allow YouTube content?

Costello's relaxed reaction comes despite a surge in music copyright cases in recent years. Perhaps the most infamous case was over the hit song Blurred Lines - in which the family of Marvin Gaye accused Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams of plagiarising Gaye's song Got to Give It Up. The jury's controversial verdict found that Thicke and Williams had copied the ""vibe"" of Gaye's 1977 hit - rather than lifting a melody or chord sequence, which is usual bar for plagiarism. The unstoppable rise of Olivia Rodrigo Olivia Rodrigo makes UK chart history Marvin Gaye's family keeps $5m payout Since then, stars like Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry and Childish Gambino have all been sued for millions over similarities between their songs and earlier hits. Others have taken the precaution of crediting writers who might have a claim, even a tangential one, to protect themselves against legal action. Notably, Taylor Swift gave Right Said Fred a share of her song Look What You Made Me Do because her chorus melody followed a similar rhythmic pattern to their 1990s novelty hit I'm Too Sexy. Rodrigo and her co-writer Daniel Nigro have not done the same for Brutal - but it seems Costello is honoured, rather than annoyed, by the hat-tip. Costello previously gave permission for Pump It Up's riff to be sampled in Rogue Trader's 2005 dance hit Voodoo Child. Courtney Love has complained about similarities between Rodrigo and Hole artwork Meanwhile, Rodrigo has faced separate accusations of plagiarism from Courtney Love. Love highlighted similarities between the artwork for her band Hole's 1994 album Live Through This and the images used to promote Rodrigo's Sour Prom, a livestream concert taking place on Tuesday. Both images show a prom queen holding flowers while mascara streams down their faces. ""My [album] cover was my original idea,"" Love wrote on Facebook. ""A thing you maybe have to actually live life to acquire? ""I've informed her I await her flowers [and] note."" Love also shared the Sour Prom photo on Instagram with the caption: ""Spot the difference,"" eliciting a reply from Rodrigo. ""Love u and live through this sooooo much,"" the 18-year-old commented, to which Love replied: ""Olivia - you're welcome. My favourite florist is in Notting Hill, London! Dm me for deets!

"Most of the changes will take effect from 1 October Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont. The changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. Easter drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly. Most of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021. The 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period. Other measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. Cinemas will also be able to sell alcohol in NI for the first time It marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. Late night as MLAs debate plan to extend pub hours Longer pub opening times 'could cost police Â£7m' Easter 'could be overrun by alcohol' if laws change Meanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon. The amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called ""surrender principle"" affects the industry. The principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered. Licences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means thatevery supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else. Mr O'Toole said the review would be a ""first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone"". Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a ""a balanced piece of legislation"". She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need ""to modernise in 2021"". ""I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,"" she said. Cinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. It will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Michael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step. ""I think it will add to people's overall experience,"" he said. ""I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation."" Other changes in the bill include the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. The changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

"Plans had been in place for indoor hospitality in the Republic of Ireland to reopen on 5 July The Irish government is delaying the return of some indoor activities, including hospitality, over increasing cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant. Indoor hospitality was due to reopen on 5 July. When it reopens, it will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. The recommendation was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Irish cabinet met on Tuesday morning to consider the plans. Mr Martin said while there would be an increase in the number of people who could attend outdoor events and the number who can attend weddings would be increased to 50 as planned, ""the return to other indoor activities including hospitality will be delayed"". ""NPHET's clear advice based on the modelling it has done is that given the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the safest way to now proceed with the return of indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid infection,"" he said. ""Over the course of the coming weeks, the government will work urgently with the relevant sectors to agree a practical and workable approach. ""The simple truth is that we are in a race between the variants and the vaccines and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the vaccine wins."" This video can not be played 'Reopening on 5 July would carry a real risk' Mr Martin said he knew his announcement of the delay would be greeted with dismay and frustration. He said the tourism and hospitality sectors had borne a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic and in recognition of this additional supports would be provided in the coming weeks. The taoiseach gave no date for when indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants would resume. Restaurateurs and publicans expressed their anger and frustration at Mr Martin's comments. Cathal Doherty, who owns the Ballyliffin Townhouse Boutique Hotel in County Donegal, said many in the hospitality sector would view Tuesday's announcement as unworkable. ""We obviously have to wait for the full published guidance, but it will be interesting to see how they [the government] can even begin to possibly explain this,"" Mr Doherty said. ""It's beyond confusing, we just seem to be going backwards."" Mr Doherty believes for many small businesses across Ireland the delay for reopening will be seen as the ""final nail in the coffin"". ""If we [the hospitality sector] don't start getting a decent trade in summer then many small businesses are simply not going to make it until winter,"" he said. ""That is the hard truth, this has caused more challenges than solutions,"" he added. Martina Barrett has labelled the government's announcement as ""absolutely ridiculous"" Martina Barrett, who owns The Tavern in Portnoo, County Donegal, labelled the proposed rules as ""absolutely ridiculous"". Ms Barnett explained that many of her staff, who are in their early 20s, have not even received their first Covid-19 jab and questioned how her pub could operate. ""It's just impossible to police, and once again this decision has left us unclear as to what to do next,"" she explained. Labour leader Alan Kelly said the plan was ""bananas and discriminatory"". He said what the government is proposing was not enforceable and people under 30 were shocked that they had been ""jettisoned"". Social Democrats co-leader RÃ³isÃ­n Shortall also said the plans were unworkable and unenforceable. Independent TD Mattie McGrath called on the government to dispense with the services of NPHET. Irish ministers to meet early over restrictions Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was intended to agree a plan by 19 July in consultation with the hospitality industry to allow those who are vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 to use indoor hospitality. The Cabinet Covid Committee had a meeting which lasted until 01:00 local time on Tuesday. During the meeting, the NPHET gave some warnings to the Irish government on Monday, including a ""most pessimistic"" scenario of hundreds of thousands of cases between July and September and more than 2,000 deaths with Covid-19. Meanwhile, TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would now be offered to all age groups after beingpreviously limited to over-50s. The plans have been criticised by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which said it was ""astounded"" that indoor hospitality would face a further delay. In a statement, the group said it believed the policy was discriminatory and unworkable. ""Restaurant, pub and cafÃ© owners will now be placed in the unenviable, complex and difficult position of allowing vaccinated customers enter indoors and restricting non-vaccinated customers to outdoor dining,"" its chief executive Adrian Cummins said. ""Such a practice of refusing access to goods and services in currently illegal under equality acts."" He added that many people working in the hospitality sector were in the unvaccinated age groups, and could potentially be asked to refuse service to their peers. Outdoor hospitality in the Republic has been reopen since 7 June, with social distancing and restrictions on the number of people who can meet in place. In Northern Ireland,indoor hospitality reopened on 24 May, with restrictions in place on the number of people and households able to meet.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett and Becky Morton and edited by James Clarke. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close for the day shortly so here's a quick summary of the main stories today: The UK's travel lists are changing in the early hours of tomorrow, with a few more countries being added to the green list. Green list countries have the fewest restrictions, meaning no quarantine is needed when you return, but you will still need to take tests. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics will be going on the green list. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. However all these additions - apart from Malta - will also be onthe ""green watchlist"",external, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the green watchlist. And of course, just because they're on the UK's green list doesn't mean all obstacles are removed - that's just half the obstacle. Countries have their own rules for UK arrivals and Malta, for example, has just clamped down its restrictions and is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from tomorrow. Also overnight, some countries are being added to the UK's red list. Arrivals from there must pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The new red-list countries are: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda. More on the rules and the traffic light system here. British Athletics is investigating claims Scottish runner Andrew Butchart faked a Covid-19 test in order to return to the UK after an international event. The comments were allegedly made by Butchart in a podcast that was subsequently deleted. He was selected on Tuesday for Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics but British Athletics says that is under review. Butchart allegedly said he changed the date on an earlier PCR test after a delay in getting results back before his flight to the UK. However, in a statement released by his representative, Butchart says he has ""never falsified a PCR test"" and has ""always complied with the guidelines of the countries I have been travelling in"". ""The context of the podcast was about how hard it has been for athletes during the pandemic to travel and race. I perhaps glorified the situation for the podcast and I apologise if it came across the wrong way and or causes any offence to anyone,"" the statement says. Read more. The US airline United has confirmed it has placed its biggest aircraft order to date for 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (Â£21.6bn). It's a move that shows the airline is confident people will return to air travel once the pandemic is over. The order means the airline will replace its older, smaller jets between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom. United Airlines' boss Scott Kirby says the purchases will ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel"". Passengers who have been in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, China and Iran in the past 14 days still cannot enter the USunless a specific exemption applies,external, as a presidential decree introduced last March is still in place.

Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two saysdeclining his vaccination invite in February has been ""the biggest mistake"" of his life. ""I was a bit reluctant and just thought I'll hold my horses and maybe get it later. I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30. What about hugging your friend when England score? According to the rules, people can use""personal judgement"",externalwith regards to close contact. Read more on how to watch within the rules here. The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic After Indiaâs devastating second Covid wave, the country is now grappling with tens of thousands of cases of a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK house prices rose 13.4% in the year to June, the fastest pace since November 2004, the Nationwide has said. The building society said the average house price increased to Â£245,432 from Â£216,403 in June 2020. Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were ""close to a record high"" in relation to average incomes, which he added ""makes it even harder"" for first-time buyers. He told the BBC the pandemic had ""stimulated"" the housing market. Mr Gardner said lots of people had ""reassessed what they want from home"" in terms of space and where they live as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pandemic is an unusual kind of shock - it has stimulated housing market activity rather than the shock holding back the market which is normally what happens,"" he added. People moving home drive mortgage borrowing surge Banks call for support for struggling homeowners The Nationwide bases the findings on its own mortgage data. It said while the rapid annual growth was partly due to prices being ""unusually weak"" during the first lockdown last year, the market continued to ""show significant momentum"". All parts of the UK saw a rise in house prices in the second quarter of 2021, with Northern Ireland and Wales experiencing the largest year-on-year increases of 14% and 13.1% respectively. The slowest rate of price growth was seen in Scotland, where property values increased by 7.1%, while London was England's weakest performing region, with prices rising 7.3% Mr Gardner said despite the increase in house prices to ""new all-time highs"", the typical mortgage payment was ""not high by historic standards compared to take home pay, largely because mortgage rates remain close to all-time lows"". House prices are rising fast; prompted by stamp duty holidays, sustained by estate agent marketing, and - significantly - inspired by a Covid-related change of priorities among buyers. Of course, this is a general picture. The UK housing market is a series of mini-markets. Just ask someone trying to sell a flat at the moment and they may feel they are in a parallel universe. What really is in doubt is whether this boom will be followed by a bust. If the economy fails to recover and jobs are lost, some people may be forced to sell and fewer will want to buy. If that is sustained and prices fall, negative equity looms for new buyers who are borrowing heavily now to buy somewhere bigger in which to live and work. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic The market in recent months has continued to be stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From Thursday, those tax breaksstart to be withdrawn, and will return completely to the pre-pandemic levels by October. Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country, said: ""Annual house price growth of this magnitude is something no one thought they'd see, particularly with the stamp duty holiday now tapering out. ""The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all because other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates."" However, some analysts point to the link between housing demand and jobs as key to the future of property prices. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said unemployment would be closely watched. ""How many people will still be in a job once the furlough scheme ends? How many mortgage holidays will result in quick sales? There is no getting away from the fact that the next few months will be difficult for many people once support is withdrawn,"" she said.

"The UK needs to set a binding target for building battery factories and install millions more charging points for electric cars, the industry says. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says ambitious policies over the next decade could create up to 40,000 high-skilled jobs. But it warns failure to take action could be disastrous for the car sector. SMMT fears the potential loss of around 90,000 posts and worsening regional inequalities across the country. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that without the right backing, UK businesses would become ""consumers not producers, spectators not innovatorsâ¦ lead and we succeed, follow and we fail"". ""If ambitious words were currency, the UK would indeed be rich,"" he said. ""Give us the tools, and we will finish the job."" Later this week, Japanese manufacturer Nissan is expected to announce plans for a new so-called Gigafactory to build batteries at its manufacturing base in Sunderland. Mr Hawes said that under current plans the UK will have 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery production by 2025, whereas Germany will have 164GWh. The expected announcement from Nissan, he said, would be ""a real vote of confidenceâ¦ but we need a lot more than that"". Nissan investment to create thousands of UK jobs UK could be left behind in the electric car race What will happen to all the dead car batteries? A spokeswoman for the government said: ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and are dedicated to securing gigafactories to support the auto sector's transition to electric vehicles. ""We continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK."" She added that the UK already has more than 23,800 public charging points including 4,450 rapid devices - one of the largest networks of rapids in Europe. ""We are working closely with local authorities to rollout the electric vehicle revolution, with Â£1.3bn investment for electric vehicle infrastructure which will support drivers across the country,"" she said. A report, written for the SMMT by consultants Public First, sets out a range of proposals that it claims would secure the future competitiveness of the automotive industry - a sector which it claims contributes Â£15bn to the UK economy, and employs around 180,000 people. The shift to electrified vehicles, it says, is the biggest challenge facing the sector. The sale of new cars powered only by petrol and diesel is due to be outlawed by 2030 in the UK, while hybrids will be banned five years later. Other European governments have also set targets for phasing out conventional vehicles. Nissan is expected to announce a new gigafactory in the UK To meet demand for new electric cars, the report says, the government should commit to creating so-called gigafactories - giant battery-building plants - with a capacity of 60GWh by 2030. At the moment, the only British factory making the kind of batteries needed for electric cars on a large scale is Envision AESC's plant in Sunderland. It has an output of around 2GWh, and is used to provide power packs for the Nissan Leaf, which is also produced in the region. The Japanese carmaker is widely expected to announce later this week that it will expand this partnership, and invest heavily in a new gigafactory, which will initially have a capacity of at least 6.5GWh. Stellantis, the global car company which owns Vauxhall, is expected to announce within the next few weeks whether its plant at Ellesmere Port will have a long term future. It has been considering whether to build electric cars at the factory in Cheshire. Alison Jones, the UK managing director of Stellantis suggested a decision by the company about where it will build a new gigafactory in Europe was central to its discussions with the government about the plant's future, which she said were ""ongoing"". ""That's why it's so important for the government to make their statements and their actual investments in UK manufacturing manufacturing"", she said. Theinfluential green group Transport and Environment recently warnedthat even this would amount to ""a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe, for which funding has already been secured"". The group suggested that the UK risked being left behind as other countries invested more rapidly in electric car production. It also expressed doubts that a number of other projects, including start-up Britishvolt's ambitious plan for a 35GWh factory in Northumberland, would happen without more pressure from the industry itself. The SMMT's report, meanwhile, makes a number of other recommendations. It says there is a need for at least 2.3 million new charging points to be set up around the country by 2030. This would, it suggests ""ensure that all drivers - especially those without driveways - have the confidence to invest in the latest low emission technologies, investment that will not just support a healthy domestic market, but which will underpin mass market automotive manufacturing in the UK"". Power packs for the Nissan Leaf are currently produced in Sunderland It also calls for the introduction of a ""build back better fund"" from the government to support manufacturing jobs and reduce costs, a commitment to developing and deploying connected and automated vehicle technology and a review of taxes affecting the sector. The stakes, the SMMT says, are high. The correct strategy, it claims would see the sector transitioning to a zero emissions future, with ambitious global trading terms. This, it suggests, could create 40,000 well paid and highly skilled jobs by 2030 - and would have a significant impact in the car industry's traditional heartlands, such as the West Midlands and the North East. But without such a framework, it claims, the UK's automotive industry risks falling into a decline, resulting in the loss of some 90,000 jobs. The majority of them would be lost outside London and the South East, thereby increasing regional inequality.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett and Becky Morton and edited by James Clarke. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close for the day shortly so here's a quick summary of the main stories today: The UK's travel lists are changing in the early hours of tomorrow, with a few more countries being added to the green list. Green list countries have the fewest restrictions, meaning no quarantine is needed when you return, but you will still need to take tests. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics will be going on the green list. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. However all these additions - apart from Malta - will also be onthe ""green watchlist"",external, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the green watchlist. And of course, just because they're on the UK's green list doesn't mean all obstacles are removed - that's just half the obstacle. Countries have their own rules for UK arrivals and Malta, for example, has just clamped down its restrictions and is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from tomorrow. Also overnight, some countries are being added to the UK's red list. Arrivals from there must pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The new red-list countries are: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda. More on the rules and the traffic light system here. British Athletics is investigating claims Scottish runner Andrew Butchart faked a Covid-19 test in order to return to the UK after an international event. The comments were allegedly made by Butchart in a podcast that was subsequently deleted. He was selected on Tuesday for Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics but British Athletics says that is under review. Butchart allegedly said he changed the date on an earlier PCR test after a delay in getting results back before his flight to the UK. However, in a statement released by his representative, Butchart says he has ""never falsified a PCR test"" and has ""always complied with the guidelines of the countries I have been travelling in"". ""The context of the podcast was about how hard it has been for athletes during the pandemic to travel and race. I perhaps glorified the situation for the podcast and I apologise if it came across the wrong way and or causes any offence to anyone,"" the statement says. Read more. The US airline United has confirmed it has placed its biggest aircraft order to date for 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (Â£21.6bn). It's a move that shows the airline is confident people will return to air travel once the pandemic is over. The order means the airline will replace its older, smaller jets between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom. United Airlines' boss Scott Kirby says the purchases will ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel"".

I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30.

The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic After Indiaâs devastating second Covid wave, the country is now grappling with tens of thousands of cases of a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK needs to set a binding target for building battery factories and install millions more charging points for electric cars, the industry says. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says ambitious policies over the next decade could create up to 40,000 high-skilled jobs. But it warns failure to take action could be disastrous for the car sector. SMMT fears the potential loss of around 90,000 posts and worsening regional inequalities across the country. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that without the right backing, UK businesses would become ""consumers not producers, spectators not innovatorsâ¦ lead and we succeed, follow and we fail"". ""If ambitious words were currency, the UK would indeed be rich,"" he said. ""Give us the tools, and we will finish the job."" Later this week, Japanese manufacturer Nissan is expected to announce plans for a new so-called Gigafactory to build batteries at its manufacturing base in Sunderland. Mr Hawes said that under current plans the UK will have 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery production by 2025, whereas Germany will have 164GWh. The expected announcement from Nissan, he said, would be ""a real vote of confidenceâ¦ but we need a lot more than that"". Nissan investment to create thousands of UK jobs UK could be left behind in the electric car race What will happen to all the dead car batteries? A spokeswoman for the government said: ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and are dedicated to securing gigafactories to support the auto sector's transition to electric vehicles. ""We continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK."" She added that the UK already has more than 23,800 public charging points including 4,450 rapid devices - one of the largest networks of rapids in Europe. ""We are working closely with local authorities to rollout the electric vehicle revolution, with Â£1.3bn investment for electric vehicle infrastructure which will support drivers across the country,"" she said. A report, written for the SMMT by consultants Public First, sets out a range of proposals that it claims would secure the future competitiveness of the automotive industry - a sector which it claims contributes Â£15bn to the UK economy, and employs around 180,000 people. The shift to electrified vehicles, it says, is the biggest challenge facing the sector. The sale of new cars powered only by petrol and diesel is due to be outlawed by 2030 in the UK, while hybrids will be banned five years later. Other European governments have also set targets for phasing out conventional vehicles. Nissan is expected to announce a new gigafactory in the UK To meet demand for new electric cars, the report says, the government should commit to creating so-called gigafactories - giant battery-building plants - with a capacity of 60GWh by 2030. At the moment, the only British factory making the kind of batteries needed for electric cars on a large scale is Envision AESC's plant in Sunderland. It has an output of around 2GWh, and is used to provide power packs for the Nissan Leaf, which is also produced in the region. The Japanese carmaker is widely expected to announce later this week that it will expand this partnership, and invest heavily in a new gigafactory, which will initially have a capacity of at least 6.5GWh. Stellantis, the global car company which owns Vauxhall, is expected to announce within the next few weeks whether its plant at Ellesmere Port will have a long term future. It has been considering whether to build electric cars at the factory in Cheshire. Alison Jones, the UK managing director of Stellantis suggested a decision by the company about where it will build a new gigafactory in Europe was central to its discussions with the government about the plant's future, which she said were ""ongoing"". ""That's why it's so important for the government to make their statements and their actual investments in UK manufacturing manufacturing"", she said. Theinfluential green group Transport and Environment recently warnedthat even this would amount to ""a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe, for which funding has already been secured"". The group suggested that the UK risked being left behind as other countries invested more rapidly in electric car production. It also expressed doubts that a number of other projects, including start-up Britishvolt's ambitious plan for a 35GWh factory in Northumberland, would happen without more pressure from the industry itself. The SMMT's report, meanwhile, makes a number of other recommendations. It says there is a need for at least 2.3 million new charging points to be set up around the country by 2030. This would, it suggests ""ensure that all drivers - especially those without driveways - have the confidence to invest in the latest low emission technologies, investment that will not just support a healthy domestic market, but which will underpin mass market automotive manufacturing in the UK"". Power packs for the Nissan Leaf are currently produced in Sunderland It also calls for the introduction of a ""build back better fund"" from the government to support manufacturing jobs and reduce costs, a commitment to developing and deploying connected and automated vehicle technology and a review of taxes affecting the sector. The stakes, the SMMT says, are high. The correct strategy, it claims would see the sector transitioning to a zero emissions future, with ambitious global trading terms. This, it suggests, could create 40,000 well paid and highly skilled jobs by 2030 - and would have a significant impact in the car industry's traditional heartlands, such as the West Midlands and the North East. But without such a framework, it claims, the UK's automotive industry risks falling into a decline, resulting in the loss of some 90,000 jobs. The majority of them would be lost outside London and the South East, thereby increasing regional inequality.

The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fans noticed a similarity between Costello's Pump It Up and Rodrigo's Brutal Elvis Costello has defended pop star Olivia Rodrigo after she was accused of lifting one of his guitar riffs. Brutal, a track on Rodrigo's number one album, is based around a punky chord sequence that also featured in Costello's 1978 hit Pump It Up. But when a Twitter user said Rodrigo's song was ""pretty much a direct lift"",Costello replied,external: ""This is fine by me. ""It's how rock & roll works,"" he wrote. ""You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy."" He added: ""That's what I did."" The veteran singer-songwriter also included hashtags referencing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic Subterranean Homesick Blues, which inspired Pump It Up; and Chuck Berry's 1956 single Too Much Monkey Business, which influenced the Dylan song. You can compare the Costello and Rodrigo tracks below. The guitar riff first appears 14 seconds into Brutal, and at 15 seconds in Pump It Up: Allow YouTube content?

Costello's relaxed reaction comes despite a surge in music copyright cases in recent years. Perhaps the most infamous case was over the hit song Blurred Lines - in which the family of Marvin Gaye accused Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams of plagiarising Gaye's song Got to Give It Up. The jury's controversial verdict found that Thicke and Williams had copied the ""vibe"" of Gaye's 1977 hit - rather than lifting a melody or chord sequence, which is usual bar for plagiarism. The unstoppable rise of Olivia Rodrigo Olivia Rodrigo makes UK chart history Marvin Gaye's family keeps $5m payout Since then, stars like Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry and Childish Gambino have all been sued for millions over similarities between their songs and earlier hits. Others have taken the precaution of crediting writers who might have a claim, even a tangential one, to protect themselves against legal action. Notably, Taylor Swift gave Right Said Fred a share of her song Look What You Made Me Do because her chorus melody followed a similar rhythmic pattern to their 1990s novelty hit I'm Too Sexy. Rodrigo and her co-writer Daniel Nigro have not done the same for Brutal - but it seems Costello is honoured, rather than annoyed, by the hat-tip. Costello previously gave permission for Pump It Up's riff to be sampled in Rogue Trader's 2005 dance hit Voodoo Child. Courtney Love has complained about similarities between Rodrigo and Hole artwork Meanwhile, Rodrigo has faced separate accusations of plagiarism from Courtney Love. Love highlighted similarities between the artwork for her band Hole's 1994 album Live Through This and the images used to promote Rodrigo's Sour Prom, a livestream concert taking place on Tuesday. Both images show a prom queen holding flowers while mascara streams down their faces. ""My [album] cover was my original idea,"" Love wrote on Facebook. ""A thing you maybe have to actually live life to acquire? ""I've informed her I await her flowers [and] note."" Love also shared the Sour Prom photo on Instagram with the caption: ""Spot the difference,"" eliciting a reply from Rodrigo.

"This video can not be played ""I couldn't put my finger on the reason for feeling the way I did"" Adopted children and young people in Wales are facing a ""mental health emergency,"" a charity has warned. Adoption UK said two-thirds of adoptive families surveyed in Wales ""face a continual struggle for support"". Mimi Woods, 20, from Carmarthenshire, tried to take her own life as a teenager after being adopted aged three. She is calling for more support for people who have been adopted. The Welsh government acknowledged ""there is more to do"". Adoption UK surveyed adoptive families across the UK, including 335 from Wales, representing 351 children. Adoption: 'One boy stood out to me - he's now my son' 'Birth family turned our adopted sons against us' How has adoption changed in the pandemic? In a new report, the charity said the ""mental health emergency"" among adopted children and young people had been caused by ""failings in a system that is not set up to meet their needs"". The report found most adopted young people suffered abuse, neglect or violence in their early years which had lasting impacts on their relationships, learning and health. It said adoptive families were left to ""pick up the pieces"" when professional support was not provided. Mimi Woods tried to take her own life as a teenager after being adopted aged three As a teenager, Mimi Woods could not understand why she struggled with her mental health. She was thriving in school and had a loving family. But at just 15 years old, she tried to take her own life. Reflecting now, Mimi realised a lot of the problems stemmed from being adopted and the trauma she would have suffered as a baby taken into care. Born in Bangkok, Mimi lived in foster care and a children's home in Thailand before she was adopted as and moved to Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. ""It comes from a feeling of not being wanted and not having a place or an emotional connection to anyone,"" she said. Mimi Woods says her adoptive parents Lynne and Gareth Woods have always been loving and supportive She does not remember living in Thailand but said that being adopted had emotional consequences for her as a teenager, including ""feeling lost within myself"". ""I had no motivation and it felt as though there was no light at the end of the tunnel. ""When I was in secondary school, I felt like I didn't know who I was. I've been trying to find myself but I'm still looking now, aged 20. ""Identity is a big issue for me. I was adopted from Thailand, so everyone could tell I was adopted as my adoptive parents are white. ""My parents are lovely people and I had a really happy childhood and had no other issues in my life, so I couldn't put my finger on the reason for feeling the way I did. ""I've since learned that past trauma can affect you years later."" Mimi was adopted and moved to Carmarthenshire from Thailand when she was three Mimi is involved in a group for young people who have been adopted and suffered with depression, trauma and suicidal thoughts. She said speaking to other adopted people had really helped. ""My mental health is now better than what it was last year but I do still get those days where I cry a lot, overthink things and have no motivation."" Families are ""being failed by the system,"" says Ann Bell, director of Adoption UK in Wales Ann Bell, director of Adoption UK in Wales, said: ""For the third year running, two-thirds of respondents from Wales said they face a continual struggle for support. ""All too often, these families are being failed by a system which invests heavily in the placement of children for adoption, then fades into the background, often with terrible consequences for the mental health of the children and their adoptive families."" She said the survey highlights the consequences of the failure to provide early and consistent support for adopted young people. The report found almost a quarter of adopted 16 to 25-year-olds in Wales were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2020 - more than twice as likely as UK averages. It also said that involvement in high risk and criminal activity had also steadily increased since its first Adoption Barometer report in 2019. Problems were often compounded by children falling through the cracks between child and adult services, and almost three-quarters of parents who responded said their child's support reduced or stopped as the became too old to use adolescent services. Another concern was the impact that contacting birth families can have when it was done outside any formal agreement. The charity said it could have ""devastating effects"" on family stability and mental health. As of 31 March 2020, there were 7,170 children in care in Wales - an increase of 5% compared with the previous year. Of those, 245 (3%) were placed for adoption and 295 were adopted from care. When families did get support, the report found there was a noticeable improvement despite the pandemic. Ms Bell said investment from the Welsh Government had improved some aspects of adoption services, but that more needed to be done. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it ""welcomed"" the report's findings because ""the voices of children, young people and adoptive families are key to ensuring the right support is provided"". The spokesperson said it had ""invested substantially"" in the Welsh adoption service, but conceded ""there is more to do and we will continue working with the sector to ensure we target those areas"". The government is also ""committed to improving mental health services"" and will continue to ""develop our services so adopted young people making the transition to adulthood"", the spokesperson added. Suzanne Griffiths, director of the National Adoption Service for Wales, said it was important to ""recognise and celebrate the improvement that has already taken place"", but added the service was ""not complacent about the need for continued improvement"".

"The UK needs to set a binding target for building battery factories and install millions more charging points for electric cars, the industry says. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says ambitious policies over the next decade could create up to 40,000 high-skilled jobs. But it warns failure to take action could be disastrous for the car sector. SMMT fears the potential loss of around 90,000 posts and worsening regional inequalities across the country. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that without the right backing, UK businesses would become ""consumers not producers, spectators not innovatorsâ¦ lead and we succeed, follow and we fail"". ""If ambitious words were currency, the UK would indeed be rich,"" he said. ""Give us the tools, and we will finish the job."" Later this week, Japanese manufacturer Nissan is expected to announce plans for a new so-called Gigafactory to build batteries at its manufacturing base in Sunderland. Mr Hawes said that under current plans the UK will have 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery production by 2025, whereas Germany will have 164GWh. The expected announcement from Nissan, he said, would be ""a real vote of confidenceâ¦ but we need a lot more than that"". Nissan investment to create thousands of UK jobs UK could be left behind in the electric car race What will happen to all the dead car batteries? A spokeswoman for the government said: ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and are dedicated to securing gigafactories to support the auto sector's transition to electric vehicles. ""We continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK."" She added that the UK already has more than 23,800 public charging points including 4,450 rapid devices - one of the largest networks of rapids in Europe. ""We are working closely with local authorities to rollout the electric vehicle revolution, with Â£1.3bn investment for electric vehicle infrastructure which will support drivers across the country,"" she said. A report, written for the SMMT by consultants Public First, sets out a range of proposals that it claims would secure the future competitiveness of the automotive industry - a sector which it claims contributes Â£15bn to the UK economy, and employs around 180,000 people. The shift to electrified vehicles, it says, is the biggest challenge facing the sector. The sale of new cars powered only by petrol and diesel is due to be outlawed by 2030 in the UK, while hybrids will be banned five years later. Other European governments have also set targets for phasing out conventional vehicles. Nissan is expected to announce a new gigafactory in the UK To meet demand for new electric cars, the report says, the government should commit to creating so-called gigafactories - giant battery-building plants - with a capacity of 60GWh by 2030. At the moment, the only British factory making the kind of batteries needed for electric cars on a large scale is Envision AESC's plant in Sunderland. It has an output of around 2GWh, and is used to provide power packs for the Nissan Leaf, which is also produced in the region. The Japanese carmaker is widely expected to announce later this week that it will expand this partnership, and invest heavily in a new gigafactory, which will initially have a capacity of at least 6.5GWh. Stellantis, the global car company which owns Vauxhall, is expected to announce within the next few weeks whether its plant at Ellesmere Port will have a long term future. It has been considering whether to build electric cars at the factory in Cheshire. Alison Jones, the UK managing director of Stellantis suggested a decision by the company about where it will build a new gigafactory in Europe was central to its discussions with the government about the plant's future, which she said were ""ongoing"". ""That's why it's so important for the government to make their statements and their actual investments in UK manufacturing manufacturing"", she said. Theinfluential green group Transport and Environment recently warnedthat even this would amount to ""a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe, for which funding has already been secured"". The group suggested that the UK risked being left behind as other countries invested more rapidly in electric car production. It also expressed doubts that a number of other projects, including start-up Britishvolt's ambitious plan for a 35GWh factory in Northumberland, would happen without more pressure from the industry itself. The SMMT's report, meanwhile, makes a number of other recommendations. It says there is a need for at least 2.3 million new charging points to be set up around the country by 2030. This would, it suggests ""ensure that all drivers - especially those without driveways - have the confidence to invest in the latest low emission technologies, investment that will not just support a healthy domestic market, but which will underpin mass market automotive manufacturing in the UK"". Power packs for the Nissan Leaf are currently produced in Sunderland It also calls for the introduction of a ""build back better fund"" from the government to support manufacturing jobs and reduce costs, a commitment to developing and deploying connected and automated vehicle technology and a review of taxes affecting the sector. The stakes, the SMMT says, are high. The correct strategy, it claims would see the sector transitioning to a zero emissions future, with ambitious global trading terms. This, it suggests, could create 40,000 well paid and highly skilled jobs by 2030 - and would have a significant impact in the car industry's traditional heartlands, such as the West Midlands and the North East. But without such a framework, it claims, the UK's automotive industry risks falling into a decline, resulting in the loss of some 90,000 jobs. The majority of them would be lost outside London and the South East, thereby increasing regional inequality.

"UK house prices rose 13.4% in the year to June, the fastest pace since November 2004, the Nationwide has said. The building society said the average house price increased to Â£245,432 from Â£216,403 in June 2020. Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were ""close to a record high"" in relation to average incomes, which he added ""makes it even harder"" for first-time buyers. He told the BBC the pandemic had ""stimulated"" the housing market. Mr Gardner said lots of people had ""reassessed what they want from home"" in terms of space and where they live as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pandemic is an unusual kind of shock - it has stimulated housing market activity rather than the shock holding back the market which is normally what happens,"" he added. People moving home drive mortgage borrowing surge Banks call for support for struggling homeowners The Nationwide bases the findings on its own mortgage data. It said while the rapid annual growth was partly due to prices being ""unusually weak"" during the first lockdown last year, the market continued to ""show significant momentum"". All parts of the UK saw a rise in house prices in the second quarter of 2021, with Northern Ireland and Wales experiencing the largest year-on-year increases of 14% and 13.1% respectively. The slowest rate of price growth was seen in Scotland, where property values increased by 7.1%, while London was England's weakest performing region, with prices rising 7.3% Mr Gardner said despite the increase in house prices to ""new all-time highs"", the typical mortgage payment was ""not high by historic standards compared to take home pay, largely because mortgage rates remain close to all-time lows"". House prices are rising fast; prompted by stamp duty holidays, sustained by estate agent marketing, and - significantly - inspired by a Covid-related change of priorities among buyers. Of course, this is a general picture. The UK housing market is a series of mini-markets. Just ask someone trying to sell a flat at the moment and they may feel they are in a parallel universe. What really is in doubt is whether this boom will be followed by a bust. If the economy fails to recover and jobs are lost, some people may be forced to sell and fewer will want to buy. If that is sustained and prices fall, negative equity looms for new buyers who are borrowing heavily now to buy somewhere bigger in which to live and work. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic The market in recent months has continued to be stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From Thursday, those tax breaksstart to be withdrawn, and will return completely to the pre-pandemic levels by October. Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country, said: ""Annual house price growth of this magnitude is something no one thought they'd see, particularly with the stamp duty holiday now tapering out. ""The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all because other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates."" However, some analysts point to the link between housing demand and jobs as key to the future of property prices. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said unemployment would be closely watched. ""How many people will still be in a job once the furlough scheme ends? How many mortgage holidays will result in quick sales? There is no getting away from the fact that the next few months will be difficult for many people once support is withdrawn,"" she said.

"Allowing double-jabbed travellers arriving in the UK to avoid quarantine is a ""complicated"" policy, Grant Shapps tells MPs The government plans to introduce the change for fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries, such as Spain and France Former schools catch up tsar Sir Kevan Collins, tells MPs more vulnerable pupils have had a ""very difficult time"" during the pandemic Sir Kevan, who quit over a lack of funding for pandemic recovery plans. says extending the school day would tackle inequality Schools minister Nick Gibb says regular tests of children in contact with those who have tested positive could replace isolation Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions in Scotland on 19 July and 9 August Police are investigating a video showing England's chief minister Prof Chris Whitty being accosted by two men in a park The quality of face masks healthcare workers wear makes a huge difference to their risk of Covid infection, a study finds Restrictions have returned in parts of Australia due to a rise in cases of the more infectious variant Edited by James Clarke That's it from us today. We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett and Becky Morton and edited by James Clarke. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close for the day shortly so here's a quick summary of the main stories today: The UK's travel lists are changing in the early hours of tomorrow, with a few more countries being added to the green list. Green list countries have the fewest restrictions, meaning no quarantine is needed when you return, but you will still need to take tests. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics will be going on the green list. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. However all these additions - apart from Malta - will also be onthe ""green watchlist"",external, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the green watchlist. And of course, just because they're on the UK's green list doesn't mean all obstacles are removed - that's just half the obstacle. Countries have their own rules for UK arrivals and Malta, for example, has just clamped down its restrictions and is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from tomorrow. Also overnight, some countries are being added to the UK's red list. Arrivals from there must pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The new red-list countries are: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda. More on the rules and the traffic light system here. British Athletics is investigating claims Scottish runner Andrew Butchart faked a Covid-19 test in order to return to the UK after an international event. The comments were allegedly made by Butchart in a podcast that was subsequently deleted. He was selected on Tuesday for Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics but British Athletics says that is under review. Butchart allegedly said he changed the date on an earlier PCR test after a delay in getting results back before his flight to the UK. However, in a statement released by his representative, Butchart says he has ""never falsified a PCR test"" and has ""always complied with the guidelines of the countries I have been travelling in"". ""The context of the podcast was about how hard it has been for athletes during the pandemic to travel and race. I perhaps glorified the situation for the podcast and I apologise if it came across the wrong way and or causes any offence to anyone,"" the statement says. Read more. The US airline United has confirmed it has placed its biggest aircraft order to date for 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (Â£21.6bn). It's a move that shows the airline is confident people will return to air travel once the pandemic is over. The order means the airline will replace its older, smaller jets between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom. United Airlines' boss Scott Kirby says the purchases will ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel"". Passengers who have been in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, China and Iran in the past 14 days still cannot enter the USunless a specific exemption applies,external, as a presidential decree introduced last March is still in place.

Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two saysdeclining his vaccination invite in February has been ""the biggest mistake"" of his life. ""I was a bit reluctant and just thought I'll hold my horses and maybe get it later. I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30. What about hugging your friend when England score? According to the rules, people can use""personal judgement"",externalwith regards to close contact. Read more on how to watch within the rules here. The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic After Indiaâs devastating second Covid wave, the country is now grappling with tens of thousands of cases of a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett and Becky Morton and edited by James Clarke. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close for the day shortly so here's a quick summary of the main stories today: The UK's travel lists are changing in the early hours of tomorrow, with a few more countries being added to the green list. Green list countries have the fewest restrictions, meaning no quarantine is needed when you return, but you will still need to take tests. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday, Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics will be going on the green list. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. However all these additions - apart from Malta - will also be onthe ""green watchlist"",external, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the green watchlist. And of course, just because they're on the UK's green list doesn't mean all obstacles are removed - that's just half the obstacle. Countries have their own rules for UK arrivals and Malta, for example, has just clamped down its restrictions and is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from tomorrow. Also overnight, some countries are being added to the UK's red list. Arrivals from there must pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. The new red-list countries are: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda. More on the rules and the traffic light system here. British Athletics is investigating claims Scottish runner Andrew Butchart faked a Covid-19 test in order to return to the UK after an international event. The comments were allegedly made by Butchart in a podcast that was subsequently deleted. He was selected on Tuesday for Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics but British Athletics says that is under review. Butchart allegedly said he changed the date on an earlier PCR test after a delay in getting results back before his flight to the UK. However, in a statement released by his representative, Butchart says he has ""never falsified a PCR test"" and has ""always complied with the guidelines of the countries I have been travelling in"". ""The context of the podcast was about how hard it has been for athletes during the pandemic to travel and race. I perhaps glorified the situation for the podcast and I apologise if it came across the wrong way and or causes any offence to anyone,"" the statement says. Read more. The US airline United has confirmed it has placed its biggest aircraft order to date for 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (Â£21.6bn). It's a move that shows the airline is confident people will return to air travel once the pandemic is over. The order means the airline will replace its older, smaller jets between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom. United Airlines' boss Scott Kirby says the purchases will ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel"". Passengers who have been in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, China and Iran in the past 14 days still cannot enter the USunless a specific exemption applies,external, as a presidential decree introduced last March is still in place.

Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two saysdeclining his vaccination invite in February has been ""the biggest mistake"" of his life. ""I was a bit reluctant and just thought I'll hold my horses and maybe get it later. I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill. I know differently now,"" he says. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and is urging others to get vaccinated. ""I will never forget when the paramedics were taking me down the stairs and my kids were crying and looking at me,"" he says. He spent nine days in hospital after becoming ill two weeks ago, and expects to be recovering for many weeks to come. This video can not be played Covid: 'Australia vaccine rollout is stunning failure' Australia is currently seeing a spike in cases in multiple parts of the country - the first time this has happened in months. Throughout the pandemic, the country has managed to keep case numbers low with strict border closures and lockdowns. But Prof Tim Soutphommasane from Sydney University says Australia is lagging way behind other developed countries with the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine - and that it will be looked back on as a ""stunning failure"". ""Australia has been winning the war but it is at serious risk of losing the peace because other countries around the world are rapidly opening up with very well vaccinated populations, leaving Australia behind,"" he says. It is ""impractical and unfair"" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says. Education Minister Jeremy Miles yesterday saidrules would be ""localised"" within a national framework, with individual schools, colleges and universities deciding their own rules in the future, to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils are not having to self-isolate. This would include measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing. But Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, says teachers need to be left to focus on pupils' education. Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education. Read more. Sandro VetskoBBC Monitoring Authorities in Moscow have vowed to prosecute people issuing fake passes to the city's bars and restaurants that are only allowing in vaccinated and Covid-free customers. Under rules that came into force in Moscow yesterday amid an
explosive rise in coronavirus infections only people with a QR code that
can be obtained after being vaccinated, tested negative or having antibodies
are allowed indoors at Moscowâs bars and restaurants. âThose who organise companies of this kind to issue fake
certificates and QR codes will indeed be subjected to criminal accountability,â
the head of Moscow city governmentâs trade and services department, Alexei
Nemeryuk says. âThere have been more than 15 cases in the past two weeks
where organisations and people engaged in this have been identified. Criminal
accountability awaits them,â he said earlier today in remarks reported by state news agency
RIA Novosti. MP Alexander Khinshteyn has told Rossiya 24 news channel the scale of the problem is âvery bigâ. âFirst criminal casesâ have already been launched, he says.
Alleged wrongdoers include âturncoats in white lab coatsâ, Khinshteyn says, referring to health care workers. We've heard a lot of warnings about how cancer treatment has been impacted by the pandemic. Now, NHS Scotland has released new figures showing the number of people being diagnosed and starting cancer treatment last year dropped by more than 4,000. It found 83% of patients started treatment within the 62-day standard time from the day the patient was given an urgent referral. From early March last year, as the pandemic hit the UK, the three screening programmes for cancer were paused, with no new invitations sent out. The numbers of eligible referrals for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer decreased substantially when compared with the average. Read the full story here. There's about half an hour to go until England face Germany - with a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals at stake. About 43,000 fans are expected at Wembley Stadium - around 50% of full capacity - and 1,800 of them are Germany supporters. But if you're not one of the lucky ones with tickets, the next option might be at the pub - but Covid means there are some extra rules in place. Pubs have beentold to risk-assess,externalwhere TV screens are, and the volume, when making venues Covid-secure. And in England, the rules are still that up to six people from six households, or two households of any size, can meet in a pub. If you're in a pub garden, that number increases to 30. What about hugging your friend when England score? According to the rules, people can use""personal judgement"",externalwith regards to close contact. Read more on how to watch within the rules here. The Delta variant of coronavirus now accounts for 56% of new cases in Portugal, up from 4% a month ago, according to the National Health Institute. There has been a ""rampant increase"" in the prevalence of the variant, which was first identified in India, and it is set to become the dominant variant in all regions of Portugal within weeks, a report says. Although the Delta variant has accounted for the majority of
new cases in the Lisbon region for several weeks, that is not the case
everywhere - with a prevalence of 32% in the north region, against 94% in the
Alentejo, in the south. Last Friday, Germany put Portugal on its list of ""virus-variant areas"" meaning that, from today, anyone arriving from the country faces quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Earlier this month, the UK also increased restrictions on travel from Portugal, moving the country to itsamber list. This means people should not go on holiday there and those arriving back in the UK from Portugal must isolate for 10 days. More than 44.5 million people in the UK have now had one dose of a
coronavirus vaccine, while more than 32.7 million people have had two doses. It means 84.6% of the adult population have had at least one dose
and 62.1% are fully vaccinated. And more than 77 million vaccinations have been given in total. The UK has today recorded 20,479 new coronavirus cases, along with
23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic After Indiaâs devastating second Covid wave, the country is now grappling with tens of thousands of cases of a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The disease has been declared an epidemic in the nation. Thousands have died of it. Doctors say Covid, and the treatment being given for it, has led to this surge. The BBCâs Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in one of the worst affected districts. One of our top stories today has been the impact of Covid on schoolchildren, as new figures show there's been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England. The current rules are that groups - or ""bubbles"" - of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, althoughministers are considering whether this system can be replaced in the autumn. One pupil's father at a high school in Hexham in Northumberland has now removed his son from school entirely to avoid him having to self-isolate if a classmate tests positive. The father, who we're not naming to protect the identity of his son, says staying at home to avoid potential isolation is better for his son's mental health. ""We chose to do this as it is in the best interest of our son who can still learn remotely and, in addition, is still able to go out, for example to sports clubs,"" he says. He says the school refused to facilitate remote learning and told him it would take action if the absence continued. The school says it is following government guidance. Read the full story here. Senior executives arriving from abroadwill be able to leave quarantine in Englandif it is determined they are undertaking business activity that will bring ""significant economic benefit"" to the country. The government stresses this type of exemption for those arriving from an amber listed country will only be given in exceptional circumstances. Any UK firm set to benefit from the activity must employ at least 500 people and the work carried out by one of these executives is expected to preserve or create more than 500 jobs. These executives will still need to comply with public health measures, including being tested for the virus before they arrive and self-isolating whenever they are not performing the exempt activity. This exemption does not apply to travellers from red list countries. You can find a reminder of the travel ruleshere. Health Minister Lord Bethell has said it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email addresses under government guidelines. According to a report in the Sunday Times,external, a senior official
in the Department of Health says Lord Bethell âroutinely uses his private
inboxâ and concerns have been raised that some ministers could be using private email accounts for government business, including to discuss Covid contracts. However, Lord Bethell says he does not ""recognise
the substance of those commentsâ. He's told the Lords: ""The
guidelines are clear - it is not wrong for ministers to have personal email
addresses and I have corresponded with a very large number of members in this
chamber from both my parliamentary address and from my personal address and
that is right and I will continue to do so. ""In their enthusiasm, third parties often seek to
engage ministers through whatever means they can find and that includes their
personal email. That is not the same as using a personal email for formal
departmental decision-making."" He says contracts are negotiated by officials, not ministers, and submissions from officials are handled through departmental digital inboxes. ""Official
decisions are communicated through secure governmental infrastructure,"" he adds. Ministers agreed at a Cabinet meeting ""we will be able to live with Covid in the future"" once at the final stage of the roadmap due to the vaccine rollout, Downing Street says. A readout from the meeting says the government is ""increasingly confident"" of taking the final step out of restrictions on 19 July - with hospitalisations and deaths showing ""much shallower growth"" than cases. The health secretary has told the Cabinet the UK vaccine rollout has so far saved 27,000 lives, with 84% of adults having received a first dose and 61% both doses. Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman says the government will continue to publish daily coronavirus figures once restrictions have been lifted as they provide an ""important level of transparency to the public"". Nicola Sturgeon says she remains hopeful she can continue lifting restrictions on 19 July and 9 August but says how safely we get there depends on what we do now. She says this is a ""critical moment"" and we require care and vigilance over the next few weeks. The first minister says while we are vaccinating as quickly as we can, many people remain unprotected, including many young people who can be affected by long covid. She acknowledges people will be ""sick"" of this but says ""we are so close now"" and urges people to redouble their efforts for a few more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Andy Murray through to second round after beating Nikoloz Basilashvili Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Andy Murray recomposed himself to ensure his Wimbledon singles return ended with a dramatic four-set victory over 24th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili. In his first singles match in SW19 since 2017, the two-time champion led 6-4 6-3 5-0 against the Georgian. The Briton could not convert two match points and wobbled as Basilashvili, 29, fought back to force a fourth set. After a break to shut the Centre Court roof, Murray returned reinvigorated to win 6-4 6-3 5-7 6-3 under the lights. There was still more tension at the end of the fourth set, though. Murray was unable to take a third match point when Basilashvili nailed a forehand winner down the line, but clinched victory with the fourth when his opponent hit into the net. The majority of the home fans leapt to their feet, with a relieved Murray coolly raising his arms in the air before launching into a more manic leap moments later. ""I was really disappointed I had lost the third set and had to remember what I was doing to get into the winning position. I managed to turn it back around,"" said Murray, who is now ranked 118th in the world. The Scot will have a day off playing before his second-round match on Wednesday, knowing he will play a qualifier as Germany's Oscar Otte or France's Arthur Rinderknech await him. The pair saw their match suspended at 21:00 BST because of darkness - with the deciding set delicately poised at 9-9. Murray thought he would have to retire in 2019 before surgery which involved having metal put into his hip resurrected his career When Murray limped off Centre Court following his 2017 quarter-final defeat by American Sam Querrey, few would have predicted the 2013 and 2016 champion would not play in the singles again until four years later. That has been a combination of the injury problems which led to him contemplating retirement and the championships being postponed last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. While it was not quite like the heady days of old on Centre Court, 34-year-old Murray did offer a reminder to those 7,500 allowed in - and those many more watching at home - of what they have been missing. From playing smartly, confidently and coasting towards victory, Murray suddenly clammed up and the match took an unexpected turn. As one woman overheard at the back of Centre Court - along with many more on social media - said while waiting for the fourth set: ""It wouldn't be Andy without some drama, would it?"" The mood in the half-full arena - allowed because Wimbledon is part of the Government's Event Research Programme - had been buoyant from the start. Saltire flags, Scottish rugby shirts and tartan hats became more visible as Murray stoked up the atmosphere, with the home fans erupting in celebration at the end of the opening two sets. ""It is amazing to be back out here again on Centre Court. It was such a brilliant atmosphere, I have really missed playing in front of fans,"" Murray said. That joviality continued as he raced away with the third - until tension kicked in when victory loomed. Murray had served well until the latter part of the third set, where he was broken four times and saw his first-serve percentage drop to 47% The enforced break came at a good time for Murray and, watched on throughout by wife Kim and mum Judy, came out reinvigorated in the fourth. Twice he broke as the pair traded the opening three service games, rediscovering his nerve to survive three more break points and then claim victory at 21:49 BST. ""I did well to win the fourth set in the end because it was not mentally easy going back into the locker room,"" he said. To huge laughter, he added: ""I went to the shower and to the toilet - it was just a number one."" Murray's performance attracted a lot of attention, leading to Twitter posts from comedian Miranda Hart, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and Murray's fitness coach Matt Little which encapsulated the evening's entertainment.

"Convenience store owner Amit Puntambekar feels he is being let down by the police Almost a year ago, shop owner Amit Puntambekar, 28, found himself stuck between two customers, trying to stop one from hitting the other. The row had started outside his village store but carried on inside, ending in the older, taller, customer punching the teenage target of his anger. Mr Puntambekar managed to evict the aggressor and help the younger man, promising to report it to the police. He did so - but nearly 12 months later, nothing has happened. Mr Puntambekar is one of thousands of shop owners and workers who feel they are being let down by the police, according to a new report on violence against retailers by the Home Affairs Committee. The report has found that violence against retail employees has escalated over the past five years, increasing further through the pandemic. Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' Only essential retailers have been allowed to stay open during periods of lockdown, but both small and larger firms gave evidence to the committee, detailing extensive verbal and physical abuse. Supermarkets Morrisons and Sainsbury's told MPs their staff had been threatened with knives, firearms and even syringes. The Home Affairs Committee is now asking the government to consult on a standalone law that would make it a criminal offence to assault retail workers in England and Wales. It said that the problem is ""becoming endemic in British society and the policing response is failing to match the scale of the problem"". It cites a survey of shop workers conducted by the Association of Convenience Stores, which found that only one in five who reported incidents ""were satisfied with the response from the police"". ""When the police fail to attend or follow-up serious incidents, it undermines trust and confidence in them, discourages reporting, and weakens the deterrent for repeat offenders,"" the report said. Assistant commissioner Alistair Sutherland, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for business crime, said: ""Individual forces will have different tactics available to them and will use crime prevention initiatives most suited to the issues they are facing. ""We take reports of all types of retail crime very seriously, particularly those involving violence, and will seek to prosecute anyone who breaks the law in this regard."" He added: ""We recognise however, that there is more that we must do to encourage reporting and provide a better service and assurance to victims."" Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse, said the government is putting 20,000 extra police officers into communities to cut crime, ""including retail crime"". He added: ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines that mean courts should be increasing sentences for assaults committed against those providing a service to the public, including shop workers."" It is an issue that Mr Puntambekar is all too aware of: ""We phoned the police. We had all the incident, we had the customer's licence plate. I spent hours with the police tracking what direction he was coming from."" ""I sent them all the video evidence and nothing has ever happened."" Unfortunately, the parents of the young man who was assaulted now blame Mr Puntambekar. He said: ""I thought everything had proceeded fine [but] the parents no longer shop with us because they blame me for the incident and blame me for not following it up."" It has been compounded by the fact that Mr Puntambekar is not allowed to show the parents the CCTV video of what happened to their son, because of General Data Protection Regulation rules. ""So the parents, to this day, do not know what has happened to this poor lad because I can't legally show them the footage,"" he said. Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says Shop worker 'thought he was going to be stabbed' Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' The pandemic has exacerbated the problems that retailers are facing - industry group the British Retail Consortium says the number of violent incidents or abuse against shop workers between 2019 to 2020 rose by 7% to 455 attacks a day, compared to 424 a day during 2018 to 2019. At one point in the winter, Mr Puntambekar said his shop was losing between Â£300 to Â£400 a week due to theft. ""The police view it as a 'soft crime' because when a theft happens there is no penalty to the state or the government,"" he said. ""We will end up paying the liability for it."" As a shopkeeper, he says ""you accept there is always going to be a level of shrinkage of theft"", adding that ""there's not many other businesses where you think ""we going to lose Â£5,000 or Â£10,000 a year"". The National Federation of Retail Newsagents told the inquiry that they thought a ""strong police response"" to simple shop theft ""might serve to stop future, more serious incidents, but it is here that the police response is weakest"". Marks and Spencer added that local police have ""struggled to respond to reports of assaults"" in their shops. The company told the committee that as a result ""colleagues have become less inclined to report assaults to the police, as they believe that there is 'no point' when it is likely no action will follow"". This video can not be played 'I thought I was going to get stabbed,' says shop worker recalling robbery The report also suggests it is ""surprising that there is no mandatory process for recording crimes against retail workers as a specific group"" within police force crime statistics and that there is a ""much needed"" drive for data on incidents. The Home Affairs Committee is seeking a new standalone criminal offence that protects retail workers from violence and abuse in England and Wales - similar to that already passed by the Scottish government. ""A standalone offence for assault on emergency workers has produced promising early results in increasing prosecutions,"" said Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper. ""Violence and abuse towards shop workers must be treated with the same seriousness and those workers must be afforded similar protection in law.""

"European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ will be making an appearance in front of MLAs The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is ""confident"" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ  has appeared before a Stormont committee. Products such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea. It keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. But the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? NI business disruption needs to be fixed, says Lewis Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he had been in ""intensive contact"" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request. ""While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,"" he said. ""I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ also told MLAs that the EU was ""prepared to take bold steps"" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary. He repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. The UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be ""an abrogation of sovereignty"" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions. Speaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the ""indication"" from Mr Å efÄoviÄ that the extension would be granted. ""We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,"" she added. ""I do think the appearance of Maros Å efÄoviÄ really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol."" Analysis There are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol. So Maros Å efÄoviÄ was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'. I think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work. I think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn. Economy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as ""damaging and brutal"". He told the assembly it was being used as ""punishment and leverage"" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK. ""There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,"" he added. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ appeared by video link before the Executive Office committee Before the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr Å efÄoviÄ was ""fully appraised"" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. The UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September. Meanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol. The challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month. One of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning. Allow Twitter content?

"The ruling means adults will be able to apply for permits to cultivate and consume their own cannabis Mexico's Supreme Court has decriminalised the private recreational use of cannabis by adults, calling the current prohibition unconstitutional. In an 8-3 decision, the court ruled that adults would be able to apply for permits to cultivate and consume their own cannabis. Smoking in public and in front of children is banned. The ruling does not mention the commercialisation of cannabis. The decision came after a legalisation bill stalled in Congress. ""Today is a historic day for liberties,"" Supreme Court president Arturo ZaldÃ­var said. Health risks of recreational cannabis Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? But some groups said the ruling was unlikely to result in major immediate changes. Mexico United Against Crime, a non-governmental organisation, said the decision ""does not decriminalise the activities necessary to carry out consumption"" such as possession and transportation. Mexico's lower houseapproved a bill legalising the recreational use of cannabis in March, but it still needs final approval by the Senate. The legislation would let users with a permit carry up to 28g and grow as many as eight plants at home for personal use. At present, it is illegal to carry more than five grams. Supporters of legalisation hope it could reduce some of the violence related to illegal drugs trade, which claims the lives of thousands of people in the country every year.

"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021).

The pass is also required to travel on most public transport between regions. Thegreen passis a temporary pass, which lasts 48 hours. You can obtain one by testing negative with a rapid Covid test available from local pharmacies and test centres. The test provider will print the test results and email you a code. You will need these to accessthe government websitewhich will generate the temporary green pass.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"Mr Lapid (left) will inaugurate an embassy and consulate office during his trip The arrival of Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday is a landmark moment for his country and the Arab world. Mr Lapid is the first Israeli minister to pay an official visit to the Gulf state since Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed a historic deal to normalise ties nine months ago. During the two-day trip, Mr Lapid will meet his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and inaugurate the Israeli embassy and consulate office in Abu Dhabi and Dubai respectively. The visit is important not only for its symbolic significance but also because it will be the first official engagement between the two sides since the Israel-Gaza conflict in May. At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during the hostilities. The 11-day conflict was the first test for the newly forged relationship - especially given that the UAE leadership had billed the normalisation deal as an opportunity to halt Israel's plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, which were vehemently opposed by the Palestinians. Is business the 'path to peace' in the Middle East? Why Israel's peace deals with Gulf states matter In the lead-up to the fighting the UAE had condemned the potential eviction by Israel of Palestinians from homes contested by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem - a focal point for rising Israel-Palestinian tensions - and had urged Israel to defuse the situation. Trade between the two countries has rapidly grown During the hostilities, however, the UAE could do little to deploy diplomatic leverage to pressure the Jewish state to limit the scale of its attacks on Gaza, from where militants fired thousands of rockets. It is difficult to gauge public mood on contentious political issues in the UAE, an autocratic state, but anger was palpable on social media with citizens condemning Israeli action and showing support for Palestinians. Despite this, Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a Dubai-based political scientist, believes that Mr Lapid's historic visit shows that both countries have weathered the storm well. ""The bilateral relationship has passed its first test, and it shows its irreversible,"" he says. ""The UAE is adopting two tracks: first is the normalisation path, and the second that it still supports the Palestinian right to have their own state."" Israel and the UAE had different objectives when they decided to normalise ties last year. From Abu Dhabi's perspective, security was at the heart of its decision, while for Israel, economic co-operation with the UAE - and acceptance by an Arab state - were the main drivers. Shortly after the agreement, known as the Abraham Accords, was reached, then-US President Donald Trump's administration authorised the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE. This was a huge shot in the arm for UAE, as the acquisition will not only beef up its military capabilities but also give it a strategic edge in the region. The US agreed to sell the UAE 50 advanced F-35s after the normalisation deal According to Bader Al-Saif, a Kuwait-based fellow with the Carnegie Middle East Center, the agreement with Israel reflects the UAE's long-term ambition of being an important geopolitical player on the global stage. ""Through this deal, the UAE is betting on elevating its security stature in the region,"" he says. ""They have established themselves as an important economic hub but now they want to be one of main leaders in the Middle East."" The economic partnership has flourished since the accords were reached, with a flurry of business deals signed across multiple sectors, including healthcare, artificial intelligence, defence and travel. In April, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in an Israeli natural gas field for as much as $1.1bn (Â£790m; â¬922m). If the deal goes through it will be the biggest between the two countries yet. The UAE was the first Gulf state to normalise relations with Israel Data suggests that when it comes to trade ties, Israel has been the early winner. According to Karen Young, director of the Economics and Energy Program at the Middle East Institute, the total value of investments from the UAE to Israel touched $80m between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period, the capital inflow from Israel to the UAE amounted to less than $25m. Emirati investments into Israel have been led by state entities. Ms Young expects that trend to continue, especially after the recent Israel-Palestinian violence. ""What happened in May turned off a lot of private businesses in the UAE that may have been willing to go into Israel as investors,"" she says. But even as private investments from the UAE are expected to remain subdued, Ms Young thinks that investments by state entities - specifically in technology, defence, water and food - will continue as these sectors are a priority for the UAE government. ""There were going to be obvious difficulties in pursuing this relationship, including opening up investment ties, but they will hold firm because the UAE government is strongly committed to seeing this through,"" she says.

"Mr Lapid (left) will inaugurate an embassy and consulate office during his trip The arrival of Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday is a landmark moment for his country and the Arab world. Mr Lapid is the first Israeli minister to pay an official visit to the Gulf state since Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed a historic deal to normalise ties nine months ago. During the two-day trip, Mr Lapid will meet his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and inaugurate the Israeli embassy and consulate office in Abu Dhabi and Dubai respectively. The visit is important not only for its symbolic significance but also because it will be the first official engagement between the two sides since the Israel-Gaza conflict in May. At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during the hostilities. The 11-day conflict was the first test for the newly forged relationship - especially given that the UAE leadership had billed the normalisation deal as an opportunity to halt Israel's plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, which were vehemently opposed by the Palestinians. Is business the 'path to peace' in the Middle East? Why Israel's peace deals with Gulf states matter In the lead-up to the fighting the UAE had condemned the potential eviction by Israel of Palestinians from homes contested by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem - a focal point for rising Israel-Palestinian tensions - and had urged Israel to defuse the situation. Trade between the two countries has rapidly grown During the hostilities, however, the UAE could do little to deploy diplomatic leverage to pressure the Jewish state to limit the scale of its attacks on Gaza, from where militants fired thousands of rockets. It is difficult to gauge public mood on contentious political issues in the UAE, an autocratic state, but anger was palpable on social media with citizens condemning Israeli action and showing support for Palestinians. Despite this, Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a Dubai-based political scientist, believes that Mr Lapid's historic visit shows that both countries have weathered the storm well. ""The bilateral relationship has passed its first test, and it shows its irreversible,"" he says. ""The UAE is adopting two tracks: first is the normalisation path, and the second that it still supports the Palestinian right to have their own state."" Israel and the UAE had different objectives when they decided to normalise ties last year. From Abu Dhabi's perspective, security was at the heart of its decision, while for Israel, economic co-operation with the UAE - and acceptance by an Arab state - were the main drivers. Shortly after the agreement, known as the Abraham Accords, was reached, then-US President Donald Trump's administration authorised the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE. This was a huge shot in the arm for UAE, as the acquisition will not only beef up its military capabilities but also give it a strategic edge in the region. The US agreed to sell the UAE 50 advanced F-35s after the normalisation deal According to Bader Al-Saif, a Kuwait-based fellow with the Carnegie Middle East Center, the agreement with Israel reflects the UAE's long-term ambition of being an important geopolitical player on the global stage. ""Through this deal, the UAE is betting on elevating its security stature in the region,"" he says. ""They have established themselves as an important economic hub but now they want to be one of main leaders in the Middle East."" The economic partnership has flourished since the accords were reached, with a flurry of business deals signed across multiple sectors, including healthcare, artificial intelligence, defence and travel. In April, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in an Israeli natural gas field for as much as $1.1bn (Â£790m; â¬922m). If the deal goes through it will be the biggest between the two countries yet. The UAE was the first Gulf state to normalise relations with Israel Data suggests that when it comes to trade ties, Israel has been the early winner. According to Karen Young, director of the Economics and Energy Program at the Middle East Institute, the total value of investments from the UAE to Israel touched $80m between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period, the capital inflow from Israel to the UAE amounted to less than $25m. Emirati investments into Israel have been led by state entities. Ms Young expects that trend to continue, especially after the recent Israel-Palestinian violence. ""What happened in May turned off a lot of private businesses in the UAE that may have been willing to go into Israel as investors,"" she says. But even as private investments from the UAE are expected to remain subdued, Ms Young thinks that investments by state entities - specifically in technology, defence, water and food - will continue as these sectors are a priority for the UAE government. ""There were going to be obvious difficulties in pursuing this relationship, including opening up investment ties, but they will hold firm because the UAE government is strongly committed to seeing this through,"" she says.
