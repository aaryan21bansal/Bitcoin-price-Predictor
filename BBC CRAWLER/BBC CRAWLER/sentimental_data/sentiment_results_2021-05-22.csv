"This video can not be played The prince recalled spending four happy years at university in Scotland The Duke of Cambridge has said Scotland is the source of his saddest and happiest memories. Prince William recalled being at the Queen's Balmoral home in 1997 when he first learned of his mother's death. He found comfort and solace in the countryside there during the ""dark days of grief,"" he said in a speech to the Church of Scotland on Saturday. But he said Scotland was also where he first met his wife almost 20 years ago. ""The connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep,"" he said, during the opening speech of the church's General Assembly in Edinburgh, attended by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. His comments come two days afterhe blamed failings at the BBC over its interview with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, for fuelling her paranoia and worsening his parents' relationship. Addressing the assembly, the duke, who is also known as the Earl of Strathearn in Scotland, said: ""I was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. ""Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning and in the dark days of grief that followed I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. ""Alongside this painful memory is one of great joy because it was here in Scotland, 20 years ago this year, that I first met Catherine. ""Needless to say the town where you meet your future wife holds a very special place in your heart."" Prince William was welcomed with the Ceremony of the Keys in Edinburgh on Friday as he began his trip to Scotland Reminiscing about his time at the University of St Andrews in Fife, where he and the Duchess of Cambridge studied, he said: ""I spent four very happy and formative years studying in St Andrews. The town and the students left me alone to get on with student life, allowing me to share their freedoms - and their pubs. ""As I grew up I saw how my grandmother relishes every minute she spends here and my father is never happier than in walking among the hills. ""My childhood was full of holidays having fun in the fresh air, swimming in lochs, family barbecues with my grandfather in command, and yes the odd midge."" The Queen, who was at another royal engagement in Portsmouth, appointed Prince William as Lord High Commissioner to the assembly During the meeting, the Rev George Whyte, chaplain-in-ordinary and principal clerk of the Church of Scotland, read out a letter from the Queen.

"Hundreds of bags of rubbish were collected from Snowdonia in the last year The rise in people exploring the UK's beauty spots has seen a rise in countryside litter. With staycations on the rise because offoreign travel restrictions, a national park has asked litter-bugs to confess: ""Why did you mess up our mountains?"" Snowdonia National Park Authority hopes visitors who dropped litter will anonymously say why they did it in an online survey. Park bosses want to know why some people did not take their rubbish home. Wales' beauty spots have seen large visitor numbers during the coronavirus lockdown and Snowdonia, the 823-sq mile (2,130 sq km) area around Snowdon, has seen its fair share of litter. About 600,000 people a year climb Wales' highest peak, at the heart of Wales' oldest national park, but some do not take their rubbish home. Why litter is surging as lockdowns ease Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' 200 bags of rubbish collected by volunteers About 200 bags of litter were collected from the slopes of Snowdon in the two months over the summer of 2020, according to agroup of volunteers who have helped with litter picks The park authority has said firepits, camping gear, cigarettes and even human waste have been just some things left behind by visitors. Volunteers have been helping keep the slopes of Snowdon litter free Now Angela Jones, the national park's partnerships manager, is hoping to learn why some people drop litter instead of taking it with them. Questions on the survey ask people why some left their camping equipment behind and who visitors think is responsible for clearing up any rubbish. ""The gathering insights bit is the tricky bit,"" said Ms Jones. ""We want to get the people who have done it tell us why."" Snowdon is the highest peak in Wales at 3,560ft (1,085m) Rubbish was dumped outside places like the Snowdon summit cafe The authority has been distributing the questionnaire using social media. ""We expect some crazy answers,"" added Ms Jones. ""But if we get enough people to fill it in, we can get a better understanding."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played ""We're demanding McDonald's goes fully plant-based by 2025"" Animal rights protesters say they are blockading four McDonald's distribution centres in the UK to stop deliveries to the fast-food chain's 1,300 UK outlets. Animal Rebellion said activists were using trucks and bamboo structures to stop lorries leaving depots in Hemel Hempstead, Basingstoke, Coventry and Heywood, Greater Manchester. The group is targeting McDonald's ""for its role in the climate emergency"". McDonald's UK said it was ""assessing the impact"" of the protest on supplies. A spokeswoman said: ""Our distribution centres are currently facing disruption. We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items. We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused."" About 50 activists are stopping deliveries leaving four McDonald's depots across the UK Animal Rebellion spokesman James Ozden, at a protest in Coventry, accused the meat and dairy industry of ""destroying our planet"". Mr Ozden told the BBC the meat and dairy industry was ""causing huge amounts of rainforest deforestation, emitting vast quantities of greenhouse gases and killing billions of animals each year"". ""The only sustainable and realistic way to feed 10 billion people is with a plant-based food system. Organic, free-range and 'sustainable' animal-based options simply aren't good enough"", he said. Animal Rebellion wants McDonald's to commit to becoming fully plant-based by 2025. Protesters have tied themselves to bamboo structures which are blocking the depot's entrance and exit Basingstoke is one of four depots where people have attached themselves to bamboo structures blocking access to depots The group tweeted that it intends to remain at the sites for at least 24 hours and aims to cause ""significant disruption"" to McDonald's as the restaurants restock over the weekend. A second tweet called on McDonald's to personally engage with the activists at the protest sites,saying,external: ""We're waiting for them to come talk to us, or we'll stop their distribution to all 1,300 restaurants ALL DAY."" West Midlands Police said it was aware of the protest at the depot site in the Canley area of Coventry and there was a police presence there. The force said it recognised ""the right to a peaceful protest"", but expressed concern over the ""significant disruption to businesses"" caused by blocking the sole entrance and exit point to the distribution site. ""We have asked the small group of activists to remain mindful of road users and in particular emergency vehicles and will continue to maintain an open dialogue with them,"" a spokesman for the force said. Animal Rebellion describes itself as ""a mass movement that uses nonviolent civil disobedience to bring about a transition to a just and sustainable plant-based food system"". In November last year,the fast food giant announced plans to introduce a line of plant-based meat alternativescalled ""McPlant"" in 2021.

"The Zhurong rover drove down the ramp of the lander on to the surface of Mars China's remote-controlled rover, which landed on Mars a week ago, has driven down from its landing platform to the surface of the planet. This makes China the second country after the US to operate a rover there. The Zhurong robot is due to study the planet's surface rocks and atmosphere. It will also look for signs of life, including any subsurface water or ice. China's Tianwen-1 mission, consisting of an orbiter, lander and rover, was launched in July last year. Chinese Mars rover returns first pictures China succeeds in putting a probe in Mars orbit Remarkable photo of Mars rover during landing The deputy chief commander of the mission, Zhang Yuhua, said the rover was designed to operate for 92 Earth days (or 90 Mars days, known as ""sols"", which are slightly longer than Earth days) and would share its data via the orbiter. This video can not be played China landed its first spacecraft on Mars last week ""We hope we can get a comprehensive covering of Martian topography, landform and environment, and the exploratory data of the radar detecting the Martian subsurface during one Martian year,"" she said. ""By doing so, our country will have our own abundant and first-hand data about Martian resources."" This model shows how Zhurong descended from its landing platform The solar-powered, 240kg (530lb) six-wheeled robot - named after a Chinese mythical fire god - will be exploring Utopia Planitia in Mars' northern hemisphere. This colossal basin - more than 3,000km (1,860 miles) wide - was likely formed by an impact early in the planet's history. There is some evidence pointing to it having held an ocean long ago. Remote sensing by satellites indicates there are significant stores of ice at depth. The front view from Zhurong shows the flat landscape of Utopia Planitia Utopia Planitia is where Nasa landed its Viking-2 mission in 1976. The US landed the much larger (one-tonne) Perseverance robot in February, and its roving mission is also just getting under way. Europe's space agency, which has twice failed with landing attempts, will send a rover called Rosalind Franklin to Mars next year in a joint project with Russia.

President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez said the country was experiencing its worst moment of the pandemic. It has recorded more than 35,000 new cases a day during the past week. On Friday, Latin America and the Caribbean passed one million coronavirus deaths, almost 30% of the global total. Nearly 90% of those fatalities have been recorded in five countries: Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Peru. Argentina's new lockdown allows supermarkets and essential businesses to remain open, but in-person school lessons will be suspended. Restaurants can only operate home delivery and pick-up services, and people may only go out until 18:00, staying in the vicinity of their home. The government encouraged people to alert the authorities if they noticed their neighbours gathering or having parties. The restrictions are operating for a relatively short period amid concerns about the impact on the informal workforce and poorer households with limited internet access. Argentina's economy contracted by almost 10% last year, partly due to the lockdown. ""I am aware that these restrictions create difficulties,"" said President FernÃ¡ndez.

"Indoor hospitality can operate from Monday Northern Ireland has likely seen ""the end"" of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions, the finance minister has said. On Thursday, the executive agreed to ease some restrictions, allowing hospitality to operate indoors, and hotels and B&Bs to reopen from Monday. Conor Murphy said he ""sincerely believed"" there would not be a return to full lockdowns. He said even the worst case modelling showed the health service could cope. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Executive allocates Â£316m to Covid-recovery fund Asked on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme if Northern Ireland would see the same scale of regulations brought in again, Mr Murphy said: ""I believe it's the end of the restrictions as we have seen them. ""Even in the modelling we have seen, in the worst case scenario the health service can continue to cope, albeit it needs ongoing support. Conor Murphy says he ""sincerely believes"" Northern Ireland has seen the end of the most stringent restrictions ""Of course we can't, with a huge degree of accuracy, project into the future, we know there are other variants out in the world, we know they are having an impact in other places, we have to continue to protect ourselves and that's why the message remains that Covid is still with us."" However, he said restrictions and mitigation measures would continue for some time. On Thursday, Stormont announced it had allocated Â£316m in pandemic-recovery funding. Mr Murphy said it would take more than reopening to get businesses back on their feet. ""It is going to be a difficult time ahead for business so the executive now is going to focus more on economic recovery rather than businesses that have been closed."" Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. Sinead and Gerard Keenan, who own and manage Dan's Bar in west Belfast,thought they may be forced to sell-up due to lockdown. On Monday, they will reopen with a fresh coat of paint. Pubs that only sell drinks were among the first to close, and the last to reopen. Mrs Keenan told Good Morning Ulster: ""I'm super excited but super nervous. I'm hoping I still remember how to pull the perfect pint."" The Keenans have given their pub a fresh coat of paint ahead of reopening Michael Stewart, from House Hotel in Belfast, said it was not just about money. He said: ""It's been five months since hospitality closed its doors on Christmas Eve and it's been a long five months so it's very, very welcome. ""It's about getting the place back open, getting the tills ringing again but also getting people back into employment."" Kiera Duddy, owner of the Pickled Duck in Londonderry, said that it was ""full steam ahead"" for indoor dining. ""We were ecstatic when we heard the news on Monday that we could open indoors, because our weather here isn't what you would really call Mediterranean. ""The weather this time in May has been unfavourable to us, but we have made good of a bad situation and we've got our wind-breakers on and our gas heaters,"" Ms Duddy told BBC Radio Foyle. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external, including Portugal. People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Twelve countries are on Northern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel, including Portugal Brenda Cassidy runs Paddy's Irish Bar in Albufeira on Portugal's south coast with her husband and son. She told Good Morning Ulster the business may not have survived losing a second holiday season to Covid-19. ""There's an awful lots of places that haven't made it through. If it kept going, there's only so many local people who can keep the local bars going. Maybe some of the bigger bars can afford to close, the small local ones [can't] so we have to have tourism."" England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. People travelling from England who have had both Covid jabs candemonstrate their vaccination,externalstatus via the NHS app or a letter. However,the NHS app,externalthat proves a person is vaccinated so they can travel is incompatible with Northern Ireland's health and social care system, the NI Department of Health (DoH) has confirmed. Speaking at Stormont on Thursday, outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said the apps in England and Wales did not ""speak to"" the apps in Northern Ireland and Scotland. She said a short-term ""paper trail"" solution was being considered to prove vaccination, adding: ""That is not just a letter but you cannot just turn up with a letter that somebody from your office has typed out for you."" She said work was under way to have all apps in the UK connected. A DoH spokesman said: ""The NHS App uses information from NHS England computer systems. ""It is not directly compatible with NI Health and Social Care systems. Work is currently ongoing across the devolved administrations in regards to vaccine and testing certification, in order to support international travel when restrictions are eased."" DoH has set aside Â£3m in resources and a Â£1.5m capital allocation for Covid status certification, which includes digital ID. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers also backed the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.

Trading Standards has warned people not to click on links in text messages. Romance fraudsters 'preying on lonely' in lockdown Warning over fake Covid vaccine emails and text The most common types of fraud reported in Wales were online shopping and auction fraud, computer software service fraud and advanced fee fraud - where people make upfront payments for goods which do not arrive. There were about 575 fraud reports in Wales for every 100,000 people compared toan average of about 650 reports per 100,000 people for England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined. Across the three nations there were 389,328 fraud reports resulting in the loss of about Â£1.7bn. Charity Victim Support also said it had received an average of 716 fraud referrals in the first three months of 2021, compared to 371 for the same period in 2020. Overall, it said it received 7,617 fraud referrals in Wales between April 2020 and March 2021, compared to just 4,536 over the previous 12 months - an increase of almost 70%. A number of people have told BBC Wales they have experienced an increase in possible scam calls over the past few months. Lloyd Warburton, a student from Aberystwyth, tweeted last month about a number of calls he had been receiving from numbers he did not have saved in his phone, but were very similar to his own.

They seem to come in clusters. ""I used to get them quite a lot, but then they dropped off for a few years. There has been a noticeable increase, I would say, over the last nine months or so. ""I get all sorts. The impersonated numbers are the most common, but I get texts quite often claiming to have a parcel waiting for me to collect, or similar, when they're clearly just from someone's mobile."" Lloyd Warburton tweeted about scam calls he had been receiving from numbers similar to his own Peter Irvine from Aberaeron in Ceredigion, a student at the University of Bath, said he had noticed a similar trend starting earlier this year. He said: ""I received the first call on 15 February this year, I thought it was odd that it had the same initial six digits as my number. I answered and it was completely silent, and then put the phone down after."" Mr Irvine said he received another call later that month, with that phone number saying it had the same seven initial digits as his phone number. He said he has had another eight of these calls throughout the spring. ""They all have the same six to seven initial digits that match my number, so I don't think it's very coincidental at this point,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Carol Gerrard from Cardiff said she had also noticed an increase in potential scams during the Covid pandemic. She said: ""I rarely received them prior to the pandemic, maybe once or twice a year, but in the last month I have had at least six. ""My husband seems to get them even more than I do - he regularly has two or three a week, even though we block the numbers immediately. ""I get emails too, usually they are purportedly from Amazon or PayPal, but last month I had one from my email provider asking me to click on a link to update my account as I had exceeded my limit.

Alison Farrar from Trading Standards Wales said there was a new text message scam relating to the census, and warned people to not click on any links if they receive a message about it. She said: ""Scam calls and texts to mobile phones are a serious problem - there is no mobile phone equivalent to a landline call blocker to stop them coming through. ""Some of these messages are very convincing. Remember that no government agency would send you a notification demanding money via text or via automated telephone message. ""If a company sends you a link via text message to click on, ignore it. If you are unsure because you have an account with that company, contact them directly and don't use the link provided."" Welsh police forces said any scam texts should be forwarded to 7726, while emails can be forwarded to report@phishing.gov.uk. Trading Standards also advised blocking landline numbers and registering with the telephone preference service. Have you been affected by a scam or a fraud in the past year?

"This video can not be played Ever wondered where your recycling goes after it's collected, or why you have to clean it or separate it first? Wales has established itself as one of the world's top recycling countries. In 2017, environmental analysts Eunomianamed Wales the third best recycler in the world,external- behind only Germany and Taiwan. At the time, the nation's recycling rate was about 63%, which rose again to 65.1% in 2019-20. This is likely to have increased during the pandemic as people were forced to do more of their shopping online andcouncils reported a big surge in recycling. The difference in recycling rates between Wales and the rest of the UK could be described as a chasm. England recycled just 45.5% of its waste in 2019-20, with rates as low as 19% in some local authorities. Recycling rates in Northern Ireland (51.3%) and Scotland (44.9%) were also much lower than in Wales. So what accounts for this difference? Why do we recycle in different ways? The small town with a dirty secret Who's sending back plastic waste? A recent survey,externalsuggested almost three-quarters of people in Wales saw recycling as a positive social norm, with those living in rural areas also more inclined to recycle. Could it be this? Or could it be the intervention of the Welsh government,which has set strict targets for councils to hitor else risk a fine? BBC Wales went out on a collection round with Vale of Glamorgan council and visited its recycling centre near Cowbridge to find out more about the process - and whether there might be some other explanation. Binman Ellis Collins says it's clear there are ""a lot of people getting on board"" with recycling in Wales Ellis Collins, 34, has been working as a refuse collector for about two months. On a pleasant spring Thursday morning, he was out collecting recycling in Rhoose Point, near Cardiff Airport when he spoke to us. ""It's become massive and rightly so,"" Mr Collins said. ""You can't keep putting black bags out for landfill, that's not responsible. I think there's a lot of people getting on board."" Colin Smith, the council's operational manager of waste services, said he had seen ""such a transformation"" in his 30 years at the council - from everything going to landfill to over 70% being recycled. Each household in parts of the county will leave five bags or containers by the kerb Residents have to be invested in the process here because it's not a matter of simply separating recycling from general waste. Each household has left five bags or containers by the kerb - a blue bag for plastic, cans and cartons; an orange bag for cardboard; a white bag for paper; a grey box for glass, and a green caddy for food waste. ""It's a slower way of doing it but as long as it gets it done,"" Mr Collins added. Councils fall into two broad categories of recycling collection in Wales: ""co-mingled"", and separated. The majority of councils ask residents to separate their recycling before it is collected at the kerb. Vale of Glamorgan council has a fleet of wagons with compartments for different materials But five of Wales' 22 local authorities - Caerphilly, Cardiff, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire - all collect recycling that is mixed to some extent. Vale council is transitioning from co-mingled to separated. But it's not a straightforward choice for councils: they say there is a trade-off between the higher compliance you get with co-mingled collection, and the better quality and less contamination you get with separated recycling. To understand the dilemma, we went to Vale council's processing facility near Cowbridge. Once full, the crew will return to the council's processing centre near Cowbridge to offload the wagon Once the wagon is full, the crew return to the processing centre to offload. The first compartment to be emptied is glass. A digger then comes in behind to push the glass into a tidy pile. Eventually, it will be taken 30 miles (48km) down the M4 to Cwmbran, where it will re-processed into glass fibre or aggregate and used to construct bins or roads, for example. The wagon then moves inside the warehouse to the conveyor belt, where plastic, tins, cans and cartons are offloaded. Wales recycled 65.1% of its waste in 2019-20 After collection, this is the only part of the sorting process where there is input from a person who quickly checks the items whizzing past them for anything too contaminated. If it is too contaminated, it will be incinerated or will go to landfill. The conveyor belt takes these mixed items past two different magnets, which will sort the tins and aluminium into separate piles. Once the cartons, tins and cans have been separated out, the plastic drops into a hopper where it is crushed into bales, taken away and made into plastic pellet or flake, which can be used to produce new plastics. Steel from empty tinned food containers will be smelted and go back into the steel industry in south Wales The steel from tinned food will go back into the steel industry in south Wales, and the aluminium cans will eventually be made into new cans. The aluminium is crushed into bales weighing up to 350kg, and then smelted locally in Cardiff. Mr Smith said a tonne of aluminium cans can fetch Â£900 in the current market, and that one recycled aluminium can saves the energy of producing up to 20 new cans from raw materials. The next stop is cardboard, which will go back into commercial packaging, followed by paper, which is sent to a paper mill for re-use. ""So those products become 'closed loop',"" Mr Smith said. ""They are made and re-used again and again."" The final stop for the wagon is food waste, which is dropped into a sealed skip before it is taken to an anaerobic digestion plant in Cardiff and converted into a renewable energy source and fertiliser. Waste chief Colin Smith says separated collection means more than 95% of waste can be recycled With co-mingled recycling, all the material is collected together. While this is obviously a lot easier for residents, it creates problems further down the process, according to Mr Smith. ""The problem with co-mingled, and what we've found is, we've had up to 25%-30% contamination,"" he explained. ""That means, of everything we collect, 25%-30% will go to incineration because it's not fit for recycling. ""If you collect it separately, 95% and above of that material will get recycled."" Magnets help separate steel tins and aluminium cans from plastic and cartons The less contamination, the better the quality of recycled material. And Mr Smith said this means councils can sell it closer to home. ""A lot of the UK markets wouldn't take the material because of the contamination levels in it,"" he recalled. ""So we, along with many other councils in Wales, exported as far away as China and other Asian countries."" According to the Welsh government, the majority of Wales' recycling, more than a half a million tonnes, stayed within Wales. The next biggest recipient was England (329,000 tonnes), followed by India (13,306), Germany (10,288), Indonesia (9,283) and Turkey (5,875). 'Illegal' plastic waste returned to UK by Malaysia Reality Check: Where is the plastic waste mountain? Where the UK's recycling really goes The Welsh government said it wanted Wales to become the top recycler in the world. A spokesman added: ""We support local authorities to collect recyclable materials separately - as well as helping to improve recycling rates, it keeps high-quality materials in our economy and strengthens our supply chains."" BBC Wales asked the five councils that still collect co-mingled recycling why, and if they planned to switch to separated collection. At 71.6%, Ceredigion council's recycling rate is second only to Pembrokeshire (71.7%) in Wales. The council said it chose co-mingled collection after ""considerable appraisal"" of various factors, including geography and participation. The council added any significant changes were unlikely to be made before its fleet was due for replacement in 2026-27. Caerphilly council, which has a rate of 62.5%, said it switched from separated to co-mingled collection in 2008, which increased participation levels. It added the ""consensus"" among residents was to continue with the current system, and there was currently ""no plan"" to return to a separated system. Cardiff council, which had a rate of 58.1%, acknowledged the benefits of separated collections, but said it was far slower and more dangerous for crews, and could cause congestion in the city. It added it would be looking to trial the separation of glass from other recycling because of the potential for contamination, and was ""committed"" to meeting the Welsh government's target rate of 70% by 2025. Carmarthenshire council, with a recycling rate of 64.7% in 2019-20, said it was currently reviewing its waste strategy and was considering switching from fortnightly to weekly recycling and food waste collection. Details of the consultation will be published on its website from 26 May. Rhondda Cynon Taf council did not respond.
