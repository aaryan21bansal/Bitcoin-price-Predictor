"This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage shows extensive Mariupol shelling damage On day 19 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some civilians were able to leave the city of Mariupol along a pre-agreed route for the first time. Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east of Ukraine, is facing a humanitarian crisis after nearly two weeks of continuous Russian shelling, with food, water, and medicine running out and communication to the outside world all but cut off. There have been several previous agreements to allow civilians to leave the city, but they quickly broke down each time. On Monday, however, the Mariupol city council said 160 private vehicles had managed to leave and were on their way to the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia - a city to the north-west. The level of destruction in Mariupol was made clear in drone footage, which showed bombed out apartment blocks and smoke rising from the rubble. Last week, Russian bombs hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Powerful images of two pregnant women escaping from the wreckage were shared around the world. But on Monday,we learned that one of the women had diedalong with her baby who was stillborn by Caesarean section. After delivering the baby, who showed no signs of life, medics focused on the mother but were unable to keep her alive, surgeon Timur Marin told the Associated Press. In another vivid example of the terrible conditions in Mariupol, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC thatseveral burial sites had been dugto cope with the rising number of civilian deaths. Serhiy Orlov said the city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting dead bodies in the street. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol since the war began, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser. The BBC heard similar stories from local officials elsewhere in Ukraine, for example the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where more than 60 people were buried in a mass grave. The aftermath of Russian artillery shelling on a residential area in Mariupol Away from the dire situation on the ground, the war continues to have far-reaching international consequences. After multiple US news outlets reported that Russia had requested military help from China,the US warned that there would be consequences if Beijing helped Russiato evade sanctions. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation, and Russia later denied asking Beijing for military help. With tensions between the global superpowers so high, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that further escalation of the conflict ""threatens all of humanity"", with the prospect of nuclear conflict ""now back within the realm of possibility"". Vladimir Putin was the most prominent world leader to visit the Beijing Winter Olympics Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on the expensive homes around the world that belong to billionaire Russians, many of whom are allies of Vladimir Putin. On Monday,protesters in London climbed onto the balconyof a mansion in central London thought to belong to the energy tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who has been sanctioned by the UK government over the war in Ukraine. The protesters said they were reclaiming the building for Ukrainian refugees who have fled their homes.

Protesters have draped Ukrainian flags over the property, which is believed to be owned by Oleg Deripaska In the city of Kharkiv, in north-east Ukraine, the beloved Old Hem bar - named after the owner's literary hero Ernest Hemmingway - was destroyed by Russian shelling. An extraordinary image shared widely on social media showed the building which once housed the pub reduced to rubble. The owner - now in western Ukraine -told the BBC that he hopes to return one day to his city and rebuild his bar. ""We will win and Hem will rise again,"" Kostiantyn Kuts said. The pub was destroyed in shelling on Monday Russia's invasion is taking place on several fronts. Although Ukraine's resistance has been stronger than expected, Russian forces continue to take territory in the south and are slowly moving towards the capital, Kyiv.

"Videos of actors from a Ukrainian film shot in 2020 have gone viral on Facebook and TikTok - with people falsely claiming that attacks in the country are being 'staged' Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a wave of falsehoods on social media and the airwaves. In a new Radio 4 podcast series, War on Truth, our specialist reporter follows the stories of people caught up by misinformation - and gives some tips about how to avoid it. Since the war began, my inbox has been flooded with messages from people telling me about misleading videos on their social media feeds and troll accounts promoting conspiracy theories. And it's not just on social media - it's also state-sponsored propaganda pushing false claims on air and beyond. In anew podcast series, I'll be reporting on the information battle being waged over Ukraine - and hearing from the ordinary people sucked into it. How can you spot bad information - and stop its spread? There are very real, distressing videos being shared of what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. But there is also footage from old conflicts going viral. Often people share it because they're shocked - or even trying to help. But it's just adding to the chaos for those in the country. This footage was portrayed as being from the conflict in Ukraine - but was actually shot in Syria The best way to figure out if a video is real or not is to look for clues - like the weather, the road signs, the languages people are speaking. Videos of Russia's invasion of Crimea and from the blast in Beirut in 2020 have been shared widely, pretending to be from the current conflict. Using Google Maps, you can figure out if the video is really from where it claims to be. And by using reverse image searches - available from a number of websites - you can see if that same video or image has been shared online before. That's a tell tale sign that it's been recycled from a previous event. Newsround: How to tell what's fake and what's real False claims the war is a hoax go viral It's important to examine who shared a post in the first place. Can you verify who they are - and are they a trusted source? Those who have posted misleading videos are sometimes looking for likes and shares. It's a distressing time - and posts about what's happening in Ukraine are likely to catch on. Others are sharing false claims to push certain narratives - to boost their political agendas or to sow doubt and confusion. Several young people in the country have told me about pro-Russia accounts which argue with Ukrainians, suggesting without any proof that the war is ""staged"" or Ukraine is bombing its own territory. Ukraine invasion: Misleading claims continue to go viral How you can stop bad information from going viral How to verify videos One man I interviewed explained to me that even pictures of his home near Kyiv totally destroyed by bombs couldn't convince these trolls. Many of them have few or no followers, have taken their profile image from other places online and use generic usernames. They also only started to post after the invasion began. It's hard to tell who ultimately is running these accounts. Other accounts that have promoted false claims about the Covid pandemic have turned their attention to sharing false conspiracy theories about the war. The same false tropes - for instance that those injured by bombing are ""actors"" - have come up again and again, and have even beenpushed by Russian diplomats. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby SANCTIONS:Impact on everyday lives in Russia EXIT:Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad RECRUITS:Ukraine's teenage soldiers IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict A lot of what's on social media about the war is frightening. It triggers a reaction - and that means people sometimes share posts before checking if they're real. Disinformation spreads because it plays on our emotions and our biases. Steven Seagal is not fighting in the war - this is fake tweet made to look like it was sent out by CNN It's not just about negative emotions - sometimes hopeful stories can also go viral. While they may boost morale, they contribute to the chaos online and make it harder to figure out what's actually happening. The information war is about more than social media. It's a battle fought by governments in both Ukraine and Russia, which are pushing out propaganda. Question why a particular source might be saying something - and whether it's backed up by evidence.

"This video can not be played Caroline Lucas asks for an assurance the UK would not take part in a âmore arms for oil dealâ with Saudi Arabia The UK government is to discuss how to diversify energy supply following disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. Petrol prices for UK drivers have reached record highs of more than Â£1.60 a litre in recent days. The PM's spokesman said discussions with Saudi officials would look to tackle market volatility but there were no ""quick fixes"" available. It comes after 81 men were executed in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Foreign Office Minister Amanda Milling said the British government was ""deeply shocked"" by the executions, and opposed the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Replying to an urgent question from Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, she said the issue had already been raised with the Saudi authorities, and the government would continue to ""speak frankly"" about human rights. Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs Energy boss: US gas can replace Russian supplies Saudis execute 81 men in one day Mr Blunt said the executions were ""appalling"" and had presented the prime minister with ""exquisite difficulties"" when asking Saudi Arabia for help in easing oil shortages. Ms Milling told MPs the UK was phasing out Russian oil, adding that it was important to have stability in energy markets, and there was a role for OPEC - of which Saudi Arabia is a key member - in this. Human rights groups say many of those executed did not receive fair trials, but the Saudi government denies this. The average price of petrol for UK drivers hit Â£1.63 a litre on Sunday, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushing up costs. Asked whether the UK wanted Saudi Arabia - the world's second-biggest oil producer - to increase supplies, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We will be speaking to the Saudis about a range of issues, not just energy supply. ""Diversifying our energy supply is important, as is boosting renewable energy. There are no quick fixes but we do want to reduce the volatility and bring prices down."" Boris Johnson held a meeting with ministers and leaders of gas and oil companies - including Shell, Esso and BP - on Monday, during which he voiced a ""firm commitment"" to continuing extractions from the North Sea. They agreed to work to ""remove barriers facing investors and developers, and help projects come online more quickly"", Downing Street said. Saudi Arabia says those executed on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national, had been convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, torture, rape and weapons smuggling. The number put to death exceeded the 69 who faced that fate during the whole of 2021. ""The UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in every country as a matter of principle,"" the PM's spokesman said. ""We continue to raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia. We do not shy away from raising these issues with our partners."" In the Commons, Labour's spokesman Bambos Charalambous said it was no coincidence that the Saudis had carried out the mass executions while the world's attention was elsewhere. Responding to reports that Boris Johnson is to visit Riyadh, the SNP spokesman, Alyn Smith, said no such visit should take place, after what he described as an ""atrocity"".

"The US, UK and EU have put in place unprecedented financial penalties on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and hundreds of international companies have pulled out of the country. The impact of these measures is just starting to be felt, with the cost of basic products rising, a looming risk of job losses, and for some, an increasing sense of isolation. Here are some of the ways daily life has been changing. All names have been changed, and currency conversions were correct at time of publication. Consumer prices jumped 2.2% in the first week of the invasion, with food among the biggest rises  â¢ Some shops are restricting the sale of staples, after reports of hoarding â¢  Sales of medicines are not subject to sanctions, but with major shipping companies suspending services, supplies could be hit The rouble has plummeted since Russia invaded Ukraine, leading many retailers to raise their prices. Daria, who lives in central Moscow, says she's not yet seen empty shelves. ""Food won't disappear but will get more expensive,"" she says. ""How much more expensive, I can't imagine - and am scared to even think about."" Jan, is an EU citizen who lives and works in Moscow. ""On 20 February I ordered groceries for 5,500 roubles [about $57; Â£44] and now the same basket costs 8,000,"" he says. The price of milk has almost doubled in the past two weeks, he adds. Sugar and cereal prices were already about 20% higher this February than a year ago. Russian state news agency Tass said some retailers had agreed to limit price rises on some staples to 5%. Others are restricting the amount of basics like flour, sugar and oil that customers can buy. Daria has been stocking up. ""We bought 4kg of coffee, 4 litres of sunflower oil, 4 litres of olive oil and four bottles of whisky."" She has also ordered a three-month supply of medication for her high blood pressure - she says some drugs are already harder to get hold of. The price of some consumer goods has drastically increased â¢  The cost of smartphones and televisions has increased by more than 10% and an average vacation to Turkey has increased by 29% â¢  Major brands like Apple, Ikea and Nike no longer sell their products in Russia Daria had been considering buying new laptops for her family, and rushed ahead with the purchase as she saw prices steadily increase. ""At the beginning of February they cost about 70,000 roubles [$730; Â£560] but by the end of the month they had gone up to 100,000 roubles, which is what we paid. They then went up to 140,000 before they all sold out in Moscow."" They didn't buy iPhone chargers, though many others did - Apple said on 2 March that it would halt all direct product sales in Russia. ""We probably should have,"" Daria says. ""There's a joke now that we all have the last iPhone."" New cars have also gone up in price. ""We bought filters and oil for the car for when it needs a service,"" Daria says. ""We managed to buy them at the old prices before they almost doubled before our eyes."" Pavel, a university lecturer with a wife and two children, was looking to buy appliances for their flat in Moscow. On the day the war started, he saw some prices rise by nearly 30%. He managed to buy a fridge, cooker, washing machine and a kettle, and ordered a bed and a cupboard from Ikea just a day before it closed. He doesn't think prices in Ikea changed. ""They simply didn't have time to raise prices,"" Pavel jokes sadly. The symbolism of McDonald's closing its 847 restaurants has not been lost on Russians - it was among the first Western firms to open in the Soviet Union 30 years ago. Within hours of the announcement, thousands of adverts appeared from Russians reselling food from its restaurants, at up to 10 times the usual price. ""Nuggets and pies bought just before the restaurant chain closed down. Your last chance to taste foreign bliss,"" said one message. But Vladimir, who lives in Saratov in south western Russia, says he has yet to feel the impact of Western sanctions. ""Vatniki [Kremlin supporters] won't be affected by the fall in the rouble, because they don't buy expensive foreign goods."" Russian banks removed from Swift international payment system â¢ Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Apple and Google Pay limit their services in Russia â¢ Russian central bank says economy could shrink by up to 8% ""The situation has had a big impact on our business,"" says Natasha, who works in the fitness industry. ""Our customer numbers are down. People are asking us to refund their club membership. And our costs for rent, equipment and cleaning are all rising. Outgoings have gone up by 30% on average since sanctions were introduced."" She anticipates that many businesses like hers will close. Those that don't will struggle to find Russian manufacturers to replace imported equipment. Ekaterina runs a number of language schools and says the sanctions have already caused her problems. ""We have teachers in other countries we can't pay because all the transfer networks are frozen. We also have students in the US, Germany and Latvia who can't pay their fees into our accounts. We've found ways around it but at the moment every working day begins with fire-fighting a new crisis."" Ekaterina is worried how they will manage their international group lessons if Zoom is blocked, and says she has had problems because her online platforms were maintained by a company in Ukraine. ""Everything stopped immediately although we worked with them for ages. We were very happy with them and their work was top class. We are very upset for them, for ourselves, that we're all in this situation,"" she says. Natasha is finding it hard to come to terms with the changes. ""This is a completely new kind of crisis which makes us all feel lost and bewildered. Not just in business but in our own lives. The loss of income, having to give up a whole way of life, reduced connections, including on social media, and not being able to travel to see family and friends who live abroad. There are a lot of things we have already lost and haven't yet fully understood."" Daria says hearing about job losses as big international companies pull out of Russia worries her. ""So far there aren't any cuts in the government-funded projects I work on,"" she says, ""but I'm very scared of losing my job."" New law threatens to jail anyone deemed to have spread ""fake"" news on the invasion â¢ Independent and international media subject of severe restrictions â¢ More than13,000 people arrested,externalin anti-war protests Daria holds President Putin responsible for the sanctions, but most Russians get their news from state-run media, which carries the Kremlin's anti-Ukraine propaganda. Many people support him and may end up blaming the West for sanctions. Others don't approve of the war, but stay silent - it's risky for Russians to criticise their leader. Western governments hope the sanctions being piled on Russians will hurt enough to bring change at the top, but that could take time. This video can not be played WATCH: Staff from TV Rain walk off set after final broadcast The view that only better-off Russians will feel the pain of sanctions is debatable. No-one is sure quite what's going to happen next, but the economic fallout is expected to be severe and long lasting.  Russia's central bank said there had been a ""drastic"" economic change since the invasion. On the surface you might not guess what's going on in Moscow, says Daria. The city's cafes and restaurants are full, the metro is working, the traffic jams in the centre haven't gone anywhere. ""That's if you don't see the protests, the searches and the departures of creative people who make a big noise about leaving. A lot of other people are probably quietly leaving too. This gives me the feeling that we're running out of air,"" she says. Today's events bring back memories of the 1990s, when Russia's economy collapsed after the Soviet Union fell apart. ""It's been interesting talking to people in their 30s about those times and the ration cards we had for food. We had coupons and tokens to buy sugar, butter and vodka,"" says Daria. ""I remember the huge queues to buy sausage... There were often loud arguments, against selling things to the out-of-town shoppers. It was shameful. I hope it doesn't come to that again. ""I'm afraid that there will be more burglaries and robberies because of a sudden increase in poverty and job losses,"" she says. Jan says he hasn't noticed life changing in a big way and he doesn't plan to leave. ""My family and my work are here. It's very hard to start life all over again in a new place.""

"Petrol prices are likely to fall back from record levels due to the costs of wholesale fuel and global oil easing, UK motoring groups have said. The average price for a litre of petrol hit Â£1.63 on Sunday after rising above Â£1.60 for the first time last week. Diesel remained above Â£1.73 a litre, but the AA said ""wild"" pump prices should stabilise, unless global oil prices take off again. But MPs were told this was a ""lull before the storm"" of more price hikes. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said consumers ""need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked oil costs to surge worldwide. Mr Piper told theTreasury Committee,external: ""If more stringent actions are imposed upon Russia, and five million barrels a day is truly taken out of the market, then oil prices would really have no ceiling."" He explained that the UK was roughly self-sufficient in petrol but imported much of its diesel. Two thirds of UK consumers use diesel so that it could see the biggest price increases at the pump, he said. Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around Â£2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of ""Â£2.50 - even closer to Â£3"" were ""definitely in the realms of possibility"". She said the UK could follow Germany in introducing rationing measures which have already seen BP and Shell reduce diesel wholesales to industry. ""If we need to rebuild stocks over the summer so that we have a buffer over the winter...it is industry that will need to be curtailed and that's where the first set of rationing will have to come in,"" she said. Mr Piper said the only other option was for the government to release some of its stockpiles of petrol and crude oil. ""But it'll be industry that takes the brunt of any rationing initially,"" he said. Meanwhile, the AA said filling up a typical 55-litre car tank now costs Â£89.90p on average, up from Â£68.57 a year ago. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hitting a near 14-year high at one point. However, in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped as fears that the European Union would follow the US and Canada in banning Russian oil have eased. Brent crude fell as much as 8% to trade at $103.68 per barrel on Monday. Petrol price hits new record above Â£1.60 a litre How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The RAC said drivers would have to stomach probably more rises this week, but added they ""should soon get some respite from pump prices jumping by several pence a litre every day as oil and wholesale prices appear to have settled"". ""The price hikes seen over the weekend are still a result of the oil price rise which began at the start of the month and peaked early last week at $137 a barrel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""As the oil price has now fallen back, we should hopefully reach the peak and start to see prices going the other way to reflect the big drop in wholesale costs seen at the end of last week, subject to no further spikes in the barrel price this week."" The reason higher prices at the pumps are likely to remain despite falling commodity prices is due to the way retailers buy the fuel and the time lag between purchasing at a certain price and then selling it on. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said a 10.6p-a-litre slump in wholesale petrol costs on Wednesday and Thursday last week, followed by oil's fall in value, had produced ""bizarre price anomalies"". ""In one town this weekend, filling a tank at one forecourt was more than a pound cheaper than directly across the road at another,"" he said. Mr Bosdet said weekends were the busiest time for forecourts and the rush by drivers to beat further potential price increases had pushed up demand, which had actually led to even higher prices at the pumps as stations had to resupply at a faster rate. Rounded figures correct as of Jan 2022 Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. But the price of Brent crude dropped in recent days, due to reduced fears of a European ban on Russian oil, and also partly due to speculation that extra supplies could come onto the market from Iran, Venezuela and the UAE. The conflict in Ukraine has led to concerns being raised by Western nations about where they get their energy from. Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production was ""an issue of national security"" and not just of decarbonisation. Speaking at an event in London, he said: ""By switching to cheaper power generated in the UK, for the UK, we will ensure that we're not dependent on any unfriendly foreign country to keep our homes warm and lit."" However, Mr Hands acknowledged that the transition to cleaner energy sources would take time, and there was still a need to invest in domestic fossil fuel production.

"A pregnant woman wounded in the Russian bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital has died along with her baby, reports say. Images showed her on a stretcher following the air strike in Mariupol last Wednesday, in which at least three other people were killed. After the place where she was meant to give birth was attacked, she was taken to another hospital. Her baby was born by Caesarean section, but showed no signs of life. The surgeon, Timur Marin, told the Associated Press news agency that the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics said that as they were trying to save her life, she realised she was losing her baby and shouted, ""Kill me now!"" When it became clear to them that the child was stillborn, they tried to resuscitate the mother, but realised after 30 minutes that it was hopeless. Doctors said they did not have time to take the woman's name before her husband and father came to retrieve her body. That meant she did not end up in one of the mass graves being dug for victims of the Russian shelling of the city, they added. After the bombing of the hospital,Twitter removed two posts by the Russian embassy in Londonwhich claimed the attack had been faked. The embassy's tweets made unfounded claims that the hospital was not operational at the time and that injured women pictured at the scene were actors. The embassy also cast aspersions on another pregnant woman, photographed escaping from the wreckage of the hospital, who gave birth the day after the bombing. The image of Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack. In response to assertions that she was not actually pregnant, the BBC's disinformation team found evidence that contradicted the allegations.

"Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch Ed Sheeran ""belittled"" a songwriter who accused him of stealing one of his songs, London's High Court has heard. Sami Chokri says he was hurt by the tone of Sheeran's lawyers' emails after he noticed similarities between his song Oh Why and Sheeran's Shape Of You. ""I feel like I've been robbed by someone I respect, or respected,"" he told the court. ""This is years of a cloud over my head. All I heard and read was emails belittling me and my questions."" He continued: ""All I wanted to do was ask for an explanation. If I'd had one we wouldn't have had to go through with this rubbish."" He later called the trial ""the most horrible few weeks of my life"". Mr Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, says the ""oh I, oh I, oh I,"" hook on Shape Of You is ""strikingly similar"" to the chorus of his song, which was released two years earlier. In a witness statement, he said he first became aware of the alleged plagiarism in 2017. ""I was a passenger in my girlfriend's car and Shape Of You came on the radio,"" he wrote. ""She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities. Mr Chokri later put out a Facebook post saying, ""Anyone else think Ed Sheeran's new song Shape Of You chorus sounds familiar lol?"" ""I had lots of responses,"" he said, including one from Sheeran's friend Jamal Edwards featuring the ""shifty eyes"" emoji - which was later deleted. ""I thought maybe he had played a part in showing [my song] to Ed,"" Mr Chokri told the court. ""I had no reason to ever consider it coming to circumstances like these."" Before his death last month, Mr Edwards gave a written statement in which he denied playing Oh Why to Sheeran. ""Even if I was sent a copy, I did not share it with Ed,"" he wrote. ""I respect what Jamal says,"" Mr Chokri responded in court, ""but I also believe that Jamal would share music with Ed Sheeran."" Sheeran and his co-writers Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac have all denied copying Oh Why. Last week, Sheeran told the court that the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He added: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Giving evidence on Monday, Mr Chokri disputed the star's claim, saying: ""I believe Ed Sheeran heard it, that's my truth."" Asked if he was accusing the star of lying under oath, he responded: ""I'm not sure if he lied or he doesn't remember."" Giving evidence last week, Sheeran said he originally wrote Shape Of You for Little Mix In his witness statement, Mr Chokri said he had written Oh Why in June 2014 at a time when he was ""truly in pain"". ""I remember specifically that I was drinking some wine that day whilst we were writing and recording,"" he wrote. ""I was saying, 'Why do I keep putting myself back in this place?' ""I recall singing to Ross [O'Donoghue, his co-writer], 'Oh why, Oh why, Oh why?' and Ross saying something along the lines of, 'That's It! Let's work on that'. ""The song really resonated because it was a little bit different to anything else that I had made."" Mr Chokri later tried to get Sheeran to listen to the song ""as I was inspired by his success and stardom and his endorsement would be a significant boost"". To increase his chances, he sent an EP that included Oh Why to several people in Sheeran's circle, including producer Adam Coltman, musician Jake Roche and Jamal Edwards. Giving evidence, Mr Chokri said he was certain that one of them would have played it to the star - but ""I can't tell you exactly which because I don't know"". Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, suggested that Oh Why was itself inspired byEd Sheeran's cover of the Johnny Cash song The Wayfaring Stranger.,external ""I doubt it,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""That was a life-changing day for me. I wasn't thinking about Ed Sheeran, I was thinking about staying alive."" He acknowledged being a fan of Mr Sheeran's work, and The Wayfaring Stranger in particular. ""I definitely appreciated his work,"" he said, ""but I've got a bitter taste in my mouth since he stole a part of my song."" Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue first accused Sheeran and his copying their song in 2018. The trio denied the claims and launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed any copyright. Several months later, Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue issued their own claim for ""copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement"". In court, Sheeran's lawyer noted that Mr Chokri had not registered Oh Why with music rights body the PRS until April 2017 - three months after Shape Of You was released. ""The fact you weren't registered is indicative of the fact you weren't earning money"" from the song, he said. ""My main focus... was to get my name out there,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""I didn't think about money at all."" Mr Mill suggested the real reason for registering the song was so Mr Chokri could pursue his copyright claim. ""I was advised that would be the next step,"" he told the court, but ""didn't know that signing up to PRS was for that purpose"".

"A leading food industry boss has warned that prices will spike as a result of the war in Ukraine. Ronald Kers, the boss of food firm 2 Sisters, told the BBC that the cost of food could rise by up to 15% this year. He added that the price the company pays for chicken from the farm has jumped. Top UK flour producer GR Wright & Sons' has also warned its prices are ""absolutely certain"" to rise due to the conflict. Russia and Ukraine are some of the world's biggest suppliers of wheat and exports are expected to be affected by the war. In addition, the price of gas - which is used to heat greenhouses and to make fertiliser, which is essential to food production - has soared. War in the region is likely to exacerbate prices that were already increasing during what has been described as a cost of living crisis, according to some experts. 2 Sisters employs more than 14,000 people in the UK and specialises in poultry and chilled foods. Its chief executive told the BBC's Today programme that it had already been forced to pay 50% more for chicken it receives from farms. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices He suggested that if the war continues for months, ""fundamentally it means as a country we may need to start importing less and producing more ourselves"". ""We need to work together with all supply chain partners to find a solution... it's a very complex issue."" Mr Kers also suggested that the UK's exit from the European Union had made matters more difficult, due to a bigger administrative burden for farmers and less alignment on rules with food companies on the continent. Meanwhile, David Wright, managing director of flour milling company GR Wright & Sons', said that cost increases would ""inevitably"" be passed on to consumers. The firm, which has over 44% of the market share for the UK's bread mixes, said it was already struggling with soaring inflation before the conflict, with costs jumping by 30% between September and December. ""Now we have a similar increase [in price due to Ukraine], but instead of it taking four months it has taken two weeks,"" Mr Wright told BBC Breakfast. Each lorry load of wheat the firm buys costs now costs an extra Â£2,500, he said. With the company buying around 20 loads per day, it faces paying an extra Â£1m per month to keep the business running. Though availability will not be an issue, Mr Wright said, he is ""absolutely certain"" that consumer prices will need to rise. ""The price is so high so quickly that if you don't put the price of flour up, businesses will go out of business - it's as simple as that,"" he added. The comments come shortly after the National Farmers Union (NFU) warned that food production could be hit, affecting the affordability of food in the shops for years. In a letter to the government,externallast week, it called for urgent help for farmers. ""The government must act now, with a clear signal that food security is a priority for the nation,"" the NFU said. NFU president Minette Batters also told the BBC last week that the rising cost of producing fruit, vegetables and meat could cause farmers to make less at a time when the nation needs more. ""I think the whole world has got to recognise that this is not something we've faced before, we are going to see wheat price inflation levels that have never happened,"" she said. It suggested that farmers have been absorbing costs that have gone up so far. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries UK feed wheat prices, for example, are already 39% up on March 2021 at Â£279.40 a tonne, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Other organisations have warned that any costs passed on by food producers would hit those on the lowest incomes the hardest. Research from the Resolution Foundation think tank published on Monday suggests that the war in Ukraine could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn. It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, called on the chancellor to protect poorest households the ""biggest cost of living crisis Britain has faced in generations"" at his upcoming spring statement on 23 March. The jump in oil prices since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has pushed up fuel prices, and the price of unleaded petrol hit another record high in the UK at the weekend. The RAC said the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol hit 163.46p on Sunday, while diesel rose to 173.44p. However, oil prices have fallen from their highs and the AA said that ""wild"" pump prices should stabilise or fall back this week, unless the price of oil takes off again.

"High demand for workout gear and health-conscious vegetarian options are now being used to calculate the change in the cost of living in the UK. Items such as tinned beans, boosted by a rise in plant-based diets, have also been added to the basket of goods used to measure prices. The review by the Office for National Statistics also saw pet collars added. But men's suits and doughnuts are out as homeworking shifted how we dress and snack during Covid lockdowns. The ONS said it decided to add meat-free sausages to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate how the cost of living is changing, to reflect a boost in demand for healthier food options. It also said that the removal of a men's two-piece suit, and the addition of sports bras and crop tops, accounted for the fact that spending on formal clothes has been falling, as well as a ""heightened awareness of fitness"". ""With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,"" ONS head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said. Since the start of the pandemic, retailers such as Boohoo and Asos have reported a boost in sales for loungewear items such as joggers or hoodies too. In total, 19 items were added while 15 have been removed. And although the deletion of doughnuts from the basket might suggest customers are opting for healthier snacks while working-from-home, multipacks of cakes are still included in the calculation. Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15% Why are prices rising so quickly? Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' Other additions to the basket of goods signalled a shift in how consumers are spending during the pandemic. Anti-bacterial wipes, as well as craft and hobby kits for adults, were included in the basket of goods for the first time. Pet collars for dogs and cats were also added ""to reflect the growth in pet accessories linked to the increase in pet ownership more generally during the pandemic"", it said. Items such as atlas books or encyclopaedias, as well as coal, are out too. The official statistics body pointed out that the sale of domestic coal will be banned in 2023 as part of the government's attempt to tackle climate change. Dropping the item this year protects the index from being affected by big swings in price as that headline approaches. The publication comes as experts point out that what has been described as the cost of living crisis could be exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. On Monday, research from the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that the war could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets. Some analysts suggested on Monday that the update to the basket of goods was ""out of touch with the everyday expenditure for the masses"". Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said that climbing sessions, which was added this year, ""is unlikely to rank highly on the list of spending priorities among those struggling to make ends meet during the cost-of-living crisis"". ""We all have our own inflation number, and it is worth keeping tabs on your spending habits to get a better idea of the goods and services that are eating most into your budget, and where you could cut back,"" he added. With inflation at the highest rate seen in 30 years, the ONS's methodology has come under extra scrutiny because of the concern that product selections do not reflect purchases made by those on lower incomes. Poverty campaigner Jack Monroe had complained that the official way inflation is calculated fail to accurately reflect this. The ONS has said some changes were already in the pipeline to address that.From 2024, it will use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills, which should make it easier to work out if certain brands of pasta or beans, for example, are rising faster than others.

"The first refugees from Ukraine are expected to be matched with people in Northern Ireland offering shelter on Friday A Northern Ireland couple who have opened their home to refugees fleeing from Ukraine say they could not stand by in the face of such suffering. ""I would like to think if I was in need, somebody would open their arms and help me,"" said Mandy Durrell. TheHomes for Ukraine schemeis now taking applications from people in Northern Ireland who want to offer shelter. The first refugees are expected to be matched with home-owners on Friday. Mandy and Mark Durrell are among those from NI offering shelter to refugees Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: ""People can register from today and we'll start matching people from Friday, if they're able to offer accommodation, whether it's people who've got spare accommodation, businesses and individuals who can do that. ""It's that generosity of spirit here in the UK we want to tap into and give people the chance to do whatever they can to support."" Husband and wife team Mandy and Mark Durrell were among the first to register and offer a room. Both Methodist ministers covering four churches in Bangor, they said watching the news from Ukraine had been heart-breaking. ""We want to offer space, companionship, comfort and safety,"" said Mark. ""We have this home. There's two of us and the dog and there's space here to give someone refuge and sanctuary."" Mandy said Methodist manses - ministers' Church-owned homes - were always big enough to house travelling preachers, as well as anyone who might be in need. ""We are only doing what Methodist people are meant to do,"" she said. ""Yes, it puts us out of our comfort zone - certainly me - I like my own space. But when you see what people are going through, you have to challenge yourself. ""You can't not. You really can't. ""People are fleeing for their lives and you see wee old people and children who are losing their parents and women having to leave their husbands behind not knowing if they are ever going to see them again. The couple are offering a room that is carpeted and fully furnished. They are waiting now to hear from the government what they need to do next. ""Some of the times we're praying and asking God to answer our prayer, when you could be the very answer to that prayer,"" said Mark. ""If we have got the space it's selfish for it to sit there when somebody has been put out of their home."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Executive said it was working ""at pace"" to get the scheme up and running. More than 1.5m refugees have fled to Poland, amid brutal shelling of cities across Ukraine Hosts will be offered Â£350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government. A spokesperson for the Executive Office said: ""Safeguarding is a central priority in our preparations to accommodate Ukrainian refugees here. ""All hosts and beneficiaries will undergo criminal records (DBS) checks. In addition, we intend to work with partners locally to help ensure refugees are safe and connected to the services and support they need. ""We are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees. ""Mindful of the pressure on social housing stock, officials are also engaging with councils and the voluntary and community sector to find creative ways of bringing suitable accommodation into use and identifying all available capacity."" How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee The spokesman said the department was in close contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing as well as with colleagues in other jurisdictions. ""We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort. Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."" Justyna Bell is originally from Poland but lived in Belfast for a number of years - she now lives with her husband, a Belfast native, in Norway, where some families have begun to welcome refugees into their homes. She told BBC News NI that they have been housing three sisters from Ukraine since Saturday evening. ""The youngest of our guests is going to be able to go to school, and the adult sister will get a right to work pretty much straight away so this is very important,"" she said. ""They're from a family with seven children and only the three sisters managed to get across (the border) because their older brother was stopped, he's over the age of 18 and he's not allowed to leave the country. ""So then their mum and dad decided to stay as well. Justyna says they have been adjusting to having three more people in their house ""The biggest emotions were when we heard they boarded the airplane. ""It's really hard to unleash all the emotions when they have been through so much so I think for them, they describe it as being 'flat'. ""We've been hugging a lot but apart from that it's not an outburst of emotions."" Justyna said they had previously looked at housing refugees from other conflicts so a lot of the groundwork had already been prepared and she had this advice for anyone considering doing the same. ""It's really good to think about it first and have a conversation in the household and really open up and not think it's not very humanitarian if you have some objections,"" she said. The debate about offering sanctuary and the best way to support people fleeing Ukraine has divided opinion. More than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, the UN estimates Journalist and commentator AndrÃ© Walker, who has just returned from the region, said the situation for fleeing Ukrainians was chaotic. ""Every man from age of 18 to 60 has been conscripted,"" he told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""If it were me and my husband or wife was trapped in the country, I would not be wanting to go to Northern Ireland, I would want to be just over the border in Poland."" Many refugees were reluctant to travel a long way, he added. ""They want to be near their husbands. I don't think we should be dragging them away just because it makes us feel virtuous."" ""How many people during the Troubles decided to move to Liverpool and Dublin and how many moved to Kiev?"" However commentator Mairia Cahill told the Nolan Show that this situation was unprecedented. ""Ireland has taken 3,000 people in two weeks... when there are people who are prepared and able to travel and those restrictions are not put in their way, they are quite happy to come to Ireland."" She said the UK had put in place ""every amount of bureaucracy they can to stop taking people in"". Concern had been expressed over Northern Ireland's contribution to the Ukraine response in the absence of a first and deputy first minister in office to lead the effort. Paul Givan resigned as first minister earlier this year as part of the DUP's protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Patrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said: ""I am concerned that the absence of a first minister and deputy first minister, who have lead responsibility for refugee matters, has led to Northern Ireland being left behind when it comes to playing our part in offering a welcome to refugees from Ukraine."" Irish premier Micheal Martin said at the weekend that Ireland has accepted 5,500 Ukrainian refugees so far, and may take in more than 100,000. Details of the Homes for Ukraine scheme were announced on Sunday and the project will be overseen by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

"The arrivals process into England is set to become easier for travellers The transport secretary has confirmed that all remaining Covid travel measures will be scrapped. Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive. Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving. Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday. His announcement means that passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer have to take Covid tests before and after travelling to the UK. The passenger locator form will no longer be necessary either. People planning an overseas trip will still need to be aware of other countries' entry rules. Mr Shapps tweeted: ""These changes are possible due to our vaccine rollout and mean greater freedom in time for Easter."" When any new Covid strains appear in the future, the government said its default approach would be to use ""the least-stringent measures"" for restricting travel. Its ""Living with Covid"" plan said new measures at the border would only be considered in ""extreme circumstances"". It said the UKHSA would closely monitor the prevalence and spread of Covid variants. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans? Scotland and Wales have agreed to follow England in scrapping the remaining coronavirus border measures. But Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so ""reluctantly"" - and was ""extremely disappointed"" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched. The Scottish government said consistency across the four nations was agreed because of the ""negative impact of non-alignment on the tourism industry"". Testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals into the UK were dropped in February. The latest move was welcomed by some figures in the travel industry, which has campaigned forthe remaining rules to be droppedso businesses can take full advantage of strong summer holiday demand. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: ""Today's announcement sends a clear message to the world - the UK travel sector is back. ""With travellers returning to the UK no longer burdened by unnecessary forms and testing requirements, we can now look forward to the return to pre-Covid normality throughout the travel experience."" A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""The removal of all remaining UK travel restrictions is the final important step towards frictionless air travel, helping to further restore consumer confidence as we welcome more customers back to the skies this spring and summer. ""To uphold the experience of all travellers, it's vital that the UK Government works closely with industry to ensure the UK border is ready for increasing passengers, as international travel ramps up."" Meanwhile, Eurostar's chief executive Jacques Damas said the easing of restrictions would help the cross-Channel train operator's recovery. ""We hope and expect to see the UK's approach replicated across our other markets in the coming weeks,"" Mr Damas said. However, as Covid restrictions recede, other headwinds for the aviation industry are appearing. The price of jet fuel has soared as a result of higher crude oil prices. This adds to cost pressures on airlines, although some have been protected by their hedging strategies, whereby they purchased fuel in advance at lower prices. On Friday, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, said the recovery of aviation remained ""overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". Businesses will also be keeping a careful eye on whether consumers' confidence to book is knocked by the war in Ukraine and rising household bills squeezing disposable incomes.

"Mr Sullivan, seen here in a file picture, warned that the US would not allow China to provide a ""lifeline"" to Russia China will face consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions in its invasion of Ukraine, the US says. Unnamed US officials told multiple news outlets that China had signalled willingness to provide military assistance to Russia. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation. Russia denied asking Beijing for military help. The exchanges came before top US and Chinese officials met in Rome. Media outlets, citing Washington officials, say that Russia has in recent days asked China specifically for military equipment, including drones. On Monday, the US warned allies that China had suggested it was open to a move to provide military and economic support, media reports said. The report came as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, for talks in Rome. ""Mr Sullivan raised a range of issues in US-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" a readout of the meeting said. ""They also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China."" In an earlier CNN interview, Mr Sullivan said the US was ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them"". ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said. He added that while the US believed China was aware that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was ""planning something"" before the invasion happened, Beijing ""may not have understood the full extent of it"". Russia's military action is now in its third week and has horrified much of the world ""Because it's very possible that [Mr] Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others,"" Mr Sullivan said. In response, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhao Lijian, said the US had ""been spreading disinformation targeting China on the Ukraine issue, with malicious intentions"". Asked if he could clarify whether China had received a request for military help from Russia, Mr Zhao said this was ""fake news"" but did not deny it directly. He added that China's stance had always been consistent and that China was playing a constructive role in promoting talks. President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports Russia had asked China for military assistance were not true. ""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full,"" he said. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US raised concerns with the Chinese delegation ""directly and very clearly"". China has so far refrained from condemning Russia for the invasion and has said Moscow's ""legitimate security concerns"" should be taken seriously. When the United Nations General Assembly voted to condemn Russia's invasion earlier this month, China was one of 35 countries that abstained. But Beijing at the same time has expressed ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty. It has also called for peace and has said it is ready to help end the war through diplomacy. Several countries have urged China to do more to stop Russia's invasion. The EU and US help Ukraine, China helps Russia; if that's how this goes, then it's a delineation that will make the war in Ukraine an even more consequential one. The White House has decided to make public its claim just as President Biden's top security adviser is due to meet China's most senior diplomat. It appears to be a tactical move, to put pressure on China; presumably to either confirm or deny it. The bigger aim could be to try to make Xi Jinping weigh up the pros and cons to his current position of what was last week called a ""rock solid"" relationship with Moscow. Remember that it was just weeks ago, as the Winter Olympics opened in Beijing, that Presidents Xi and Putin declared a new alliance that had ""no limit"". Military aid could, clearly, be part of that. But in the days after Russia's invasion China has condemned the UK, the US and others for giving weapons to Ukraine's military, saying they were adding ""fuel to the fire"". If the US intelligence assessment is correct and Beijing follows through on that request, then they too would be ""adding fuel"".

"Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch Ed Sheeran ""belittled"" a songwriter who accused him of stealing one of his songs, London's High Court has heard. Sami Chokri says he was hurt by the tone of Sheeran's lawyers' emails after he noticed similarities between his song Oh Why and Sheeran's Shape Of You. ""I feel like I've been robbed by someone I respect, or respected,"" he told the court. ""This is years of a cloud over my head. All I heard and read was emails belittling me and my questions."" He continued: ""All I wanted to do was ask for an explanation. If I'd had one we wouldn't have had to go through with this rubbish."" He later called the trial ""the most horrible few weeks of my life"". Mr Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, says the ""oh I, oh I, oh I,"" hook on Shape Of You is ""strikingly similar"" to the chorus of his song, which was released two years earlier. In a witness statement, he said he first became aware of the alleged plagiarism in 2017. ""I was a passenger in my girlfriend's car and Shape Of You came on the radio,"" he wrote. ""She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities. Mr Chokri later put out a Facebook post saying, ""Anyone else think Ed Sheeran's new song Shape Of You chorus sounds familiar lol?"" ""I had lots of responses,"" he said, including one from Sheeran's friend Jamal Edwards featuring the ""shifty eyes"" emoji - which was later deleted. ""I thought maybe he had played a part in showing [my song] to Ed,"" Mr Chokri told the court. ""I had no reason to ever consider it coming to circumstances like these."" Before his death last month, Mr Edwards gave a written statement in which he denied playing Oh Why to Sheeran. ""Even if I was sent a copy, I did not share it with Ed,"" he wrote. ""I respect what Jamal says,"" Mr Chokri responded in court, ""but I also believe that Jamal would share music with Ed Sheeran."" Sheeran and his co-writers Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac have all denied copying Oh Why. Last week, Sheeran told the court that the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He added: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Giving evidence on Monday, Mr Chokri disputed the star's claim, saying: ""I believe Ed Sheeran heard it, that's my truth."" Asked if he was accusing the star of lying under oath, he responded: ""I'm not sure if he lied or he doesn't remember."" Giving evidence last week, Sheeran said he originally wrote Shape Of You for Little Mix In his witness statement, Mr Chokri said he had written Oh Why in June 2014 at a time when he was ""truly in pain"". ""I remember specifically that I was drinking some wine that day whilst we were writing and recording,"" he wrote. ""I was saying, 'Why do I keep putting myself back in this place?' ""I recall singing to Ross [O'Donoghue, his co-writer], 'Oh why, Oh why, Oh why?' and Ross saying something along the lines of, 'That's It! Let's work on that'. ""The song really resonated because it was a little bit different to anything else that I had made."" Mr Chokri later tried to get Sheeran to listen to the song ""as I was inspired by his success and stardom and his endorsement would be a significant boost"". To increase his chances, he sent an EP that included Oh Why to several people in Sheeran's circle, including producer Adam Coltman, musician Jake Roche and Jamal Edwards. Giving evidence, Mr Chokri said he was certain that one of them would have played it to the star - but ""I can't tell you exactly which because I don't know"". Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, suggested that Oh Why was itself inspired byEd Sheeran's cover of the Johnny Cash song The Wayfaring Stranger.,external ""I doubt it,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""That was a life-changing day for me. I wasn't thinking about Ed Sheeran, I was thinking about staying alive."" He acknowledged being a fan of Mr Sheeran's work, and The Wayfaring Stranger in particular. ""I definitely appreciated his work,"" he said, ""but I've got a bitter taste in my mouth since he stole a part of my song."" Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue first accused Sheeran and his copying their song in 2018. The trio denied the claims and launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed any copyright. Several months later, Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue issued their own claim for ""copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement"". In court, Sheeran's lawyer noted that Mr Chokri had not registered Oh Why with music rights body the PRS until April 2017 - three months after Shape Of You was released. ""The fact you weren't registered is indicative of the fact you weren't earning money"" from the song, he said. ""My main focus... was to get my name out there,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""I didn't think about money at all."" Mr Mill suggested the real reason for registering the song was so Mr Chokri could pursue his copyright claim. ""I was advised that would be the next step,"" he told the court, but ""didn't know that signing up to PRS was for that purpose"". An estimated Â£20m in royalty payments has been frozen since that point. The trial continues. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The arrivals process into England is set to become easier for travellers The transport secretary has confirmed that all remaining Covid travel measures will be scrapped. Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive. Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving. Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday. His announcement means that passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer have to take Covid tests before and after travelling to the UK. The passenger locator form will no longer be necessary either. People planning an overseas trip will still need to be aware of other countries' entry rules. Mr Shapps tweeted: ""These changes are possible due to our vaccine rollout and mean greater freedom in time for Easter."" When any new Covid strains appear in the future, the government said its default approach would be to use ""the least-stringent measures"" for restricting travel. Its ""Living with Covid"" plan said new measures at the border would only be considered in ""extreme circumstances"". It said the UKHSA would closely monitor the prevalence and spread of Covid variants. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans? Scotland and Wales have agreed to follow England in scrapping the remaining coronavirus border measures. But Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so ""reluctantly"" - and was ""extremely disappointed"" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched. The Scottish government said consistency across the four nations was agreed because of the ""negative impact of non-alignment on the tourism industry"". Testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals into the UK were dropped in February. The latest move was welcomed by some figures in the travel industry, which has campaigned forthe remaining rules to be droppedso businesses can take full advantage of strong summer holiday demand. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: ""Today's announcement sends a clear message to the world - the UK travel sector is back. ""With travellers returning to the UK no longer burdened by unnecessary forms and testing requirements, we can now look forward to the return to pre-Covid normality throughout the travel experience."" A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""The removal of all remaining UK travel restrictions is the final important step towards frictionless air travel, helping to further restore consumer confidence as we welcome more customers back to the skies this spring and summer. ""To uphold the experience of all travellers, it's vital that the UK Government works closely with industry to ensure the UK border is ready for increasing passengers, as international travel ramps up."" Meanwhile, Eurostar's chief executive Jacques Damas said the easing of restrictions would help the cross-Channel train operator's recovery. ""We hope and expect to see the UK's approach replicated across our other markets in the coming weeks,"" Mr Damas said. However, as Covid restrictions recede, other headwinds for the aviation industry are appearing. The price of jet fuel has soared as a result of higher crude oil prices. This adds to cost pressures on airlines, although some have been protected by their hedging strategies, whereby they purchased fuel in advance at lower prices. On Friday, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, said the recovery of aviation remained ""overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"".

"More than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, the UN estimates There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainian refugees who can live with UK host families under a new visa scheme, the government has confirmed. It is hoped tens of thousands of displaced people will benefit from the Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme. More details will be set out later, before a website goes live for people to express an interest in helping. Hosts will receive Â£350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast there would be ""no cap"" on the number of people who can be supported through the scheme. ""I'm pleased that we're doing this because as a country we have a very proud record of offering sanctuary to people from wars and from conflicts,"" he added. The government hasso far faced criticism - including from its own MPs- over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee Under the new scheme people in the UK will be able to nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free, either in their own home or in another property, for at least six months. Hosts are not required to personally know the refugee they want to host. They will be matched with those seeking refuge in the UK after submitting a form. Mr Javid said once refugees arrive they will be allowed to stay in the UK ""for at least three years"". They will have access to the NHS and other public services, and their children will be able to attend local schools. Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age. Applications to host refugees will be made online and both hosts and refugees will be vetted. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove will make a statement in Parliament later to set out further details. Asked if he might host a Ukrainian family himself, Mr Javid said it was something he and his wife were ""starting to have a conversation"" about. ""Whatever I do at a personal level, I most certainly will be helping,"" he added. The first hosts and refugees will be matched this week, allowing the first Ukrainians to arrive in the UK through this route in about two weeks' time, the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming says. Maxine Taylor says she's got spare time and space to host two or three refugees One of those hoping to help through the new scheme is Maxine Taylor, who lives alone in a four-bedroom house in Godalming, Surrey. Maxine, who is self-employed and works part-time, says the ""peace and quiet"" of her more rural home might be a better option for traumatised refugees than a busy city. But she does want more information from the government about the scheme - such as whether or not hosts will be taxed on the Â£350 monthly payment, and how the matching service will work. She also wants to make sure anyone she takes in gets the mental health support they will need after fleeing a war zone. Maxine says she's been wanting to find a way to help Ukrainians ""since day one"" of the invasion, and has felt ""frustrated"" that the government's visa schemes have been ""so slow"" to get off the ground. My hopes to host refugees delayed by UK government ""I've just been absolutely horrified by what's going on,"" Maxine says, adding that seeing images of young women and men signing up to fight for their country has ""really touched me"". ""I just feel I'd like to do my bit... we've got to help."" Organisations such as charities andÂ churches will eventually be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this phase of the scheme yet. Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out. The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them. Some 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show. The Home Officehas defended,externalrequiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it's seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian. Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the UK's plans to help those fleeing Ukraine have been ""embarrassing"" compared with those of other countries. He told Good Morning Britain that people, businesses and councils were ""ready to step up"" and welcome refugees but the system to do so has been ""far too complicated"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously described the Home Office's response as ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for ""incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity"" in leading the response. The NSPCC said it had concerns about safety checks on prospective hosts through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The children's charity said it was ""vital child protection is built into every stage of the government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"". Asked aboutthe bombing of a maternity and children's hospitalin the city of Mariupol last week, Mr Javid said Russia had made some 31 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since its invasion. ""These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,"" he said. In a visit to the Hague on Monday, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would give financial and technical support to the International Criminal Court to help it investigate the situation in Ukraine. He said it was vital to ensure anyone who committed war crimes was held to account and that commanders on the ground, as well as the Kremlin, ""need to know that right now"". Meanwhile,21 Ukrainian children with cancerhave arrived in the UK to receive NHS treatment, the health secretary said. The children have been given six-month visas to get them out of Ukraine quickly but Mr Javid told Sky News these would be extended ""to at least three years"".

Boris Johnson pledged ""to pursue more options for bolstering Ukraine's self-defence"", No 10 said, and discussed efforts to end the war. The government is to send 500 portable electricity generators for use in facilities such as hospitals and shelters which have lost power following the invasion - something President Zelensky made a direct request for. Mr Johnson condemned the murders ofUS journalist Brent Renaudand countless innocent Ukrainians, Downing Street said. The prime minister is hosting a series of meetings with Nordic and Baltic leaders in London and Chequers this week. No 10 says he will urge them to work together to ensure no further nations fall victim to Vladimir Putin's aggression. Have you signed up for the Homes for Ukraine scheme?

"Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch Ed Sheeran ""belittled"" a songwriter who accused him of stealing one of his songs, London's High Court has heard. Sami Chokri says he was hurt by the tone of Sheeran's lawyers' emails after he noticed similarities between his song Oh Why and Sheeran's Shape Of You. ""I feel like I've been robbed by someone I respect, or respected,"" he told the court. ""This is years of a cloud over my head. All I heard and read was emails belittling me and my questions."" He continued: ""All I wanted to do was ask for an explanation. If I'd had one we wouldn't have had to go through with this rubbish."" He later called the trial ""the most horrible few weeks of my life"". Mr Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, says the ""oh I, oh I, oh I,"" hook on Shape Of You is ""strikingly similar"" to the chorus of his song, which was released two years earlier. In a witness statement, he said he first became aware of the alleged plagiarism in 2017. ""I was a passenger in my girlfriend's car and Shape Of You came on the radio,"" he wrote. ""She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities. Mr Chokri later put out a Facebook post saying, ""Anyone else think Ed Sheeran's new song Shape Of You chorus sounds familiar lol?"" ""I had lots of responses,"" he said, including one from Sheeran's friend Jamal Edwards featuring the ""shifty eyes"" emoji - which was later deleted. ""I thought maybe he had played a part in showing [my song] to Ed,"" Mr Chokri told the court. ""I had no reason to ever consider it coming to circumstances like these."" Before his death last month, Mr Edwards gave a written statement in which he denied playing Oh Why to Sheeran. ""Even if I was sent a copy, I did not share it with Ed,"" he wrote. ""I respect what Jamal says,"" Mr Chokri responded in court, ""but I also believe that Jamal would share music with Ed Sheeran."" Sheeran and his co-writers Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac have all denied copying Oh Why. Last week, Sheeran told the court that the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He added: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Giving evidence on Monday, Mr Chokri disputed the star's claim, saying: ""I believe Ed Sheeran heard it, that's my truth."" Asked if he was accusing the star of lying under oath, he responded: ""I'm not sure if he lied or he doesn't remember."" Giving evidence last week, Sheeran said he originally wrote Shape Of You for Little Mix In his witness statement, Mr Chokri said he had written Oh Why in June 2014 at a time when he was ""truly in pain"". ""I remember specifically that I was drinking some wine that day whilst we were writing and recording,"" he wrote. ""I was saying, 'Why do I keep putting myself back in this place?' ""I recall singing to Ross [O'Donoghue, his co-writer], 'Oh why, Oh why, Oh why?' and Ross saying something along the lines of, 'That's It! Let's work on that'. ""The song really resonated because it was a little bit different to anything else that I had made."" Mr Chokri later tried to get Sheeran to listen to the song ""as I was inspired by his success and stardom and his endorsement would be a significant boost"". To increase his chances, he sent an EP that included Oh Why to several people in Sheeran's circle, including producer Adam Coltman, musician Jake Roche and Jamal Edwards. Giving evidence, Mr Chokri said he was certain that one of them would have played it to the star - but ""I can't tell you exactly which because I don't know"". Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, suggested that Oh Why was itself inspired byEd Sheeran's cover of the Johnny Cash song The Wayfaring Stranger.,external ""I doubt it,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""That was a life-changing day for me. I wasn't thinking about Ed Sheeran, I was thinking about staying alive."" He acknowledged being a fan of Mr Sheeran's work, and The Wayfaring Stranger in particular. ""I definitely appreciated his work,"" he said, ""but I've got a bitter taste in my mouth since he stole a part of my song."" Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue first accused Sheeran and his copying their song in 2018. The trio denied the claims and launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed any copyright. Several months later, Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue issued their own claim for ""copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement"". In court, Sheeran's lawyer noted that Mr Chokri had not registered Oh Why with music rights body the PRS until April 2017 - three months after Shape Of You was released. ""The fact you weren't registered is indicative of the fact you weren't earning money"" from the song, he said. ""My main focus... was to get my name out there,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""I didn't think about money at all."" Mr Mill suggested the real reason for registering the song was so Mr Chokri could pursue his copyright claim. ""I was advised that would be the next step,"" he told the court, but ""didn't know that signing up to PRS was for that purpose"". An estimated Â£20m in royalty payments has been frozen since that point. The trial continues. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The aftermath of Russian artillery shelling on a residential area in Mariupol, 10 March The Russian bombardment of some places in Ukraine is so intense that towns and cities are being forced to unceremoniously bury dozens of civilian victims in mass graves. Nowhere is this grim reality of war more apparent than inMariupol, a key port city devastated by constant shelling, where several burial sites have been hastily dug in the past two weeks. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC by phone. Locations include a retired city cemetery that has now been re-opened, Mr Orlov said. Warning: This article contains images that some may find upsetting On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had risen above 2,100. The heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from Mariupol, despite efforts to open a safe exit route. Mr Orlov could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but said 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents."" Thousands of residents are hiding in cellars and in some cases, he said, people are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens. The battered city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting bodies in the streets, he said, as municipal services had collapsed. ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days,"" he said. Four-hundred miles to the north west, on the edge of the capital Kyiv, a mass grave was dug near a church in the town ofBucha, local MP Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska said. It contains more than 60 bodies. Video of the burial was posted on Facebook by a doctor working in nearby Irpin, Andriy Levkivsky. Doctors buried the victims, who had been brought to Irpin hospital. Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska told the BBC that a ""ritual service"" was conducted at the hospital before burial. Not all had been identified and ""nobody knows exactly where the relatives are,"" she said. ""Now we're discussing with volunteers how to create a digital system to identify people and trace missing relatives,"" she said. Russian troops captured the hospital on Saturday and told the doctors to leave, she said, speaking by phone from western Ukraine. Bucha and half of Irpin are now in Russian hands, she said. The return of mass graves is a shock for Ukrainians. Many have bitter family memories of World War Two, when Jews and Soviet partisans were murdered by Nazis, and the Holodomor - the famine created in Ukraine by Soviet seizure of grain and livestock in the 1930s. ""My uncle is 92 and even he compared it with his childhood in the war,"" said Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska, who emphasised it is ""important for us to bury relatives traditionally, the Christian way, with praying"". ""Even now in war people sometimes ask priests to do that,"" she said. A mass grave in Bucha - still from video posted by Dr Levkivsky In northern Ukraine the cities of Kharkiv,Chernihivand Sumy are surrounded by Russian troops and relentless shelling has killed many civilians there too. On 6 March Oleksandra Matviichuk, a civil liberties campaigner,tweeted,externala photo of coffins in a trench, accompanied by the message: ""Thus, civilians killed in the Russian bombing of Chernihiv are buried in trenches. Since the main city cemetery in Yatsevo is under constant shelling by the Russian occupiers, the victims are buried in the Yalivshchyna forest."" Oleksandr Lomako, secretary of Chernihiv city council, told the BBC that victims of Russian air raids and shelling were being buried in a temporary cemetery. He confirmed that the city's main cemetery was now inaccessible, with Russian troops surrounding the city on three sides, the nearest about 10km (six miles) away. Coffins buried in a trench in Chernihiv - photograph courtesy of mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko ""After the war we will rebury the dead,"" he said, estimating the city's civilian death toll in the Russian bombardment to be about 200. One air raid killed 45 people in Chernihiv - the worst toll, Mr Lomako said - adding that nightly bombing was killing seven civilians on average. ""The planes drop three to four bombs on residential blocks. Also one hit the hospital, but it is still working. Dozens of housing blocks have been destroyed on the edge of the city."" As well as evidence of mass burials, there are accounts of makeshift graves. A mother and son were buried in the courtyard of their new apartment block in Irpin, which has been heavily shelled by the Russians. A photo of the grave was widely shared by Ukrainians, anda tweet,externalby journalist Olga Rudenko showed Marina Met and her son Ivan enjoying life in Kyiv before the invasion. Makeshift grave of a mother and son in Irpin For those whose loved ones have suffered the effects of siege and shelling at the hands of invading forces, burial in makeshift graves will no doubt feel like the final indignity.

In a statement, the IAEA said that while Ukraine reported on Sunday that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine's power grid, transmission system operator Ukrenergo later said it had again been damaged ""by the occupying forces"". Power, however, was restored at around 13:10 local time (12:10 GMT). IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi said that the power issues at the plant ""underline the urgency"" of an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to regulate their nuclear sites. The IAEA said it is also looking into reporters that Russian forces ""have carried out munition explosions"" at Europe's largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhya plant. Allow Twitter content?

If you're just joining us, here's some of the latest developments from Russia's invasion of Ukraine: US officials believe Russian ballistic missiles being
fired into Ukraine are equipped with a previously unknown decoy device that
allows them to avoid interception, according to the New York Times. Citing an unnamed US official, the Times reported that the
devices â attached to Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles â are each about
a foot-long and contain equipment that produces radio signals to jam radar
detection. Additionally, each device contains a heat source to attract
incoming missiles. The US official told the Times that similar ""penetration
aids"" have been used on nuclear warheads since the 1970s. Various images of the devices have been shared on social
media by weapons and munitions experts who had been unable to identify them. Earlier on Monday, a senior US defence official told
reporters Russia has launched 900 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine
began on 24 February. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg Japan's finance ministry has frozen the assets of more Russian individuals over the country's invasion of Ukraine. It has sanctioned,external11 members of the State Duma, a chamber of Russia's Parliament, five relatives of banker Yuri Kovalchuk and billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. This brings the number of Russians who have been targeted by Japanese sanctions to 61, the ministry said. New Zealand Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi in December New Zealand plans to take in 4,000 relatives of Ukrainian-born New Zealand citizens and residents, Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi has announced. ""This is the largest special visa category we have established in decades to support an international humanitarian effort,"" Faafoi said. The initiative will be open for one year. Successful applicants will be granted two-year visas with work rights, and their children will be allowed to attend schools in New Zealand. Faafoi said the programme would allow ""the estimated 1,600 Ukrainian-born citizens and residents in New Zealand to sponsor parents, grandparents and adult siblings or adult children and their immediate family who are ordinarily resident in Ukraine to shelter safely here"". More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Dvorkovich, seated on Putin's right side, during a meeting in 2018 Arkady Dvorkovich, the head of the World Chess Organization (FIDE), who served as Russia's Deputy Prime Minister from 2012-18, has condemned the war in an interview with a US publication,Mother Jones,external. ""Wars are the worst thing in life. Any wars. Anywhere. Including this war,"" he said from an undisclosed location inside Russia. ""Wars do not just take precious lives. Wars take away dreams and aspirations, freeze and destroy relationships and ties."" Earlier this month, FIDE officials unanimously condemned Russia for its invasion, and banned Russia and Belarus from competition. It also stripped the title of ambassador for life from former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov, a current Russian MP who voted in the State Duma for recognition of two separatist-backed regions of eastern Ukraine. Several Ukrainian chess players have also criticised Dvorkovich for his previous work for the Russian government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says peace talks with Russia - now in their fourth round - will continue on Tuesday in Turkey. Releasing a video address on Facebook, he said he was informed that talks have been going ""pretty good"". ""But let's see. They will continue tomorrow,"" he said. He added that Ukrainian forces were able to help 3,806 people flee from the Luhansk and Kyiv regions on Monday. A convoy of 100 tonnes of supplies was still stuck in Berdyansk, he said, unable to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol. He added that Russian troops were ""confused"" and ""did not expect such resistance"" from Ukraine. ""They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment"" he claimed. ""We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare."" Zelensky also thanked Russian civilians who have protested and sought to spread the truth about the war - paying his personal thanks to a protester who held up an anti-war sign on Russia's Channel One news earlier on Monday. Pedestrians walk among anti-tank barriers in Odesa on Monday The latest intelligence assessment from the UK Ministry of Defense says that Russia is baselessly continuing to accuse Ukraine of intending to commit a chemical or biological attack. Russia, the MoD bulletin says without citing evidence, ""could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a false flag operation"". The operation ""could"" take the form of a failed attack, a staged discovery of Ukrainian agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian government decision-making. It ""would almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution"", the ministry said on Twitter. A false flag is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it. Read more about the history of false flag operations here: False flags: What are they and when have they been used? A Ukrainian armour repair plant pictured in 2014 Russia's defence ministry says it will target Ukrainian defence industry companies in response to what it describes as a Ukrainian ballistic missile attack on the separatist stronghold of Donetsk earlier on Monday. In an onlinepost,external, the Russian defence ministry writes: ""In response to the shelling of Donetsk with a Tochka-U missile, Russian armed forces will take operational measures to put out of use Ukrainian defence industry enterprises which produce weapons used by the nationalists. ""We call on Ukrainian citizens who work at these enterprises, as well as residents of nearby houses, to leave the potentially dangerous areas."" Moscow earlier alleged 20 civilians had died in a Ukrainian air strike on Donetsk, involving cluster munitions carried by a Tochka-U ballistic missile. Ukraine denied carrying out the attack and claimed a Russian missile was responsible. This is the second time Russia has warned of a strike against Ukrainian facilities. After the first such warning on 1 March, at least five people died in anattack targeting the Kyiv TV tower. US President Joe Biden has vowed to continue supplying weapons, food and money to help Ukraine. In a tweet, Biden said the US would also ""welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms"". Earlier on Monday, Biden said the US was providing ""tens of thousands of tons of humanitarian supplies"" on a daily basis. On Friday, Biden signed an emergency spending package that earmarked $13.6bn in aid for Ukraine, about half of which was for military aid. On Monday, CNN also reported the Biden administration was considering expediting immigration proceedings for displaced Ukrainians with ties to the US. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters in London briefly seized a building thought to belong to a Putin ally on Monday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new sanctions on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, the BBC has learned. This is to be implemented via emergency legislation as part of the Economic Crime Bill, which has just passed the UK Parliament. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet that he and his Canadian counterpart MÃ©lanie Joly (pictured) agreed sanctions against Russia should be increased Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says he held a call with Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs MÃ©lanie Joly to discuss ""ways to stop Russian aggression"" against Ukraine. In a tweet, Kuleba said that he and Joly agreed that sanctions pressure on Russia will ""increase"". ""Canada supports Ukraine on all fronts,"" he added. On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced more sanctions on five Russian citizens - including Roman Abramovich - and said 32 Russian companies and government entities would be barred from receiving defence equipment or supplies. Trudeau also said the Canadian government was looking at a number of options to help Ukrainian citizens and wouldn't rule out an airlift. You'll Never Drink Alone were the words that hung above the bar at the Old Hem, an iconic pub in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. But the pub, named after legendary American writer Ernest Hemingway and popular among the city's young creatives, now lies in ruins. It was completely destroyed during Russian shelling of the city. The Kharkiv prosecutor's office says two people died in the attack. Site of the destroyed Old Hem pub in Kharkiv, Ukraine The bar's owner, Kostiantyn Kuts, told the BBC that no staff were in the bar when it was hit, and those who died were in apartments above. The Old Hem stopped pouring pints and turned into a makeshift bomb shelter when the Russian army invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Kuts says. He initially hoped he'd only be shutting briefly. President Putin has implemented a new law making it harder for foreign aircraft leasing companies to repossess their planes as Western sanctions begin to take effect. The new law will allow foreign jets to be registered in Russia ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". Critics say it will allow Russia to seize privately-owned planes and put them to domestic use in the vast country. Russian airlines have 515 jets leased from abroad worth about $10bn (Â£7.7bn). Foreign owners have until 28 March to get them back from Russian companies before sanctions kick in. But, as BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett explains, it's one thing to steal aircraft, it's quite another to keep them operating for any length of time. If Russia does go ahead and seize foreign owned planes, it will immediately struggle to maintain them.

""We are working around the clock to obtain respective support or purchase the required weaponry,"" Oleksiy Reznikov writes in a Facebook post. ""Our defenders, our brave men and women are continuing to inflict significant losses on the Russian invaders every single day,"" he says. ""Our army, national and border guards, soldiers from all defence sectors are constantly sending these uninvited guests back home."" Reznikov goes on to say that the Ukrainian army is ""among the best in the world and the strongest in Europe"".

Before the stunt, which was broadcast live on Russia's Channel One, protester Marina Ovsyannikova recorded a video in which she called events in Ukraine a ""crime"". ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" Ovsyannikova, an editor at the channel, explained. She called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying that only they could ""stop the madness"". Ovsyannikova is now in police custody. Pro-Ukraine demonstrators outside the ICJ in the Hague on 7 March The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague has said it will rule on Wednesday on a case brought by Ukraine against Russia, accusing it of falsely justifying its invasion. Ukraine filed the case soon after the Russian invasion on 24 February. It accuses Russia of using false claims that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide in separatist-held areas of the Donbas region as a pretext to attack. Russian officials did not appear at an earlier hearing at the UN's World Court on 7 March. In a statement, the ICJ said that the court will deliver its order at 1600 local time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, 16 March. A separate war crimes investigation has also been launched by the International Criminal Court to look into allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine. We reported earlier about a missile strike in the separatist-controlled Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, which Russia claimed - without providing evidence - was launched by Ukrainian forces. Now Ukraine's defence ministry is saying that it was ""undoubtedly a Russian missile"", according to local media. ""There's not even any point talking about it,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said during a televised address, accusing Russia of using the strike as ""propaganda"". Russian media reported earlier that a Ukrainian missile hit the centre of Donetsk, killing 20 people and injuring several more, and accused Kyiv of committing a war crime. Donetsk is one of the rebel-held separatist areas where fighting against Ukrainian forces has been taking place since 2014. Brent Renaud, 50, was a journalist and filmmaker and was shot dead in the town of Irpin, outside Kyiv. He had been working in the region at the time of his death. Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital. It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine. Renaud had reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti. He won a Peabody Award for his work on a 2014 series on Chicago schools, Last Chance High. He often worked alongside his brother, Craig, also a filmmaker. It is not known whether Craig also travelled to Ukraine. Photographs are circulating online showing a press ID for Renaud issued by the New York Times. In a statement, the newspaper said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Renaud's death but that he had not been working for the newspaper in Ukraine. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A pregnant woman wounded in the Russian bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital has died along with her baby, reports say. Images showed her on a stretcher following the air strike in Mariupol last Wednesday, in which at least three other people were killed. After the place where she was meant to give birth was attacked, she was taken to another hospital. Her baby was born by Caesarean section, but showed no signs of life. The surgeon, Timur Marin, told the Associated Press news agency that the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics said that as they were trying to save her life, she realised she was losing her baby and shouted, ""Kill me now!"" When it became clear to them that the child was stillborn, they tried to resuscitate the mother, but realised after 30 minutes that it was hopeless. Doctors said they did not have time to take the woman's name before her husband and father came to retrieve her body. That meant she did not end up in one of the mass graves being dug for victims of the Russian shelling of the city, they added. After the bombing of the hospital,Twitter removed two posts by the Russian embassy in Londonwhich claimed the attack had been faked. The embassy's tweets made unfounded claims that the hospital was not operational at the time and that injured women pictured at the scene were actors. The embassy also cast aspersions on another pregnant woman, photographed escaping from the wreckage of the hospital, who gave birth the day after the bombing. The image of Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack. In response to assertions that she was not actually pregnant, the BBC's disinformation team found evidence that contradicted the allegations.

"Fewer people are commuting to work even after work-from-home guidance was lifted Jobs on the railways ""will need to change to become more passenger-centric"", according to the group that represents train operators. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) was responding to reports that hundreds of rail ticket offices could potentially close as part of a plan to modernise the railways. RDG said it is talking to unions about how to address job changes. One union said it will ballot staff if compulsory redundancies are used. A spokesperson for the RDG, which represents the rail industry, said: ""The pandemic has been an unprecedented financial shock to the railway. ""While no decisions have been taken over ticket offices, with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology, many jobs will need to change to become more passenger-centric. ""Train companies are working with unions on how to address those changes, while making sure the industry takes no more than its fair share from the taxpayer,"" they added. The bosses of rail operators are in talks with the government about the closures, which may result in redundancies if staff cannot be moved into other roles, theSunday Times reported,external. During the pandemic, train passenger numbers collapsed and so did revenues. Living costs rising at their fastest rate for 30 years Air fares rise are unavoidable, warns airline boss Mayors call on government to reassess rail plans Passengers numbers are still recovering, with big changes such as hybrid working affecting commuter levels and season ticket sales. To ensure the railways kept running during the pandemic, the government stepped in to finance the industry. Recently, rail minister Wendy Morton told the BBC that taxpayers had supported the railways with more than Â£14bn of funding, and that taxpayers had to get a good return on what they had invested. As part of plans to modernise the railways, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps committed to modernising ticketing with more digitisation, as part of theWilliams-Shapps plan for rail. Train tickets purchased online can be collected at self-service kiosks in train stations Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said: ""Grant Shapps needs to realise that this daft plan is likely to result in the threat of compulsory redundancies, and if that happens we will be issuing ballots for industrial action. ""Closing ticket offices will not only be opposed by the unions but the public at large. ""Shapps must stand up to the faceless accountants in the Treasury because a properly run and fully functioning railway is vital in building an economic recovery from Covid. ""The government should share their plans in detail with us and commuters now if they are so sure that closing ticket offices and taking Â£2bn a year out of our railways is the best way forward. ""I'd strongly urge them to reconsider,"" Mr Cortes added. Railway ticket offices are run by train operating companies in different stations, and not by Network Rail.

"A group of children including toddlers and teenagers take part in a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland The kicks are high and the punches straight, but the Ukrainian children here are delivering them in an environment of peace: a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland. The 14 students are given the basic moves by a Polish teacher, who ensures there's plenty of laughter. For this hour at least, the trauma they've gone through in the past fortnight is replaced by enjoyment. Some of them have family back at home fighting for real. Fourteen-year-old Dariy Gulyk hasn't heard from his father for three days and is worried. The emotions make it hard to feel settled here. ""In Poland, it's very cool"", he says, ""but we want to go home - because home is home."" His cousin, Sasha Minaiev, 17, appreciates the temporary distraction. ""When we're in the karate class, we forget about the war in that moment"", he says, ""but when it ends, we remember again, and we understand we must do all we can to help our people in Ukraine."" The old centre of Zamosc is a Unesco World Heritage site The class takes place in the small eastern Polish town of Zamosc, population 60,000. Its beautiful old centre, a Unesco World Heritage site, is dotted with Renaissance churches and coloured facades: a far cry from the horror unfolding across the border. It, like many others across Poland, has been transformed in the past two weeks into a refugee hub. On some days, up to 35,000 people have arrived - most going on further west but some staying. Around a thousand beds have been provided at the reception centre, schools, private homes and even the sports club where the karate class takes place. The mayor, Andrzej Wnuk, says it's a huge strain on Zamosc, warning that the welcome has its limits. ""Polish people seem infinitely ready to give, but it will end one day"", he says. ""We thought there would be a first wave of refugees and then we would get significant support from the government and the EU but it turns out we were left alone. We need financial help or the quality of our hospitality will drop drastically."" The impulse in Zamosc to offer refuge is partly due to its history as a place that has known the cost of oppression. Almost half of its pre-war population, some 12,000 people, were Jews. During occupation first by the Soviets and then the Nazis, most were sent to the ghetto here and then to concentration camps. A monument to the tragedy, made from the headstones in the town's old Jewish cemetery, stands on the outskirts. The locals here are proud of their heritage of hospitality, extended to the new arrivals. The restaurant at the Renesans hotel is now only cooking for refugees. In the kitchen, pots of Ukrainian beetroot soup and fruit compote bubble away, as staff box up portions of pork ribs and pasta. The owner, Damian Poterucha, says as a father, it was a natural decision to change his business once he saw the children fleeing the war. ""I can't believe Polish people are responding like this"", he says, ""it's nice to see."" But he says he's running short of money and can only continue offering the handouts for another two weeks. ""After that, I will think about what I can do next"", he adds. Damian Poterucha now uses his hotel kitchen to prepare food for refugees The food is delivered to the main shelter, where some 300 volunteers help out. All the while, buses arrive with new arrivals - and others leave, taking those on board to larger cities in the west, where many of the refugees have friends or family. ""We need help from the world"", says Barbara Godziszewska, a town hall employee now helping to serve hot food. ""Everybody looks at us and gives us a 'bravo', but it's too small - someone needs to tell us what we can do with the refugees. If the numbers continue like this, I'm afraid maybe they'll go on the street to sleep because every hotel is full."" In the space of a fortnight, Poland has gone from rejecting migrants from the Middle East to opening its arms to those from Ukraine. There is discomfort among some Poles with what appears to be a volte-face by their government, from pushing away the mainly Muslim men of Syria to welcoming the predominantly white, Christian women and children of Ukraine. But Poland's migration policy will be pored over by historians in future years. For now, the focus is on the present influx. And as the fighting worsens in Ukraine - and begins to spread to the west - towns like Zamosc are wondering how long they can cope.

"More than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, the UN estimates There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainian refugees who can live with UK host families under a new visa scheme, the government has confirmed. It is hoped tens of thousands of displaced people will benefit from the Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme. More details will be set out later, before a website goes live for people to express an interest in helping. Hosts will receive Â£350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast there would be ""no cap"" on the number of people who can be supported through the scheme. ""I'm pleased that we're doing this because as a country we have a very proud record of offering sanctuary to people from wars and from conflicts,"" he added. The government hasso far faced criticism - including from its own MPs- over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee Under the new scheme people in the UK will be able to nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free, either in their own home or in another property, for at least six months. Hosts are not required to personally know the refugee they want to host. They will be matched with those seeking refuge in the UK after submitting a form. Mr Javid said once refugees arrive they will be allowed to stay in the UK ""for at least three years"". They will have access to the NHS and other public services, and their children will be able to attend local schools. Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age. Applications to host refugees will be made online and both hosts and refugees will be vetted. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove will make a statement in Parliament later to set out further details. Asked if he might host a Ukrainian family himself, Mr Javid said it was something he and his wife were ""starting to have a conversation"" about. ""Whatever I do at a personal level, I most certainly will be helping,"" he added. The first hosts and refugees will be matched this week, allowing the first Ukrainians to arrive in the UK through this route in about two weeks' time, the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming says. Maxine Taylor says she's got spare time and space to host two or three refugees One of those hoping to help through the new scheme is Maxine Taylor, who lives alone in a four-bedroom house in Godalming, Surrey. Maxine, who is self-employed and works part-time, says the ""peace and quiet"" of her more rural home might be a better option for traumatised refugees than a busy city. But she does want more information from the government about the scheme - such as whether or not hosts will be taxed on the Â£350 monthly payment, and how the matching service will work. She also wants to make sure anyone she takes in gets the mental health support they will need after fleeing a war zone. Maxine says she's been wanting to find a way to help Ukrainians ""since day one"" of the invasion, and has felt ""frustrated"" that the government's visa schemes have been ""so slow"" to get off the ground. My hopes to host refugees delayed by UK government ""I've just been absolutely horrified by what's going on,"" Maxine says, adding that seeing images of young women and men signing up to fight for their country has ""really touched me"". ""I just feel I'd like to do my bit... we've got to help."" Organisations such as charities andÂ churches will eventually be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this phase of the scheme yet. Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out. The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them. Some 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show. The Home Officehas defended,externalrequiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it's seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian. Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the UK's plans to help those fleeing Ukraine have been ""embarrassing"" compared with those of other countries. He told Good Morning Britain that people, businesses and councils were ""ready to step up"" and welcome refugees but the system to do so has been ""far too complicated"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously described the Home Office's response as ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for ""incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity"" in leading the response. The NSPCC said it had concerns about safety checks on prospective hosts through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The children's charity said it was ""vital child protection is built into every stage of the government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"". Asked aboutthe bombing of a maternity and children's hospitalin the city of Mariupol last week, Mr Javid said Russia had made some 31 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since its invasion. ""These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,"" he said. In a visit to the Hague on Monday, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would give financial and technical support to the International Criminal Court to help it investigate the situation in Ukraine. He said it was vital to ensure anyone who committed war crimes was held to account and that commanders on the ground, as well as the Kremlin, ""need to know that right now"". Meanwhile,21 Ukrainian children with cancerhave arrived in the UK to receive NHS treatment, the health secretary said. The children have been given six-month visas to get them out of Ukraine quickly but Mr Javid told Sky News these would be extended ""to at least three years"". LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby FAKES:How to spot false posts from Ukraine WATCH:Five times refugees were met with kindness RUSSIA:The impact of sanctions on daily life IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Elsewhere, the prime minister spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday night. Boris Johnson pledged ""to pursue more options for bolstering Ukraine's self-defence"", No 10 said, and discussed efforts to end the war. The government is to send 500 portable electricity generators for use in facilities such as hospitals and shelters which have lost power following the invasion - something President Zelensky made a direct request for. Mr Johnson condemned the murders ofUS journalist Brent Renaudand countless innocent Ukrainians, Downing Street said. The prime minister is hosting a series of meetings with Nordic and Baltic leaders in London and Chequers this week. No 10 says he will urge them to work together to ensure no further nations fall victim to Vladimir Putin's aggression. Have you signed up for the Homes for Ukraine scheme?

"US President Joe Biden and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin held a virtual meeting on St Patrick's Day last year Two Stormont ministers will fly to the US this week ahead of the St Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington. Finance Minister Conor Murphy and Economy Minister Gordon Lyons are due to take part in a series of trade and investment events before attending the annual ceremony at the White House. Civil service head Jayne Brady and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill will join them. Washington's St Patrick's Day events have been cancelled for the past two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some restrictions, including face coverings, remain in place for White House events. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin will also be in Washington. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said it regretted that its leader Doug Beattie was ""too unwell to travel to Washington"" on this occasion. ""We wish those attending this week`s events a happy St Patrick`s Day and we look forward to taking up future invitations and opportunities to engage directly with the US administration,"" a UUP spokesperson added. After a two-year absence, the Irish political exodus on St Patrick's Day has returned with 33 Dublin ministers flying around the world. But there will be no first or deputy first minister from Northern Ireland. Their absence will be noted and used by some to talk up the the crisis at Stormont. But any debate will be completely overshadowed by the war in Ukraine and it will be Putin and notthe protocolwhich will dominate discussions. The programme in Washington will include the traditional Northern Ireland Bureau breakfast on St Patrick's Day. At the same time, US Vice President Kamala Harris will host a breakfast gathering before the annual speakers' luncheon with Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. The traditional shamrock handover between the taoiseach and US President Joe Biden will take place in the oval office. On Tuesday, politicians will gather at the Irish Embassy for the unveiling of a bust celebrating the life of former SDLP leader John Hume,who died in 2020. A bust will be unveiled in tribute to the late John Hume (left), pictured with President Clinton on St Patrick's Day in 2000 Before arriving in Washington, Mr Lyons will meet investors in New York along with representatives from the US travel industry. He will also travel to Maryland to meet officials from the US Department of Commerce to talk about a shared project on cyber security. The water in the White House north lawn fountain was turned green to mark St Patrick's Day in 2021 Although she is no longer deputy first minister, Michelle O'Neill will also be in the US with her Sinn FÃ©in party leader Mary Lou McDonald. They will attend an Irish unity event in New York before Ms McDonald addresses the US Council on Foreign Relations. It is not yet clear if other party leaders, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, plan to travel to Washington this week.

Ultimately though, England did not have enough runs on the board and - for the third game running - find themselves on the wrong side of a thrilling encounter. Heather Knight and co now need four wins from their last four games and other results to go their way if they are to reach the semi-finals. South Africa, on the other hand, have given themselves every chance of making the top four. England clawed their way back into contention, in no small part down to the brilliance of Sophie Ecclestone, and when Katherine Brunt got a fingertip on Marizanne Kapp's drive to run out Chloe Tryon, they might just have had the edge... This video can not be played 'That's never a nice way to go' Tryon run out at non-striker's end While cruising would be overstating it, South Africa were on track for victory before England finally held on to a catch to dismiss Wolvaardt for 77 and make it 158-4.... Nat Sciver got rid of Tazmin Brits but England were guilty of missing a number of opportunity, Wolvaardt often the beneficiary, with a missed stumping from Amy Jones added to a number of dropped catches...

South Africa captain Sune Luus on Sky Sports: ""We do our best when we are putting the opposition under pressure and we have a world class bowling attack so I felt like we could restrict them to a total that we could chase down.

She shows her class every time she steps on to the field and she is such an inspiration to young girls and boys out there. ""Lizelle hasn't played much cricket in the past few months so she's just finding her feet, we're not putting too much pressure on her. But I'm glad that everyone chipped in today, it was totally a team effort and I'm so proud of the girls. ""Regardless of what happens in the rest of the tournament, we have made history today and nothing is going to change that.

"Mr Sullivan, seen here in a file picture, warned that the US would not allow China to provide a ""lifeline"" to Russia China will face consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions in its invasion of Ukraine, the US says. Unnamed US officials told multiple news outlets that China had signalled willingness to provide military assistance to Russia. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation. Russia denied asking Beijing for military help. The exchanges came before top US and Chinese officials met in Rome. Media outlets, citing Washington officials, say that Russia has in recent days asked China specifically for military equipment, including drones. On Monday, the US warned allies that China had suggested it was open to a move to provide military and economic support, media reports said. The report came as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, for talks in Rome. ""Mr Sullivan raised a range of issues in US-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" a readout of the meeting said. ""They also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China."" In an earlier CNN interview, Mr Sullivan said the US was ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them"". ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said. He added that while the US believed China was aware that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was ""planning something"" before the invasion happened, Beijing ""may not have understood the full extent of it"". Russia's military action is now in its third week and has horrified much of the world ""Because it's very possible that [Mr] Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others,"" Mr Sullivan said. In response, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhao Lijian, said the US had ""been spreading disinformation targeting China on the Ukraine issue, with malicious intentions"". Asked if he could clarify whether China had received a request for military help from Russia, Mr Zhao said this was ""fake news"" but did not deny it directly. He added that China's stance had always been consistent and that China was playing a constructive role in promoting talks. President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports Russia had asked China for military assistance were not true. ""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full,"" he said. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US raised concerns with the Chinese delegation ""directly and very clearly"". China has so far refrained from condemning Russia for the invasion and has said Moscow's ""legitimate security concerns"" should be taken seriously. When the United Nations General Assembly voted to condemn Russia's invasion earlier this month, China was one of 35 countries that abstained. But Beijing at the same time has expressed ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty. It has also called for peace and has said it is ready to help end the war through diplomacy. Several countries have urged China to do more to stop Russia's invasion. The EU and US help Ukraine, China helps Russia; if that's how this goes, then it's a delineation that will make the war in Ukraine an even more consequential one. The White House has decided to make public its claim just as President Biden's top security adviser is due to meet China's most senior diplomat. It appears to be a tactical move, to put pressure on China; presumably to either confirm or deny it. The bigger aim could be to try to make Xi Jinping weigh up the pros and cons to his current position of what was last week called a ""rock solid"" relationship with Moscow. Remember that it was just weeks ago, as the Winter Olympics opened in Beijing, that Presidents Xi and Putin declared a new alliance that had ""no limit"". Military aid could, clearly, be part of that. But in the days after Russia's invasion China has condemned the UK, the US and others for giving weapons to Ukraine's military, saying they were adding ""fuel to the fire"". If the US intelligence assessment is correct and Beijing follows through on that request, then they too would be ""adding fuel"".

"China has always said repeatedly that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of others A month ago, Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared there was ""no limit"" to Beijing's newly strengthened relationship with Russia. He and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had met face-to-face in Beijing, culminating in a joint document - and then they went off to see the opening of the Winter Olympic Games. Days after the Games ended, Russia invaded Ukraine. China's government has neither condemned nor condoned the attack and has even refrained from calling it an ""invasion"" in the first place. It has always said that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of others, a core principle of its foreign policy. But earlier this week, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi signalled that it was ready to play a role in mediating a ceasefire. State media here reported that Mr Wang ""reaffirmed China's unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty"" and assured his counterpart of China's readiness to make every effort to end the war... through diplomacy"". China's government also recently expressed ""regret"" about the military action, saying it was extremely concerned about the harm to civilians. China has also done one other thing of note. Alongside India, it was one of 34 nations that abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion - something analysts say has come as a surprise. Many had expected China to vote alongside Russia. So, is it a sign of a shift in China's policy? It is more likely a sign that China is trying to strike a balance between the principle of respecting Ukraine's sovereignty while recognising what it describes as the ""legitimate security concerns"" of Russia. If you look back to the 5,000-word document signed off by Presidents Xi and Putin when they declared their deepening, unlimited alliance you'll see that objection to Nato expansion unites them, though the agreement covers multiple areas of common ground and planned co-operation; in space, in the Arctic, on Covid-19 vaccines. What is Nato and how is it responding to the Ukraine crisis? Why has Putin invaded Ukraine? The Ukraine crisis is a major challenge for China It is their shared vision of a future in which China and Russia work much more closely, for mutual benefit. The other key context to why China might stand fast in its support for Russia and Vladimir Putin - or its lack of condemnation, depending on how you see it - is Taiwan. The self-governing island, regarded as a rogue province by Beijing, is a place that President Xi wants to see ""reunited"" with his motherland. Were Mr Xi to do that by military force China would likely face a similar - or likely more serious - reaction from the US and its allies; condemnation, heightened sanctions, cultural exclusion. Taiwan is not Ukraine. If nothing else, the legal status of the two places is different. But in acknowledging what it calls Russia's ""legitimate security concerns"" and caveating the core principle of respecting sovereignty because of ""complex and unique historical context"", China's leader likely sees a future in which he can seek to justify to the world an ""invasion"" of Taiwan, and expect Russia's reciprocal support. And then there's the personal relationship between Mr Xi and Mr Putin. The two have met in person nearly 40 times now. When he arrived for the Winter Games last month, Russia's president was the most prominent leader by far to come to China since Covid-19 began. Both are autocratic leaders who share an ambition to deepen the ties and allegiance between their people and their ""motherland"". Xi Jinping sees a future where China - a vast economy - is more-self-reliant, decoupled to an extent from some of the global ties it has benefitted from. But the new ""no limit"" partnership with Russia may not mean an inevitable re-alignment away from the US, its allies and the established world order. It is, after all, an order in which China has sought to do more in recent years; on climate change, on peace keeping. And there are also the politics to consider. Not electoral politics, but the politics of association with a warring nation. China censors much of what its people can see and read but the severity of the war, which - more than any other conventional conflict - is being documented in often horrific detail, by the minute, on social media, may become an important factor in Beijing's calculations over its stance on Russia. Xi Jinping and the other senior leaders around him may conclude that there is, in fact, a limit to the relationship, and they need to step back - or step up and try to play the role of mediator with Moscow. A role that it told Ukraine it was prepared to take on, but which it has yet to show any sign of starting.
