"In the end the collected pressure from environmentalists, diplomats, major US corporations, foreign leaders, Mitt Romney, Leonardo Di Caprio and Ivanka Trump wasn't enough. The US is charting its own course, leaving the international community to fend for itself. The implications for that community, and the role of US leadership in it, will be the subject of considerable discussion in the days ahead. This decision was not made with international affairs in mind, however. It was one of domestic politics, pure and simple. If anything, the international community was the foil against which the president made a show of his dedication to the American people - putting Pittsburgh over Paris, as he phrased it. ""The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense,"" he said. ""They don't put America first. I do, and I always will."" Donald Trump campaigned on the economy, jobs and deregulation first and foremost. While he's had more than a few tweets and asides about climate change over the years - the ""Chinese hoax"" quote being the most publicised of the bunch - environmental issues hardly came up over the course of the campaign, either in debates or on the stump. On a sun-drenched Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden, it was more of the same. Despite a few throw-away lines about clean air and loving the environment, the president's speech was all about jobs and the economy; the ""unfairness"" of the agreement and the US as the object of international derision. This video can not be played Trump: The world won't laugh any more at US Traditionally, environmental issues have tended to rise in importance in the US during good times and taken a back seat when voters are more concerned about their economic livelihood. According toGallup polling,external, 40% of Americans worried a ""great deal"" about climate change in 2000, dropping to 26% in 2004 after the 9/11 attacks and the dot com recession. Concern peaked again at 41% in 2007, before collapsing to 25% in the wake of the Great Recession. Now the issue is on the rise again, reaching a record high of 45% in March, up 8 points from the same time last year. Some of this can be attributed to the anti-Trump phenomenon, where the president's position drives near universal opposition from those who hold him in low esteem. The dynamic played itself out earlier this year on healthcare, where the Obamacare reforms reached net-positive levels of approval for the first time shortly after Republicans began efforts to pass repeal legislation. Paris City Hall turned green in an act of defiance The question now is whether global warming and environmental issues will have political legs. Activists will certainly be motivated to unseat Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans - including some of the Bernie-or-bust voters and Green Party supporters who turned their backs on Democrats last autumn. Because of the way the Paris agreement withdrawal is structured, the process won't be complete until just weeks after the 2020 presidential election, virtually guaranteeing the issue will come up in the campaign in some fashion. Five effects of US pullout Reaction to Trump Paris deal decision What is the Paris climate agreement? Whether it hurts Mr Trump and his party will have little to do with the amount of scorn he receives from the international community or degraded US influence on the world stage, and considerably more to do with the state of the US economy over the next few years. Are coal-country jobs coming back? Given the underlying economic fundamentals of the US energy sector, that seems unlikely, despite the president's boast of a new mine opening up soon in Pennsylvania (resulting in only about70 new jobs,external). This video can not be played Can coal make a comeback under Trump? During his White House speech, Mr Trump predicted that the US economy would grow in the range of 3% to 4% in the coming years - an ambitious mark that, if realised, would put him well on the way to re-election. Come in under that mark, however, and the president will have to campaign on jobs not lost and economic growth not thwarted. If working-class Americans continue to struggle, that will be as hard a sell for him as it was for Democrats when they held power the last eight years. Trump supporters largely support pulling out of Paris Then there's history's judgement to consider. Decades from now, Americans could look back and see 1 June 2017 as a missed opportunity, when the US had a chance to address an impending environmental disaster and shrugged. If that's the case, there will be one party - and one president - to blame. Or, if Republicans are right and the dire climate warnings are overblown, the date will be nothing more than a historical footnote. In the near term and long, Mr Trump and Republicans are playing political roulette, betting against the rest of the world and half of their own nation. The price for being in the wrong spot when the wheel stops spinning will be high.

"Leo Varadkar, who is stepping down at the age of 45, has served two terms as taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who isstepping down as Fine Gael leader and Irish prime minister, made history for lots of reasons when he became taoiseach. The son of an Irish nurse and a Indian-born doctor, he was Ireland's youngest andfirst gay leader. Now 45, he was just 38 years old when he was first taoiseach in 2017. At the time, he was widely seen as embodying the liberalisation of a country once regarded as one of the most socially conservative in Europe. He served twice as taoiseach in coalition governments - first from June 2017 to June 2020 and then again from December 2022. In 2015, he came out as gay in an interview with the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ His first term was dominated by Ireland's bullish response to Brexit and insistence that no ""hard border"" could be re-imposed between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. As the Covid-19 pandemic began to rapidly spread to Europe, Mr Varadkar's Fine Gael party lost seats in the general election in February 2020. It took several months to form a new coalition government - with Fine Gael teaming up with its old Civil War rivals in the Fianna FÃ¡il party to share power in an unusual ""revolving taoiseach"" deal. The 2020 deal meant Mr Varadkar served half a government term as tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), under Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin as taoiseach. Then halfway through the government, the pair swapped roles and Mr Varadkar began his second term as taoiseach in December 2022. US President Joe Biden accepted a bowl of shamrock from Leo Varadkar on Sunday The future Irish leader was born on 18 January 1979 in Dublin. His father Ashok - a doctor from Mumbai - met his mother Miriam, an Irish nurse, while they were both working in Slough in Berkshire. The couple settled in Ireland in the 1970s. The country Mr Varadkar grew up in was very different to today. Until the 1990s, homosexuality and divorce were illegal. There were few immigrants, and the Republic of Ireland was one of the poorer members of the EU. Mr Varadkar followed his father into medicine, qualifying as a GP in 2010. He became a councillor aged 24 and, in 2007, he was elected to the Irish parliament, DÃ¡il Ãireann. Leo Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett welcomed Prince William and his wife Catherine to Dublin's Government Buildings in 2020 He rose to power after a turbulent decade of boom to bust. Ireland's Celtic Tiger economy crashed spectacularly in 2007 amid the worldwide financial crisis, and the previous government had to accept a Â£71bn international bailout. In the aftermath, Fine Gael came to power at the head of a coalition in 2011 and Mr Varadkar got his first ministerial appointment as transport, tourism and sport. By 2014, the doctor had become Ireland's health minister. He built up a high media profile - descriptions of him as a ""sharp-shooter"" and ""straight-talker"" were common. In 2015, he came out as gay in an interview with the Irish national broadcaster, RTÃ. ""It's not a big deal for me any more. I hope it's not a big deal for anyone else - it shouldn't be,"" he said. Leo Varadkar attended the 2017 Dublin Pride parade shortly after taking office A few months later, Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage. In 2017, the then taoiseach Enda Kenny announced his retirement and Mr Varadkar won a leadership contest to replace him. At the age of 38, he became Ireland's youngest prime minister. Days after taking office, he attended Dublin's Pride Parade and promised to use his position to campaign for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Leo Varadkar said he would use his office to promote gay rights around the world Within his first year of taking office, theIrish electorate voted overwhelmingly to overturn the state's ban on abortion, repealing the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution by 66.4% to 33.6%. His second term as taoiseach has been beset by problems including a cost of living crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The Irish government has struggled to house thousands of Ukrainian refugees at a time when the country is experiencing a homelessness crisis. Leo Varadkar meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2023 In November 2023, much ofDublin city centre was engulfed by serious riotingwhich was sparked by the stabbing of children outside a school. It took the country's police force by surprise, and the government's response to the riot was widely criticised. Earlier this month, Mr Varadkar's government suffered an embarrassing defeat when voters overwhelmingly rejected its bid to change the constitution through two referendums. Proposals to alter wording in the constitution to include families which are not based on marriage were defeated with 67.7% voting no. A second proposed change on the wording around the role of women in the home was defeated by a higher margin with 73.9% of voters rejecting it. It was the highest ever no vote percentage in an Irish referendum.

"Tea time at the ""international friendship"" house North Korea frightens the world with its missile tests and threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes. This is precisely why a British student thinks it's time to try making friends with North Koreans - the people who live there - or at least to get to know them better, writes the BBC's Eleanor Dunn. ""We're so quick to label North Korea as 'forbidden', 'closed', 'crazy', 'suffering' - but I want to take away that barrier we've created, just for a minute, and shed light on North Korea at a human level,"" says 24-year-old Benjamin Griffin. Before his first visit four years ago his knowledge of the country had been limited to ""one documentary and some YouTube clips"". So the package holiday with Juche Travel Services (JTS), an officially approved tourism agency, was an eye-opener. ""When I first saw Pyongyang in 2013, I was expecting an army of soldiers everywhere I went. It was as if I hadn't seen them as real people,"" he says. In fact he saw people walking to work, shopping, eating, dancing in the park. Somehow normal life seemed surprising. ""The truth is, in the everyday life of a Pyongyang citizen, they're not worried about how best to defeat US imperialism or how evil capitalism is. They care about, 'Where am I going to go shopping today? Where am I in my job? Is my daughter going to get married?'"" The following year, as a 21-year-old, he went back to volunteer as an English teacher at Pyongyang's tourism college. Griffin with students at the tourism college Later he became a qualified JTS tour guide himself and has now created a no-frills ""study tour"" for people of any age or nationality to spend three weeks at Kim Il-sung university in July. Participants will sleep in university dormitories and study Korean language for four hours per day. The rest of the time they will go on guided sightseeing tours, and take part in activities such as swimming, folk dancing and five-a-side football, when there will be a chance to meet North Koreans - albeit North Koreans carefully screened and chosen for this role. ""We should absolutely not forgive the glaring problems of North Korea, but we need some base level of mutual understanding. Educational tourism is a step towards that. ""I don't want to stop being critical but it's also vital to find what the country's core is, and what people value there. ""Of course the politics exists - they have nuclear tests, unthinkable human rights abuses - but it's important to focus on human-to-human interactions. There's so much to be said for that exchange of information, however it happens."" Supreme leader Kim Jong-un studied physics at Kim Il-sung university Griffin doesn't deny the realities of North Korean life - the crippling poverty of the famished countryside and the cult of personality surrounding the supreme leader and his family. In Pyongyang, a city reserved for families of the elite, people usually work six days a week for 10 to 12 hours a day - with Sunday dedicated to ""rest and voluntary work"", such as grass-cutting and rehearsals for mass dances. ""There isn't a lot of time alone,"" Griffin says. But despite the relentless propaganda attacking Western imperialism, some North Koreans take an interest in Western culture, Griffin says. Clothing brands such as Nike and Adidas, both genuine and counterfeit, are finding their way into the country, and the students from privileged families Griffin taught in 2014 were knowledgeable about Western singers and films. ""I remember them asking me for gossip about Beyonce - about a dress she had worn to an award ceremony - I have no idea where they got that information. They had even watched some American and British films I hadn't seen!"" he says. The class was not accustomed to seeing monsters on screen, however, and some hid under their desks when he played them a clip from the film, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Maintaining discipline was not a problem Griffin faced. ""At first they were so regimented - when I walked into the room they would immediately stop chatting and stand up. I would say, 'Guys, you don't need to do that.' And they would all say, 'Good morning, Professor Ben.' ""But that started to change after I bumped into a few of them around Pyongyang. They would tell me about their boyfriend dramas, or where they had lunch. They loved to get me to say English tongue-twisters, and would record me on their phones."" Why North Korea is a safe haven for birds Fighting for survival on the streets of North Korea Detained and interrogated for 10 hours Karaoke is popular among Griffin's fellow tour guides. Sometimes they go out for an evening of singing in Pyongyang, but Griffin also recalls a long minibus journey when the guides he was travelling with declared it was karaoke time. ""They were two young women, and one of them had a genuinely beautiful, angelic voice. Then the other one stood up - and she had obviously watched Titanic recently. For about 10 minutes we were stuck in this minibus listening to the screechiest, most out-of-tune version of My Heart Will Go On you could ever imagine. She obviously wanted to embrace the opportunity to perform in front of foreigners. ""It was so hard not to laugh. In moments like that you're really suspended out of the politics for a minute. It's just a person - not a scary North Korean."" Folk dancing outdoors in Pyongyang Griffin rejects the idea that someone who pays for a visit to North Korea is effectively subsidising its nuclear programme, or propping up the regime. If the study tour he has helped to organise covers its costs, he says, any money left over will go to the host university, which will spend it on such things as teachers or maintenance. And anyway, he argues, the need for dialogue and cultural exchange is of overriding importance. To drive home his point he produces a viral satellite image of North Korea at night - a chillingly black hole sandwiched between the glaring city lights of Shenyang and Seoul. The lights of Shenyang (top left) and Seoul (middle) with the darkness of North Korea in between ""This is a great example of how we understand North Korea. It's us and them, dark and light, good and evil. It's dark, it's unknown. We're given all these reductive cliches - a lens through which to look at the DPRK. It's too simplistic - if the country is only 'evil', can it ever do anything good? ""If this photo had been taken in the day, we couldn't even see any visible division between the countries. North Korea does belong to our world."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"Standing in the Rose Garden on Thursday at the White House, President Donald Trump outlined his reasons for withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. More than 190 countries have committed to the deal that aims to reduce globalgreenhouse gas emissions. Mr Trump noted the potentially ""tens of billions of dollars"" that the US was required to spend on the Green Climate Fund - set up to raise money from the wealthiest nations to be spent on environmental projects in developing countries. Established in 2011, 43 countries have now pledged to the fund, raising $10bn (Â£7.8bn) to date. Mr Trump complained that other countries had not paid and that the agreement was against America's interests. The US has spent more than any other country. However, there is no obligation for countries to pay into the fund, as it is voluntary. So far, money from the fund has gone on projects across the world including water conservation in Morocco and helping farmers tackle extreme weather in Sri Lanka. As Mr Trump noted, the United States has pledged $3bn (Â£2.3bn) and actually spent $1bn (Â£776m) so far. President Obama submitted the second half of that amount onlythree days before Mr Trump's inauguration.,externalIt came from the State Department's Economic Support Fund (ESF), which finances a range of development, security, counter-terrorism and humanitarian projects to advance political and strategic interests in countries such as Iraq, South Sudan, Colombia and Afghanistan. Mr Trump said funding was ""raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism"". Although money from the ESF could be used in counter-terrorism, it is not the main source of funding for America's war against terrorism - that is the defence budget. As Mr Trump noted in his speech, one goal of the Paris Agreement was to raise $100bn (Â£77.7bn) a year by 2020 to support climate action in developing countries, first discussed as a target in 2010. The money would be used to help poorer countries invest in green energy and renewable technology. The Green Climate Fund is one mechanism set up to raise money to reach that annual target. US - $3bn (Â£2.3bn) Japan - $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) UK - $1.2bn (Â£931m) France - $1bn (Â£776m) Germany - $1bn (Â£776m) Source:Green Climate Fund,external The UK has paid about Â£400m into the fund so far, and Japan nearly half of its pledged amount. However, this does not necessarily paint the same picture if you take the population size of the countries into account. According to the Green Climate Fund's tracker, the US pledge amounts to just over $9 (Â£7) a person. Sweden's pledge represents almost $60 (Â£47) per person, the highest out of any country. The UK has proposed almost Â£15 a person. India and China have not put forward any cash into the Green Climate Fund. China has madeavailable significant funds,externalfor a different fund to help developing countries combat climate change.

"Michiyo Nishigaki lost her only son Naoya to ""karoshi"" Japan has some of the longest working hours in the world, and some young Japanese workers are literally working themselves to death. Now there are calls for the government to do more. Michiyo Nishigaki was a proud mother when her only son Naoya landed a job at a large Japanese telecoms company, straight out of college. He loved computers, and it seemed like a great opportunity in Japan's competitive graduate jobs market. But just two years later things started to go wrong. ""He was telling me he'd been busy, but he said he was OK,"" Ms Nishigaki tells me. ""But then he came home for my father's funeral and he couldn't get out of bed. He said: 'Let me sleep a while, I can't get up. Sorry, Mum, but let me sleep'."" Japan has some of the longest working hours in the developed world Later she learned from colleagues that he'd been working around the clock. ""He usually worked until the last train, but if he missed it he slept at his desk,"" she said. ""In the worst case he had to work overnight through to 10pm the next evening, working 37 hours in total."" Two years later Naoya died at the age of 27 from an overdose of medication. His death was officially rule a case of ""karoshi"" - the Japanese term to describe death attributed to overwork. Listen to Edwin Lane's report on Business Daily, BBC World Service Japan has a culture of long working hours and this is not a new phenomenon - it was first recorded in the 1960s - but recently high-profile cases have thrust karoshi back into the spotlight. On Christmas Day in 2015, 24-year-old Matsuri Takahashi, an employee at the Japanese advertising agency Dentsu, jumped to her death. It emerged she had barely slept after working more than 100 hours of overtime a month in the period leading up to her death. Dentsu's president Tadashi Ishii (centre) resigned, a year after Ms Takahashi's death Makoto Iwahashi says that is not unusual, particularly for new starters in a company. He works for Posse, an organisation that runs a helpline for young workers, and says most of the calls are complaints about long working hours. ""It's sad because young workers think they don't have any other choice,"" he tells me. ""If you don't quit you have to work 100 hours. If you quit you just can't live."" Mr Iwahashi says declining job security has made the situation worse. ""We had karoshi in the 1960s and 70s - the big difference is they had to work long hours but they were secured lifetime employment. That's not the case any more."" Official figures put cases of karoshi in the hundreds each year, counting heart attacks, strokes and suicides. But campaigners say the real figure is much higher. Nearly a quarter of Japanese companies have employees working more than 80 hours overtime a month, often unpaid, a recent survey found. And 12% have employees breaking the 100 hours a month mark. Those numbers are important; 80 hours overtime a month is regarded as the threshold above which you have an increased chance of dying. Nearly a quarter of Japanese companies have employees working more than 80 hours overtime a month Japan's government has been under increasing pressure to act, but the challenge has been to break a decades-old work culture where it's frowned upon to leave before your colleagues or boss. Earlier this year the government introduced Premium Fridays, encouraging firms to let their employees out early, at 3pm, on the last Friday each month. They also want Japanese workers to take more holiday. Workers are entitled to 20 days leave a year but currently about 35% don't take any of it. In the local government offices in Toshima, a district of downtown Tokyo, they have resorted to turning the office lights off at 7pm in an effort to force people to go home. Hitoshi Ueno says it's important for employees to develop their own interests outside of the office ""We wanted to do something visible,"" says manager Hitoshi Ueno. ""It's not just about cutting working hours. We want people to be more efficient and productive, so that everyone can protect and enjoy their spare time. We want to change the work environment in total."" In focusing on efficiency he may have a point. While the country may have some of the longest working hours it is the least productive of the G7 group of developed economies. But campaigners say these measures are piecemeal and fail to address the core problem: that young workers are dying because they are working too hard and for too long. The only solution they say is to put a legal limit on the overtime employees are permitted to work. Japan may have some of the longest working hours it is the least productive of the G7 group of developed economies Earlier this year the government proposed limiting average overtime to 60 hours a month though firms would be allowed to up this to 100 hours during ""busy periods"" - well into the karoshi red zone. Critics say the government is prioritising business and economic interests at the expense of the welfare of workers. ""The Japanese people count on the government but they are being betrayed,"" says Koji Morioka, an academic who has studied the karoshi phenomenon for 30 years. In the meantime, more young workers are dying and the support groups for bereaved families keep getting new members. Michiyo Nishigaki, who lost her son Naoya, says the country is killing the very workers it should be cherishing. ""Companies just focus on short-term profits,"" she says. ""My son and other young workers don't hate work. they are capable and they want to do well. ""Give them the opportunity to work without long hours or health problems and the country would be privileged to have them.""

"The case of Dina Ali sparked a debate Saudi Arabia's guardianship law, which requires women to get permission from a male relative for everyday activities A trip taken by a young Saudi woman - and her unwilling journey back to her home country - opened up a debate about Saudi laws which require females to get permission from male relatives before they travel or undertake a host of everyday tasks. Frightened and in an unfamiliar country, Dina Ali Lasloom approached a stranger in Manila airport. Lasloom, a 24-year-old Saudi woman, was attempting to leave her family in Kuwait and intended to seek asylum in Australia. But after being stopped in transit in the Philippines, she faced being sent back to Saudi Arabia. The stranger she approached in the airport was Meagan Khan, a Canadian woman. In just a few hours, the two formed a close bond. Khan says that Lasloom told her that she learned that her uncles were on their way to find her in Manila. Lasloom recorded a plea for help on Khan's phone. ""Dina was sitting across from me eating a sandwich and I was looking at her and I saw a change in her face. ""She just completely lost every single emotion and a completely terrified look appeared in her face. She said 'Meagan they're here.' ""I said 'What?' ""She said 'Meagan! Meagan, send the video, they're here.' And I turned and saw two men and a woman walking towards us and I said to her 'Are those your uncles?' ""And she said: 'Yes.'"" She was put on a flight to Riyadh, but not before hervideo,externalappeal went viral on Twitter. The hashtag ""Save Dina Ali"" began trending on 11 April, before she had even arrived back in Saudi Arabia. That was the last that Khan and women's rights activists heard from her.BBC Trendinghas now pieced together the timeline behind the mysterious story of Dina Ali Lasloom, the debate about Saudi Arabia's guardianship law and what has happened to her after she was made to return. According to a number of people who have spoken to Trending, Lasloom was attempting to escape an arranged marriage. In the video, she claimed the authorities in Manila prevented her from boarding a connecting flight, and took her passport. A picture of Dina Ali Lasloom's boarding pass was posted on Twitter On Twitter activists, who saw Lasloom's video were trying their best to draw attention to her predicament. One was the prominent Saudi feminist Moudi Aljohani, who fled her home country eight months ago, and is now seeking asylum in the US. Guardianship derives from a particular interpretation of Islamic law - and in Saudi Arabia, women are required to get the permission of a male relative if they want to do a number of things, including get a passport, travel abroad or marry. Saudi activist Moudi Aljohani was one of a number of people who used social media to draw attention to Dina's case ""I was very stressed, I was trying my best to use Twitter to seek help for Dina,"" Aljohani says. ""I was trying my best to contact the NGOs and the media, which unfortunately didn't cover the story until it was too late."" On 12 April, the Saudi embassy in the Philippines released a statement saying that Lasloom's return was a ""family matter."" Trending tried to contact Lasloom's uncles, but got no response. Activists say that upon arriving in Saudi Arabia, Lasloom was first taken to a women's detention centre in Riyadh. According to Washington-based Saudi women's rights scholar Hala Aldosari, the detention centres are similar to prisons. ""Women don't go out but they do have access to education. And we know of women who have committed suicide in those confined imprisonments,"" Aldosari says. Due to the secrecy surrounding these detention centres, BBC Trending was unable to independently verify Aldosari's statements. What we do know, according to both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, is that at present Lasloom is believed to have been moved from a detention centre to a shelter - a place, according to activists, with better conditions where women are moved to if they can prove that they are in danger at home. You can hear more on this story onBBC Trending on the BBC World Service And for more Trending stories,download our podcast The online campaign to save Lasloom died down shortly after her case hit the headlines, yet it didn't close down completely, and the issue is a perennial one in Saudi society. Weeks after her ordeal went viral, a pair of sistersattempted,externalto flee Saudi Arabia via Turkey, claiming that they were abused by their family. Their case prompted some people online to draw parallels with Lasloom and, once again, question Saudi's guardianship law. Human Rights Watch (HRW) encouraged people to tweet the ""Save Dina Ali"" hashtag to Saudi's King Salman. The group continues tocampaign,externalfor the end of guardianship. ""Dina Ali is by no means the only Saudi woman who found herself in this tragic situation,"" says HRW's Ahmed Benchemsi. ""In early April of this year Maryam Al Otaibi, another Saudi woman... fled abusive family members ""In Saudi Arabia women like Dina Ali and Maryam Al Otaibi who flee their family can also face so-called honour violence or serious harm if they return against their will."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external And the chatter around Saudi's guardianship rules seems to be prompting some changes in the country. According to astatement,externalpublished on the Saudi Human Rights Commission earlier this month, the king issued a directive loosening guardianship rules. The measures would allow women greater access to education and medicine without the approval of a male relative. Women would still need permission, however, to travel and get married. Earlier this month King Salman issued a directive loosening guardianship rules Some believe that the guardianship system should not be abolished completely. ""The guardianship law comes from the bond of two parties (i.e. father and daughter),"" says Saudi journalist Bander Otayf. ""The guardianship law was not legislated to oppress women, but to protect them, and the few cases where guardians abuse women don't represent the system."" Yet for activists like Moudi Aljohani, the changes are nowhere near enough, and the Dina Ali case highlights the ongoing restrictions faced by women in the kingdom. ""Dina Ali wasn't allowed to feel what I felt when I set a foot at JFK airport (in New York),"" she says. ""I was in shock that I finally had my freedom. Dina will never know what I felt after I made it."" Since she was taken to Riyadh, none of the activists BBC Trending spoke to have heard from Dina Ali Lasloom.  But most agree that her case is unlikely to be the last to trigger a debate about guardianship.

"Pilates devotee Cassey Ho has nearly four million YouTube followers In the 1980s, a Lycra-clad Jane Fonda sold millions of her pioneering workout video cassettes. But videotape gave way to DVDs, then along came the internet and digital streaming. So how has the workout video adapted? When Cassey Ho, 30, logs on to her YouTube page ""blogilates"" and uploads her latest workout video, she knows she will soon be inundated with comments from fans across all her social media accounts. The fitness video blogger, or vlogger for short, has amassed nearly four million subscribers to her YouTube channel, as well as millions of followers on Facebook and Instagram. She is one of a new breed of fitness vloggers exploiting the internet's ability to beam content to global mass audiences at very low production costs. It's a far cry from when fitness queen Jane Fonda inspired millions of people around the world to try aerobics in front of their living room TVs throughout the 1980s. She sold more than 17 million tapes. Jane Fonda (right) was the fitness video queen in the 1980s Scores of other models, actors and stars followed suit. But today, you can find more than 30 million fitness videos on YouTube alone, and countless more on other social media platforms. Budding fitness kings and queens can publish and gain a following without star status, a fancy studio or thousands of pounds' worth of equipment, simply recording workouts on their smartphones at the beach or in their gardens and editing the content on their laptops. But unlike the traditional workout video, where weight loss and fitness was the goal, consumers are logging on to their favourite fitness vloggers for a more intimate and interactive experience. ""Fitness videos have switched from being functional to being aspirational content that give people a window into the lives of the fitness influencers they look up to,"" says Richard Wilson, chief executive of Clickon Media, a content creation firm. For example, Zuzka Light, a 35-year-old Czech fitness vlogger now based in Los Angeles, started her channel in 2012. Her vlog shows short workout videos, with some of them attracting up to 20 million views. Fitness vlogger Zuzka Light thinks the ""personal approach is really key"" Taking her brand on to other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, has raised her profile, giving her the opportunity to launch a $9.99 a month subscription to her website and her own clothing and food supplement lines. ""I always try to post videos that I would like to watch myself,"" she tells the BBC. ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've had feedback from my viewers who say they feel connected to me and see me as their friend, their workout buddy. ""I think the personal approach is really key."" She regularly works with brands, but admits she's picky about the products she introduces to her audiences. ""Being an influencer I have a responsibility and I wouldn't want to take advantage of that and promote something I wouldn't use myself or something I wouldn't recommend to my loved ones."" Has the time now come for internet voting? How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think How Cuba's growing internet is fuelling new businesses Click here for more Technology of Business features,external A study by marketing platform MuseFind found that 92% of people preferred hearing about brands from influencers, rather than through paid adverts. ""This switch in perspective provides marketers and advertisers the freedom to develop more authentic content that tells a story as opposed to being purely functional and demonstrating things such as weight loss and technique,"" says Mr Wilson. The fitness sector in general is huge, with the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association reporting that global health club industry revenue reached an estimated $81bn (Â£63bn) in 2015, with around 151 million members worldwide. And the fitness clothing industry is worth more than $320bn in the US alone, says the NPD Group. No wonder vloggers are proving very useful for brands trying to reach consumers directly and bypass the growing use of ad blockers on mobiles and desktops. Cassey Ho has also developed a group fitness business called POP Pilates ""The growth of smartphone usage and mobile video viewing lends itself well to a fitness audience,"" says Mark Brill, lecturer in digital communications at Birmingham City University. ""Not only can content be viewed anywhere, but mobile devices also make the interaction personal and more private. ""In the past, word of mouth has been an important way to recommend brands. That has shifted into the digital word of mouth - social media."" And it's not just fitness vloggers benefiting from taking their workouts online. Fitness studios are realising the potential of live streaming videos of classes and videos featuring their clients'  favourite instructors. Some fitness studios, such as Barre3, are putting classes online to widen their appeal Barre3, the ballet-based workout in New York, has a subscription-based fitness video service via its website to allow members to exercise from the comfort of their own homes. Standalone services, such as Flex TV, which provide online access to live high-intensity interval training workouts and yoga classes, are popping up too. So the traditional workout video on tape or DVD has adapted to a world in which people are more used to streaming entertainment over services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube. Declining DVD sales bear this out. ""Fewer people are buying DVDs and it reduces the revenue opportunities for a workout video,"" says Mr Brill. ""The new revenue comes from advertising share, especially on YouTube, and from sponsorship for those with a large enough social media following. ""Looking at it that way, it seems almost inevitable that the fitness vloggers will triumph.""

"Melting glacier in Austria For a speech about whether the US should remain a party to the Paris climate accord, Donald Trump's Rose Garden address on Thursday didn't have a whole lot of discussion about, you know, the climate. There was plenty of talk about jobs and the US economy. He offered more than a few expressions of concern over whether other nations were being given an unfair advantage over the US. And then there was that lengthy opening plug for his presidential accomplishments that had nothing to do with the environment whatsoever. At one point the president made a somewhat oblique reference to current climate science, asserting that even if all nations hit their self-set, non-mandatory greenhouse gas emissions targets under the Paris agreement, it would only result in a reduction of 0.2 degrees in average global temperatures by the year 2100. (The researchers who conducted the studysaid,externalthe number he cited was outdated and misrepresented.) Mr Trump's relative silence on the matter has left reporters wondering whether the president still stands by earlier comments - and tweets - expressing serious scepticism about whether climate change is real. Does he still believe it's a Chinese plot to make the US less competitive, ashe tweeted,externalin November 2012? Or that it is a money-making ""hoax"", ashe said,externalduring a December 2015 campaign rally?"" This video can not be played President Trump says the Paris climate accord ""disadvantages"" US He's occasionally backed away from such sweeping denunciations. During the first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, he denied having ever blamed the Chinese. In a New York Timesinterview,externalshortly after his election victory, he said he thinks there's ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change. After Mr Trump announced his Paris agreement withdrawal, reporters posed the almost-too-obvious question once again to White House aides tasked with selling the move to the public. Does the president believe human activity contributes to climate change? Will US cities go it alone? Will this hurt Trump? They asked about it during an on-background session with two administration officials on Thursday afternoon. They asked White House advisor Kellyanne Conway during a television appearance Friday morning. They asked Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt during his press conference on Friday afternoon. Time and time again the answer was some variation of ""I don't know"", ""I can't say"" or ""that's not relevant"". ""We focused on one key issue,"" Mr Pruitt said during one of the multiple times he was pressed on his boss's views. ""Was Paris good or bad for the country?"" On Tuesday Press Secretary Sean Spicer had said he didn't know the president's thoughts about climate change because he hadn't asked him. On Friday he was asked whether he had since had a chance to speak to the president. One question dominated the briefing ""I have not had the opportunity to do that,"" Spicer replied. The rest of the press conference was an extended parlour game to try to get the press secretary to slip and perhaps inadvertently shed some light on Mr Trump's views - to no avail. It's clear at this point that the administration has no interest in clarifying Mr Trump's position on climate change. But why? This video can not be played Students from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, are divided on Trump Paris pullout Confusion can often be a politician's ally. The embattled president needs his core supporters to stick with him through what could be a rough road ahead. Those who don't believe climate change is real can look at the president's past comments as proof their man still stands with them without anyone having to explicitly say so. What is climate change? What is in the Paris climate deal? That allows the president to insist that he is willing to do something to address climate change - ""renegotiating"" the Paris accord, perhaps - without saying climate change is a problem. It allows him tell themajority of Americans,externalwho believe climate change is a real global threat that he is trying to address their concerns. It allows administration surrogates like Mr Pruitt to tout that the US has lowered its carbon output without acknowledging the only reason this would be a noteworthy accomplishment - human activity affects the global climate. It's a fine line to walk for even the most dextrous of White House communications teams - let alone one that has to be concerned that the next time the president is asked the question, there's no telling what he might say.

"Beef kebabs are popular with millions of Indians A lawmaker from India's southern state of Kerala has announced that he is returning to eating meat, fish and eggs after practising vegetarianism for nearly two decades. There's nothing unusual about a lapsed vegetarian but VT Balram said his decision was prompted by the federal Hindu nationalist BJP government's attempt to seize the people's right to eat what they wanted. ""I have been living without eating meat, fish or eggs since 1998. But now the time has come break it and uphold the right politics of food assertively,"" Mr Balram said, while posting avideo,externalof him eating beef with friends and fellow party workers. The BJP believes that cows should be protected, because they are considered holy by India's majority Hindu population. Some 18 Indian states have already banned slaughter of cattle. But millions of Indians, including Dalits (formerly untouchables), Muslims and Christians, consume beef.  And it's another matter, say many, that there's no outrage against the routine selling of male calves by Hindu farmers and pastoralists to middlemen for slaughter as the animals are of little use - bullocks have been phased out by tractors in much of rural India, and villagers need to rear only the occasional bull. Why the humble cow is India's most polarising animal Human cost of India's meat 'ban' Ironically, the cow has become a polarising animal. Two years ago, a mob attacked a man andkilled him over ""rumours"" that his family ate beef. Vigilante cow protection groups, operating with impunity, havekilled peoplefor transporting cattle. More recently, the chief of BJP's powerful ideological fountainheadRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(National Volunteers' Organisation) has called for acountrywide ban on the slaughter of cows.,externalAnd this week, a senior judge said thecow should be declared a national animal,externaland people who slaughter cows should be sentenced to life in prison. Many say this is all contributing to effectively killing India's thriving buffalo meat trade. Several states opposed the federal government's decision to ban the sale of cattle for slaughter Earlier this week, several Indian statesopposed the federal government's decision to ban the sale of cattle for slaughterat livestock markets. The government said the order was aimed at preventing uncontrolled and unregulated animal trade. But the ban, say many, could end up hurting some $4bn (Â£3.11bn) in annual beef exports and millions of jobs. There are some 190 million cattle in India, and tens of millions ""go out of the system,external"" - die or need to be slaughtered - every year. How will poor farmers sell their animals? So, as lawyer Gautam Bhatia says, the new rules are ""perceived as imposing an indirect beef ban,external"". He believes the government will find it difficult to defend them if they are challenged in the court - one state court, responding to a petition that they violate the right of a person to chose what he eats, has alreadyput the ban on hold,external. The badly-drafted rules, Mr Bhatia says, are ""an opportunity for citizens and courts to think once again whether the prescription of food choices is consistent with a Constitution that promises economic and social liberty to all"". Critics have been calling the beef ban an example of ""dietary profiling"" and ""food fascism"". Others say it smacks of cultural imperialism, and is a brazen attack on India's secularism and constitutional values. Don't laugh, but there could be a conspiracy to turn India vegetarian, screamed a recentheadline,external. Why beef ban in Indian state undermines secularism The Indian state that is obsessed with beef fry Many believe that the BJP, under Narendra Modi, appears to be completely out of depth with India's widely diverse food practices which have always been distinguished by religion, region, caste, class, age and gender. Indians now eat more meat, including beef - cow and buffalo meat - than ever. Consumption of beef grew up 14% in cities, and 35% in villages, according togovernment data analysed by IndiaSpend,external, a non-profit data journalism initiative. Beef is the preferred meat in north-eastern states like Nagaland and Meghalaya. According to National Sample Survey data, 42% Indians describe themselves as vegetarians who don't eat eggs, fish or meat; anotherbaseline government survey,externalshowed 71% of Indians over the age of 15 are non-vegetarian. Critics say the ban is an attack on rights of citizens Governments have tried to impose food bans and choices around the world, mostly using health and environment concerns and hygiene concerns. In the US, for example, groups have rallied against subsidised vegetables, outlawing large sodas, promotion of organic food and taxing fat. Bangkok isbanning street foodto clean up streets and enforce hygiene standards. India has done the same in the past. Crops likeBT brinjal,externalhave been stalled by the government and industrially manufactured food like Maggi noodlesbanned temporarilyamid claims they contained dangerously high levels of lead. Scarcity has also led to bans - a ban of milk sweets in the 1970s in Delhi was justified because milk used to be in short supply. ""To the extent that this ban on cattle slaughter justifies itself by speaking of 'unfit and infected cattle', it seems to invoke public health, but then stops short by not banning the sale of goats, sheep and chicken as well,"" sociologist Amita Baviskar told me. ""In fact, the public health argument leads logically to a move towards better regulation like stricter checking of animals for disease, more hygienic slaughter and storage of meat rather than a flat-out ban."" Clearly, the ban appears to be working already. There are fears that the proposed ban would hit a thriving buffalo meat exports ""Selling red meat, even goat meat, in a BJP-ruled state is now injurious to one's health. Who would want to risk the wrath of the vigilantes?,"" says Dr Baviskar. As it is, she says, meat-eating habits of Indians have been changing rapidly in the last couple of decades and the chicken, once regarded as a ""dirty bird"", is now the most popular meat. ""I see a greater polarisation taking place between red states (meat-eating) and white states (chicken eating)  Within the white states, meat-eaters will have to skulk about, looking over their shoulder as they bite into a beef kebab"".

"Leo Varadkar, who is stepping down at the age of 45, has served two terms as taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who isstepping down as Fine Gael leader and Irish prime minister, made history for lots of reasons when he became taoiseach. The son of an Irish nurse and a Indian-born doctor, he was Ireland's youngest andfirst gay leader. Now 45, he was just 38 years old when he was first taoiseach in 2017. At the time, he was widely seen as embodying the liberalisation of a country once regarded as one of the most socially conservative in Europe. He served twice as taoiseach in coalition governments - first from June 2017 to June 2020 and then again from December 2022. In 2015, he came out as gay in an interview with the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ His first term was dominated by Ireland's bullish response to Brexit and insistence that no ""hard border"" could be re-imposed between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. As the Covid-19 pandemic began to rapidly spread to Europe, Mr Varadkar's Fine Gael party lost seats in the general election in February 2020. It took several months to form a new coalition government - with Fine Gael teaming up with its old Civil War rivals in the Fianna FÃ¡il party to share power in an unusual ""revolving taoiseach"" deal. The 2020 deal meant Mr Varadkar served half a government term as tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), under Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin as taoiseach. Then halfway through the government, the pair swapped roles and Mr Varadkar began his second term as taoiseach in December 2022. US President Joe Biden accepted a bowl of shamrock from Leo Varadkar on Sunday The future Irish leader was born on 18 January 1979 in Dublin. His father Ashok - a doctor from Mumbai - met his mother Miriam, an Irish nurse, while they were both working in Slough in Berkshire. The couple settled in Ireland in the 1970s. The country Mr Varadkar grew up in was very different to today. Until the 1990s, homosexuality and divorce were illegal. There were few immigrants, and the Republic of Ireland was one of the poorer members of the EU. Mr Varadkar followed his father into medicine, qualifying as a GP in 2010. He became a councillor aged 24 and, in 2007, he was elected to the Irish parliament, DÃ¡il Ãireann. Leo Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett welcomed Prince William and his wife Catherine to Dublin's Government Buildings in 2020 He rose to power after a turbulent decade of boom to bust. Ireland's Celtic Tiger economy crashed spectacularly in 2007 amid the worldwide financial crisis, and the previous government had to accept a Â£71bn international bailout. In the aftermath, Fine Gael came to power at the head of a coalition in 2011 and Mr Varadkar got his first ministerial appointment as transport, tourism and sport. By 2014, the doctor had become Ireland's health minister. He built up a high media profile - descriptions of him as a ""sharp-shooter"" and ""straight-talker"" were common. In 2015, he came out as gay in an interview with the Irish national broadcaster, RTÃ. ""It's not a big deal for me any more. I hope it's not a big deal for anyone else - it shouldn't be,"" he said. Leo Varadkar attended the 2017 Dublin Pride parade shortly after taking office A few months later, Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage. In 2017, the then taoiseach Enda Kenny announced his retirement and Mr Varadkar won a leadership contest to replace him. At the age of 38, he became Ireland's youngest prime minister. Days after taking office, he attended Dublin's Pride Parade and promised to use his position to campaign for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Leo Varadkar said he would use his office to promote gay rights around the world Within his first year of taking office, theIrish electorate voted overwhelmingly to overturn the state's ban on abortion, repealing the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution by 66.4% to 33.6%. His second term as taoiseach has been beset by problems including a cost of living crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The Irish government has struggled to house thousands of Ukrainian refugees at a time when the country is experiencing a homelessness crisis. Leo Varadkar meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2023 In November 2023, much ofDublin city centre was engulfed by serious riotingwhich was sparked by the stabbing of children outside a school. It took the country's police force by surprise, and the government's response to the riot was widely criticised. Earlier this month, Mr Varadkar's government suffered an embarrassing defeat when voters overwhelmingly rejected its bid to change the constitution through two referendums. Proposals to alter wording in the constitution to include families which are not based on marriage were defeated with 67.7% voting no. A second proposed change on the wording around the role of women in the home was defeated by a higher margin with 73.9% of voters rejecting it. It was the highest ever no vote percentage in an Irish referendum.

"President Trump went on the attack over what he sees as a bad deal for the US President Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris climate agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries. In many ways it is far worse than many observers had expected. The president clearly believes that the accord is a job killer, an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch-up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US. ""We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore,"" thundered President Trump, ""and they won't be."" He spoke of being open to re-negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement - but the idea of re-working the accord is an unlikely scenario. French President Emmanuel Macron has already dismissed the idea. ""The President said that they could continue to talk, but indicated that nothing was renegotiable with regard to the Paris accords. The United States and France will continue to work together, but not on the subject of climate change,"" sources close to the President were reported as saying. The solar industry now employs twice as many Americans as coal now does ""President Trump's speech was confused nonsense,"" said Bob Ward from the UK's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. ""He announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, while also launching negotiations to re-enter the agreement. ""But the agreement states that no country can withdraw within three years of it coming into force, and the process of withdrawal takes a further year to complete. Mr Ward continued: ""That means the United States cannot complete withdrawal from the Paris Agreement before 5 November 2020, the day after the next presidential election in the United States. So Mr Trump will not have withdrawn from the agreement within this presidential term."" The scale of President Trump's opposition to the deal is all about the money. He sees the accord as ""a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries"". This is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate sceptic perspective supported by several members of his inner circle. Others don't see climate change that way. California governor Jerry Brown and other state leaders have formed an alliance to ""live by Paris"" ""Today's decision is not only disappointing, but also highly concerning for those of us that live on the front line of climate change,"" said Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine. ""While today's decision will have grave impacts, it is not too late to act. We must not give up hope. Our children and their children deserve not only to survive, they deserve to thrive."" She added: ""That is why the rest of the world remains firmly committed to the Paris Agreement, and our own commitment to it - and that of our wider Pacific family - will never waver."" Again and again, the question of unfairness cropped up in President Trump's lengthy statement. The ""world's worst polluters"", which he argued were China and India, had ""no meaningful obligations"" placed on them by the Paris deal. Pulling the US out of the deal was, he said, his way of choosing Pittsburgh over Paris. However, the mayor of Pittsburgh rejected the association. Bill Peduto tweeted: ""I can assure you that we will follow the guideline of the Paris agreement for our people, our country & future."" The president was scathing about the green climate fund, saying it would cost billions of dollars - the US has pledged $3bn and paid around $1bn. The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to the support base that elected him but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism, especially on climate change, and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue. In an interview with the BBC, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who signed the Paris accordon behalf of the Obama administration in 2016, said of Trump's ""laughter"" comments: ""I think other countries will stop laughing at us when we don't have announcements like we had today and we have a presidency that offers America a greater vision of the possibilities of the future.""

Nadal 6-0 6-1 6-0 Basilashvil Dropping only one game against the Georgian world number 63 is a new best for Rafa at Roland Garros. Not how Basilashvili was hoping to go into the record books today... Nadal 6-0 6-1 6-0 Basilashvili Shots. Fired. Rafa Nadal shows the rest why he is the 'King of Clay'. A blistering win is wrapped up by Nadal - at the second attempt after planting is first match point into the net - in just 90 minutes.

Only after we see a quick flash of lightning and hear a loud rumble of thunder... *Nadal 6-0 6-1 5-0 Basilashvili Even the weather won't hold Rafa up. Two more break points for the Spanish fourth seed look to be wrapping up this game quick sharp. Hang on... Basilashvili battles back from 15-40. Deuce sees the Georgian beaten by more Rafa brilliance, a quick flick of that left wrist, low and angled, leaves Basilasvili only able to scramble forward and hit the net. Rafa miscalculates a forehand in the next point, before going on to rack up a third break point. This time he gets it. Basilashvili loses his head with a weak backhand into the net. Leon SmithGreat Britain Davis Cup captain on Radio 5 live sports extra It is infuriating for Nadal because he wants to wrap this match up quickly and there's the possibility that the rain might delay his progress. That seemed to distract him and his concentration dropped enough to let Basilashvili in. Nadal 6-0 6-1 4-0 Basilashvili* So close, yet so far... Nadal's sprightly jog to his bag, contrasted with a hunched-shouldered Basilashvili trudging across the baseline, tells you how deuce panned out. Rafa targets the Georgian's backhand, it pays dividends, and the fourth seed wraps up the hold after winning five points on the spin. *Nadal 6-0 6-1 3-0 Basilashvili Wooaah! Where's this come from? Nikoloz Basilashvili has mustered three break points from somewhere. Rafa wipes out the second with a sublime backhand which bends around the net post and back into play.
