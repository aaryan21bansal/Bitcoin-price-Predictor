"The Britain First Facebook page had attracted more than two million likes Facebook has removed the pages of the anti-Islamic group Britain First and its leaders. The social media company said the group had repeatedly violated its community standards. Earlier this month, Britain First's leader and deputy leader, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, were jailed after being found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. More than two million people had liked the group's Facebook page. The pages of Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen also had large followings. Facebook says the decision,externalto remove the pages was made after Britain First had ignored a final warning about the posting of material that broke its community standards. The group will not be allowed to set up a replacement page. It is understood that Facebook judged the videos and photos to be designed to incite hatred against Muslims. Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that she welcomed the move and hoped other tech companies would follow. London's mayor, Sadiq Khan has also issued a statement. ""Britain First is a vile and hate-fuelled group,"" he said. ""Their sick intentions to incite hatred within our society via social media are reprehensible, and Facebook's decision to remove their content is welcome."" It is understood the offending posts included: a photo of the group's leaders with the caption ""Islamophobic and Proud"" a caption comparing Muslim immigrants with animals multiple videos posted deliberately to incite hateful comments against Muslims In a blog, Facebook said it was an open platform for all ideas but that political views should be expressed without hate. ""People can express robust and controversial opinions without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are."" There has been pressure for some time on Facebook to act against Britain First. The Facebook pages of party leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, have also been removed The social media company says it removes hate speech against people based on their race, religion, gender and other characteristics. Its community standards document states: ""Organisations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook."" Twitter suspended the accounts of Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, after its new anti-abuse rules came into force last December.

"This video can not be played The plastic particles lurking in your bottled water Tests on major brands of bottled water have found that nearly all of them contained tiny particles of plastic. In the largest investigation of its kind, 250 bottles bought in nine different countries were examined. Research led by journalism organisationOrb Media,externaldiscovered an average of 10 plastic particles per litre, each larger than the width of a human hair. Companies whose brands were tested told the BBC that their bottling plants were operated to the highest standards. The tests were conducted at theState University of New York in Fredonia,external. Read the full scientific report [PDF],external Sherri Mason, a professor of chemistry at the university, conducted the analysis and told BBC News: ""We found [plastic] in bottle after bottle and brand after brand. ""It's not about pointing fingers at particular brands; it's really showing that this is everywhere, that plastic has become such a pervasive material in our society, and itâs pervading water - all of these products that we consume at a very basic level."" Currently, there is no evidence that ingesting very small pieces of plastic (microplastics) can cause harm, but understanding the potential implications is an active area of science. After filtration, the larger particles - yellow marks - are easy to see Commenting on the results, Prof Mason said: ""It's not catastrophic, the numbers that we're seeing, but it is concerning."" Experts have told the BBC that people in developing countries where tap water may be polluted should continue to drink water from plastic bottles. 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Earth is becoming 'Planet Plastic' Plastic pollution in seven charts Contacted to comment on the findings, the companies behind the brands have insisted that their products meet the highest standards for safety and quality. They also point to the absence of any regulations on microplastics and of the lack of standardised methods of testing for them. Last year, Prof Mason found plastic particles in samples of tap water and other researchers have spotted them in seafood, beer, sea salt and even the air. This latest work comes amid growing international attention on plastic, fuelled by the BBC's acclaimed Blue Planet 2 series in whichSir David Attenborough highlighted the threat of plastic wastein our oceans. The research into bottled water involved buying packs from 11 different global and national brands in countries chosen for their large populations or their relatively high consumption of bottled water. These were: Leading international brands: Aquafina Dasani Evian Nestle Pure Life San Pellegrino Leading national brands included: Aqua (Indonesia) Bisleri (India) Epura (Mexico) Gerolsteiner (Germany) Minalba (Brazil) Wahaha (China) A dye is used that binds to pieces of plastic To eliminate any risk of contamination, purchases in shops and deliveries to courier companies were recorded on video. Some packs in the US were ordered over the internet. The screening for plastic involved adding a dye called Nile Red to each bottle, a technique recently developed by British scientists for the rapid detection of plastic in seawater. Previous studies have established how the dye sticks to free-floating pieces of plastic and makes them fluoresce under certain wavelengths of light. Prof Mason and her colleagues filtered their dyed samples and then counted every piece larger than 100 microns â roughly the diameter of a human hair. Some of these particles â large enough to be handled individually - were then analysed by infrared spectroscopy, confirmed as plastic and further identified as particular types of polymer. Particles smaller than 100 microns â and down to a size of 6.5 microns â were much more numerous (an average of 314 per litre) and were counted using a technique developed in astronomy for totalling the number of stars in the night sky. The make-up of these particles was not confirmed but Prof Mason said they can ""rationally expected to be plastic"". This is because although Nile Red dye can bind to substances other than plastic - such as fragments of shell or algae containing lipids - these would be unlikely to be present in bottled water. Since the study has not been through the usual process of peer review and publication in a scientific journal, the BBC has asked experts in the field to comment. Dr Andrew Mayes, of the University of East Anglia and one of the pioneers of the Nile Red technique, told us it was ""very high quality analytical chemistry"" and that the results were ""quite conservative"". Michael Walker, a consultant to the Office of the UK Government Chemist and founder board member of the Food Standards Agency, said the work was ""well conducted"" and that the use of Nile Red has ""a very good pedigree"". Both of them emphasised that the particles below 100 microns had not been identified as plastic but said that since the alternatives would not be expected in bottled water, they could be described as ""probably plastic"". One obvious question is where this plastic may be coming from. Given the amount of polypropylene, which is used in bottle caps, one theory is that the act of opening a bottle may shed particles inside. To check that the process of testing was not itself adding plastic to the bottles, Prof Mason ran ""blanks"" in which the purified water used to clean the glassware and the acetone used to dilute the Nile Red dye were themselves investigated. Small quantities of plastic were found in them â believed to be from the air - but these were subtracted from the final results. A surprise to researchers was the wide variety of findings â 17 of the 259 bottles tested showed no evidence of plastic but all of the rest did, with big differences even within brands. A few bottles were found to have thousands of particles - the vast majority being the smaller ones that are ""probably plastic"" - but others from the same pack had virtually none. Prof Mason takes David Shukman through the results of the study We contacted the companies involved and most responded. Nestletold us its own internal testing for microplastics began more than two years ago and had not detected any ""above trace level"". A spokesman added that Prof Masonâs study missed key steps to avoid ""false positives"" but he invited Orb Media to compare methods. Gerolsteineralso said it had been testing its water for microplastics for a number of years and that the results showed levels ""significantly below the limits for particles"" set for pharmaceutical companies. It said it could not understand how Prof Masonâs study reached its conclusions. It also said its measures exceeded industry standards but added that microparticles are ""everywhere"" so ""the possibility of them entering the product from ambient air or packaging materials during the bottling process can therefore not be completely ruled out"". Coca-Colasaid it had some of the most stringent quality standards in the industry and used a ""multi-step filtration process"". But it too acknowledged that microplastics ""appear to be ubiquitous and therefore may be found at minute levels even in highly treated products"". Danonesaid it could not comment on the study because ""the methodology used is unclear"" but added that its own bottles had ""food grade packaging"". It pointed out that there are no regulations on microplastics or a scientific consensus on how to test for them, and it also highlighted a much smaller German study last year that found plastic particles in single use bottles but not above a statistically significant amount. PepsiCosaid Aquafina had ""rigorous quality control measures sanitary manufacturing practices, filtration and other food safety mechanisms which yield a reliably safe product"". It described the science of microplastics as ""an emerging field, in its infancy, which requires further scientific analysis, peer-reviewed research and greater collaboration across many stakeholders"".

"Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has said he is prepared to resign if the president accepts that the current coalition can continue for the rest of its term without early elections. Mr Fico said he was ready to present a candidate for PM from his party. It comes amid a political scandal caused by the murder of a journalist. Jan Kuciak was investigating government corruption when he was killed. His fiancÃ©e, Martina Kusnirova, was also murdered in an attack at their home. The couple were found dead last month. ""Today I have offered my resignation to the president of the republic,"" Mr Fico told a news briefing. ""If the president accepts it, I am ready to resign tomorrow."" Interior Minister Robert Kalinak resigned two days ago, bowing to pressure from a coalition partner, the Most-Hid party. The killings have gripped Slovakia, leading to calls for an investigation andanti-government protests in Bratislava on Fridaywhich were thought to be the largest in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. Slovakia grapples with murdered journalist's last story Slovakia shocked by killing of journalist and partner Mr Kuciak had been working on a piece linking high-level political corruption in Slovakia with Italian mafia before he was killed. Kuciak claimed that Italian businessmen with links to the Calabrian organised crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta had settled in eastern Slovakia, and had spent years embezzling EU funds. The killing of the couple triggered calls for fresh anti-corruption demonstrations Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska called for a ""radical reconstruction"" of the government or fresh elections last week, after all seven suspects arrested in connection with the murders were released without charge. One of the men released was an Italian who had done business deals with officials close to Mr Fico. The week before, Maria Troskova, the prime minister's chief state adviser, and Viliam Jasan, the secretary of the state security council, quit amid allegations about past dealings with the man. In a joint statement, the pair denied wrongdoing. They said they were stepping down during the investigation so their names would not be used in a political battle against Mr Fico. The third party in the coalition, the Slovak National Party, announced after the resignation that they would want early elections should Most-Hid stop supporting Mr Fico, or if Mr Fico lost his majority in parliament. Both Kuciak and his girlfriend were discovered with single fatal gunshot wounds, police say Journalistâs final story rocks Slovakia Slovakia sees biggest protest in decades Slovak leaders row over reporter killing Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"A classroom in an unidentified unregistered school, photographed by Ofsted inspectors Ministers are promising new measures to crack down on illegal schools, including new powers for Ofsted to seize evidence and question witnesses. A new legal obligation for schools to register will be created ""as soon as possible"" under the proposals. The move follows concerns some ultra orthodox Jewish and Muslim children are being denied a basic education. Ofsted currently struggles to gather evidence to prosecute people running illegal schools. Both the current Chief Inspector of Schools, Amanda Spielman, and her predecessor Michael Wilshaw, have told the BBC they needed stronger powers. A recent BBC investigation highlighted frustration about the lack of legal powers and loopholes in the law. Should a school be in a place like this? Abuse concerns over unregistered schools Ofsted told the BBC, its inspector had to watch while children were ushered out the back door by adults who disappeared. By the end of January this year a specialist team of inspectors had uncovered 176 places it said were operating as schools but were not registered. While many have been identified as Jewish or Muslim, 43% are providing an alternative to mainstream school for excluded children. The government is proposing to legislate to require anywhere where children spend more than 18 hours to register as a school. This stops short of the measures proposed by ministers in 2015 which did not specify school hours. The rules on illegal schools are woefully inadequate, inspectors say Mosques and some Christian groups expressed concern this would force routine religious instruction in madrasas or Sunday schools to be regulated. England's Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government wanted to ensure all children learned ""the values that underpin our society, including fairness, tolerance and respect"". ""These are values that help knit our communities together, which is why education is at the heart of this strategy. ""It's also important that children are taught in a safe environment and that we can act quickly if children are at risk or being encouraged to undermine these values. Together, with Ofsted and communities across the country, we will build on the work already underway to achieve this."" However, a lack of parliamentary time means this might not happen before the next election. And without greater legal clarity it might still prove difficult to bring prosecutions even with stronger powers for Ofsted. Some unregistered settings have been operating in a grey area of the law with parents insisting they are part of home education. The government says it will clarify the regulations on home education, but is not planning to change them.

"Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists in the world, but what about his discoveries? His fame among researchers was founded on a series of studies that wed Albert Einstein's great theory of gravity, general relativity, with the strange world of quantum mechanics, normally applied to tiny things like atoms and molecules. What Hawking ended up with were descriptions of black holes that could boil themselves out of existence, and equations that described the entire history of the Universe in a single sweep. With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These tiny black holes would have been incredibly hot, shedding mass until they vanished - potentially ending their lives in a powerful explosion. In the 70s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light entering a black hole were destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved. With the physicist James Hartle, he tried to describe the history of the cosmos in one mathematical expression. But quantum theory shows that the distinctions between space and time are unclear. As a result, the proposal showed there was little point asking what happened before the Big Bang. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates Hawkingâs first forays into science publication were as a student in the 1960s when heâd had only the first intimations of the motor neurone disease that would become such a big part of his life. With Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - in physicist-speak, a âsingularityâ. At the time, when the still cooling afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation) had only just been detected on the sky, other cosmologists had hoped for something less radical than the notion of an entire Universe emerging out of nothing. Together, Hawking and Penrose showed the quest for gentler answers was hopeless. Hawkingâs next venture, in the 1970s, was to show that black holes are not black at all, but are in fact, as the title of one paper put it, âwhite hotâ. Black holes are the ultimate monster of general relativity. First conceived and named by John Wheeler, they are regions of space so dense that everything within their realm collapses to a single point â another example of a singularity. At the time, it seemed ridiculous that these gorgons of gravity should have anything to do with the delicate theory of quantum mechanics, designed to explain light and the orbits of electrons in atoms. With Roger Penrose, Hawking showed that the Big Bang must have started from an infinitely small point But Hawking showed otherwise. In fact, quantum theory completely changes the fate of black holes. At their very fringes, Hawking demonstrated, black holes would create and radiate new particles due to these laws, losing energy, and hence losing mass (remember Einstein's equation E=mcÂ²). It would take a black hole a very long time to evaporate in this way, but in its last moments Hawking said it would expire in a burst of energy equivalent to a million megaton hydrogen bombs. When the Large Hadron Collider was opened in the Swiss/French countryside outside Geneva, there was hope that the particle accelerator might be able to create microscopic black holes and so prove Hawking's ideas. A Nobel Prize would then have been a certainty. But the LHC has seen nothing yet. Having tackled single black holes, Hawking turned his attention to the Universe as a whole - the ultimate, inescapable gravitational container. The laws of quantum science are as applicable here as to a vanishing black hole, especially at the first moment, the Big Bang. While other researchers struggled to depict a brief moment in the life of a molecule using quantum laws, Hawking showed it was possible to encapsulate the entire history of the whole Universe in a single mathematical expression â âThe Wavefunction of the Universeâ, as he called it. Because the expression is self-contained - it starts at a singularity at the beginning of time and is closed by another at the end of time, and if necessary, history can bounce back and forth between these two book ends. There is no need, indeed no point, to ask what happened before the Big Bang. An existing Universe would explain itself on its own terms. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Hawking continued working on the ramifications of this theory to the end of his life. To know that such a mathematical description might exist is one thing; to know which expression is the right one is a far harder job. Stephen Hawkingâs mind was not the all-conquering juggernaut of public myth. Like any scientist, he got it wrong from time to time, and often had to concede defeat in intellectual combat. We sometimes know of this because of his predilection for laying down fanciful bets over debated points â a yearâs subscription to Playboy versus one for Private Eye, in one instance. This happened in 2004, when he conceded to computer scientist John Preskill that black holes were not the ultimate information shredders in the Universe (a consequence he perceived of his black hole theories that would have undermined some of the most fundamental laws of physics). Hawking accepted black holes could store information about their past, encoded somehow at their edges - the so-called event horizon. Many researchers were frustrated by the ease with which Stephen Hawking generated publicity, often overshadowing other talents with equally extraordinary or challenging ideas. His papers were typically at the extremes of mathematical science, a further step along the path heâd chosen to follow in his student days; but they were not always close to the central scientific issues of the day. Nevertheless, his ability to project his intellectual enthusiasm beyond his frail body, and to draw the wider public into abstruse realms of science is undeniable.

"Stephen Hawking was the most remarkable author I had the privilege of working with during my career as the director of science publishing at Cambridge University Press. In 1982, I had responsibility for his third academic book for the Press, Superspace And Supergravity. This was a messy collection of papers from a technical workshop on how to devise a new theory of gravity. While that book was in production, I suggested he try something easier: a popular book about the nature of the Universe, suitable for the general market. Stephen mulled over my suggestion. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates He already had an international reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist working on rotating black holes and theories of gravity. And he had concerns about financial matters: importantly, it was impossible for him to obtain any form of life insurance to protect his family in the event of his death or becoming total dependent on nursing care. So, he took precious time out from his research to prepare the rough draft of a book. Ten million copies in all editions and translations At the time, several bestselling physics authors had already published non-technical books on the early Universe and black holes. Stephen decided to write a more personal approach, by explaining his own research in cosmology and quantum theory. As he himself pointed out it, his area of interest had ""become so technical that only a very small number of specialists could master the mathematics"" used to describe it. For a starting point, he took some themes from a course of advanced lectures that he had recently given at Harvard University. These had catchy titles such as ""The edge of spacetime"", ""Black holes and  thermodynamics"", and ""Quantum gravity"". In the 1980s, my office and Stephen's were in the same courtyard in central Cambridge, so I often chatted with him about publishing. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking One afternoon he invited me to take a look at the first draft, but first he wanted to discuss cash. He told me he had spent considerable time away from his research, and that he expected advances and royalties to be large. When I pressed him on the market that he foresaw, he insisted that it had to be on sale, up front, at all airport bookshops in the UK and the US. I told him that was a tough call for a university press. Then I thumbed the typescript. To my dismay, the text was far too technical for a general reader. A few weeks later he showed me a revision, much improved, but still littered with equations. I said: ""Steve, it's still too technical - every equation will halve the market."" He eventually removed all except one, E = mcÂ². And he decided, fortunately, to place it with a mass market publisher rather than a university press. Bantam published A Brief History of Time in March 1988. Sales took off like a rocket, and it ranked as a bestseller for at least five years. Total sales approached 10 million copies. The book's impact on the popularisation of science has been incalculable. Stephen was an inspirational ambassador for the power of science to provide rational accounts of the physical laws governing the natural world.

"This video can not be played Scientist in the public eye Scientists, politicians and actors have paid tribute to world renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who has been called an ""inspiration to millions"". The British scientist, famed for his work on black holes,died peacefully at his home in Cambridge aged 76. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, one of the world's most eminent scientists, described his life as a ""triumph"". Others described him as a ""unique individual"" whose death ""has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake"". Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21 and was told he had only a few years to live. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures 'You could ask my dad anything' Stephen Hawking in quotes Cambridge remembers: 'I made some space for Stephen Hawking' Stephen Hawking: What you need to know He was known for his theories on black holes and relativity and went on to publish several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. The University of Cambridge, where Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as ""an inspiration to millions"". Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family. Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: ""His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever."" Stephen Hawking, who was born in 1942, studied physics in Oxford and later went on to Cambridge for his postgraduate research in cosmology This video can not be played Stephen Hawking's daughter Lucy: 'You could ask my dad any question' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, broadcaster Prof Brian Cox called him ""one of the greats"" and said physicists in 1,000 years' time ""will still be talking about Hawking radiation"", his theory about black holes. British astronaut Tim Peake, who flew in space in 2016, said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". And the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, praised Prof Hawking's ""colossal mind and wonderful spirit"". Many friends and fans have also hailed his humour, with actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in 2014 film biopic The Theory of Everything, calling him ""the funniest man I have ever met"". Fellow actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who also played the physicist in a 2004 BBC TV film, remembered his ""wickedly funny sense of humour"". ""He virtually created the publishing genre of popular science. I will miss our margaritas but will raise one to the stars to celebrate your life,"" he added. Benedict Cumberbatch said Prof Hawking was a ""true inspiration for me and for millions around the world"" Meanwhile, Lord Rees - who holds the most prestigious post in astronomy in the UK -recalled meeting Prof Hawking at Cambridge University in 1964,external, describing him as ""unsteady on his feet and speaking with great difficulty"" following his diagnosis with the degenerative disease. ""Even mere survival would have been a medical marvel, but of course he didn't just survive.  He became one of the most famous scientists in the world,"" Lord Rees said ""He was diagnosed with a deadly disease, and his expectations dropped to zero. He himself said that everything that happened since then was a bonus."" ""And what a triumph his life has been,"" Lord Rees added.

""As his children have said, his courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world,"" she said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute to the physicist -who was a Labour supporter- and said he ""inspired the world with his determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos"" and ""showed breathtaking courage to overcome life's adversities"". Former US President Barack Obama, who Prof Hawking met in 2009 to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, tweeted a photo of them both alongside the words: ""Have fun out there among the stars"".

Many people have praised Prof Hawking's contribution to popular culture, with Oxford University biologist Sally Le Page remarking he was ""as much as a cultural icon as a scientific one"". According to online retailer Amazon, Prof Hawking's book A Brief History of Time has risen to the top of its best sellers list following the announcement of his death on Wednesday. With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy In the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved The Royal Albert Hall said the ""genius"" Prof Hawking was the second physicist, after Albert Einstein in 1933, to ever sell out the venue with his lecture in 1995. The Motor Neurone Disease Association said Prof Hawking ""played a vital role"" in raising awareness of the disease, which kills more than half of people within two years of diagnosis.

"Stephen Hawking - who died aged 76 - battled motor neurone disease to become one of the most respected and best-known scientists of his age. A man of great humour, he became a popular ambassador for science and was always careful to ensure that the general public had ready access to his work. His book A Brief History of Time became an unlikely best-seller although it is unclear how many people actually managed to get to the end of it. He appeared in a number of popular TV shows and lent his synthesised voice to various recordings. Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford on 8 January 1942. His father, a research biologist, had moved with his mother from London to escape German bombing. Hawking grew up in London and St Albans and, after gaining a first-class degree in physics from Oxford, went on to Cambridge for postgraduate research in cosmology. A life in pictures Stephen Hawking in quotes Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Trump stance could damage Earth - Hawking As a teenager he had enjoyed horse-riding and rowing but while at Cambridge he was diagnosed with a form of motor neurone disease which was to leave him almost completely paralysed. As he was preparing to marry his first wife, Jane, in 1964 his doctors gave him no more than two or three years of life. But the disease progressed more slowly than expected. The couple had three children, and in 1988 - although Hawking was by now only able to speak with a voice synthesiser following a tracheotomy - he had completed A Brief History of Time - a layman's guide to cosmology. It sold more than 10 million copies, although its author was aware that it was dubbed ""the most popular book never read"". He received honorary degrees, medals, prizes and awards throughout his career and was honoured with a CBE in 1982. He was reportedly offered a knighthood in the 1990s but later revealed he had turned it down over issues with the government's funding for science. This video can not be played Scientist in the public eye Hawking discovered the phenomenon which became known as Hawking radiation, where black holes leak energy and fade to nothing. He was renowned for his extraordinary capacity to visualise scientific solutions without calculation or experiment. But it was perhaps his ""theory of everything"", suggesting that the universe evolves according to well-defined laws, that attracted most attention. ""This complete set of laws can give us the answers to questions like how did the universe begin,"" he said. ""Where is it going and will it have an end? If so, how will it end? If we find the answers to these questions, we really shall know the mind of God."" He believed the universe evolves according to well-defined laws Hawking's celebrity status was acknowledged even by The Simpsons - he was depicted drinking at a bar with Homer, suggesting he might steal Homer's idea that the universe is shaped like a doughnut. He appeared in a special documentary about BBC comedy series Red Dwarf during which he spoke about why he enjoyed the show and also starred in Star Trek: The Next Generation as a hologram of his image. The rock group Pink Floyd used his distinctive synthesised voice for the introduction to Keep Talking, on their 1994 album The Division Bell. Undeterred by his condition, he continued his work as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, and in 2001, his second book - Universe in a Nutshell - was published. He believed his illness brought some benefits; he said before he developed the disease he had been bored with life. But his condition inevitably made him dependent on others. He often paid tribute to his wife, who had looked after him for more than 20 years, and friends and relatives were shocked when he left her for one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, whom he married in 1995. The couple later divorced in 2006. Hawking later went on to marry one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They were married for 11 years before they divorced By 2000, Hawking was a frequent visitor to the emergency department of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, seeking treatment for a variety of injuries. Police questioned several people about allegations that he had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse over a period of years. He was known to be an erratic, almost reckless driver of his electric wheelchair, and Hawking insisted his injuries were not caused by abuse. No action was taken. In 2007, he became the first quadriplegic to experience weightlessness on board the so-called ""vomit comet"", a modified plane specially designed to simulate zero gravity. He said he did it to encourage interest in space travel and booked a seat on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic sub-orbital space plane. ""I believe that life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, or other dangers. I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."" Eddie Redmayne played Hawking in The Theory of Everything In 2014, the film The Theory of Everything was released, based on Jane Hawking's account of their courtship and marriage. Hawking himself met Eddie Redmayne as part of the actor's preparation for taking on the role of the scientist. In a series for the Discovery Channel, he said it was perfectly rational to assume there was intelligent life elsewhere but warned that aliens might just raid earth of its resources and then move on. Hawking also predicted the end of humanity from global warming, a large comet or a new virus. He collaborated with Russian investor Yuri Milner in 2015 to work on projects to find evidence of alien life. He once wrote that he had motor neurone disease for practically all his adult life but said that it had not stopped him having an attractive family and being successful in his work.

"The professor was a fellow at Gonville and Caius College for more than 50 years As the world mourns the death of Stephen Hawking, in Cambridge - where he lived and worked - people remember a familiar face often spotted on the streets and in the university's halls. In the wake of the news, the mood in the city was not so much sombre, as one in which many recalled a visionary who had touched the lives of residents, students and academics. From ""I spotted him once in the pub"", to ""I've heard some of his inspirational talks"", the scientist was synonymous with the city, which bears the mark of his legacy. A bust in his likeness sits in Cambridge University's Centre for Theoretical Cosmology and the Stephen Hawking Building was named after Gonville and Caius College's most celebrated fellow. Outside the very site which housed his accommodation when he joined as a PhD student in 1962 is a simple sign announcing his death. Countless passers-by stop on their way to work, or to the shops, and pause to read it. ""His work is a testament to human determination,"" says history student Maddy Ducharme. Her thoughts echo many of those who have lined up to sign a book of condolence opened by the college. The theoretical physicist described Caius as ""a constant thread running through my life"" Student Maddy Ducharme says the professor showed ""such determination"" Some of those now studying at the university were inspired to study science by the professor, including physics student Arno Liu. ""When I was 12 my mum bought me A Brief History of Time. ""He wrote it in a very humorous way which kept me focused on the ideas he had. He was one of the reasons I got dragged into physics."" Obituary: Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures China's love for the late Stephen Hawking The 17-year-old was one of those who queued to sign the book of condolence. ""I quoted a Dylan Thomas poem, Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night. It's written for people not to give up, but to fight on in life."" Although he had not met the professor, Mr Liu was among those who attended Prof Hawking's 75th birthday celebrations at Gonville and Caius last year. ""Everybody was trying to chat with him but seeing him was enough for me,"" he adds. The flag flies at half mast on Prof Hawking's college, Gonville and Caius Student Amy Edwards-Knight went to the professor's birthday party last year Caius' law student Amy Edwards-Knight, 21, was also there and remembers a ""gorgeous piece of music"" which had been composed to mark the occasion. ""They had the choir perform and he gave a really lovely speech. ""He talked about what Caius had done for him, and his connections to the college, and waxed lyrical about the abilities of really understanding the universe and how he didn't think that he ultimately ever did, completely."" A bust of Prof Hawking was unveiled at his college in 2007 History student Evan Adair said Prof Hawking helped everyone to better understand the world ""I sat pretty close to him in the hall,"" adds Evan Adair, a 21-year-old student at the college. ""For me it was special. I'm a historian - I'm not a scientist - but I know that he's made a really big contribution to the way that we understand the world today."" Despite his failing health the professor still attended dinners in the college, and Caius' bar worker Jesus Gorjon remembers being asked to make room for a certain guest on one occasion. ""I was doing a dinner at the college and my boss told me to make some space for 'Stephen' and I said 'OK'. ""I didn't know who 'Stephen' was, but when I saw it was him, I was like, 'oh, I've made some space for Stephen Hawking'."" Jesus Gorjon is proud to have been asked to make room for Prof Hawking in the college dining hall The professor also surprised TV actor Stephen McGann, who ran into him at Antonio Carluccio's restaurant in Cambridge. Paying tribute on Twitter,external, the Call the Midwife star said: ""To anybody who lives in or near Cambridge, Stephen Hawking was a constant reminder of brilliance that wants to share the same air. ""You would come across him in the street - in cafes or shops. I last saw him at the next table in Carluccio's. I'll miss that."" Allow Twitter content?

As people mourn the passing of the man whom many held in awe, those in his home city are fondly remembering a familiar man about town. Several recall  ""coming across"" the scientist in the street. ""He ran over my foot years ago on King's Parade,"" one wrote on Twitter. Another replied: ""I can top that - I nearly crashed into him on my bike."" But Ms Ducharme sums it up for many when she says: ""Professor Hawking showed such inspiration, such determination.

"I was lucky enough to meet Prof Stephen Hawking several times. Each time it was a joy. There was a marvellous twinkle in his eye and always a mischievous sense of humour. It was these qualities and his determination not to allow his disability to prevent him from contributing to research that made him so famous and indeed so loved by people all across the world. I first went to interview Prof Hawking in 2004 at his office in Cambridge. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates I felt a mixture of awe and excitement as I waited for the man who for years had been my idol. He seemed to smile at me as he entered the room which immediately put me at my ease. The camera operator I was with wanted to make a last minute adjustment to his lighting and so he asked Prof Hawking's staff if he could pull out one of the plugs in the office so that he could use the socket for his equipment. Without waiting for a response he pulled the plug and the room was filled with a deafening siren. Prof Hawking then slouched forward and I feared that my colleague had inadvertently unplugged a vital piece of life-support equipment. Fortunately, it was the alarm to the uninterruptable power supply to his office computer and he was slouched forward with mirth at our incompetence. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Thankfully, he invited me to interview him many times after that. We talked a lot about his science of course. But what I remember most was his humanity. As well as his own work he would often talk about the social implications of research and the responsibility scientists had to make sure that their work was used for  the benefit of society. And it was for this that he became the world's most famous scientist. He reached people not normally interested in science because of his compassion as well as his genius. And that wicked sense of humour. When I asked him how we could test his belief that radiation emerged from black holes, he told me that he did not wish to get too close to a black hole for fear of falling in - but he did agree that it would be a wonderful way to go.

"Stephen Hawking visits the White House in 1998 World-renowned for his scientific work, Prof Stephen Hawking was also a keen student of politics, with sometimes controversial views. Prof Hawking campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, warning Brexit would be a ""disaster"" for science funding. After the referendum, he said he was ""sad about the result"", inan article for the Guardian,external, warning against the ""envy and isolationism"" he said had driven it and arguing for a fairer sharing of wealth ""both within nations and across national borders"". He was able to joke about it a few months later, at the Pride of Britain awards, when Theresa May presented him with a lifetime achievement award, describing him as ""a man who has quite simply changed the way we look at the world"". ""Thank you prime minister for those very kind words,"" he said, through his voice synthesiser. ""I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit."" It brought the house down. Visionary physicist Stephen Hawking dies Obituary: Stephen Hawking Reaction to his death The great astrophysicist got into an epic feud with Jeremy Hunt last year, after the health secretaryaccused him of spreading ""pernicious falsehoods"" about the NHS,externalin a speech the scientist gave to the Royal Society of Medicine. In an article for the Guardian,external, Prof Hawking argued that the NHS, which had saved his life, was being destroyed by ""underfunding and cuts, privatising services, the public sector pay cap, the new contract imposed on junior doctors, and removal of the student nurses' bursary"". Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures Prof Hawking was a long-time supporter of the Labour Party, although he was not, it seems, a fan of Jeremy Corbyn. ""I regard Corbyn as a disaster,"" he said last year. ""His heart is in the right place and many of his policies are sound, but he has allowed himself to be portrayed as a left-wing extremist."" He was, nevertheless, persuaded to endorse Labour's candidate in Cambridge, Daniel Zeichner, at last June's general election. Asked on ITV's Good Morning Britain programme in May 2016 to account for the rise of US President Donald Trump, he said: ""I can't. He is a demagogue, who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator."" With his gift for explaining the mysteries of the universe in an entertaining and accessible way, Prof Hawking was much in demand as a public speaker. In 1998, he was invited to the White House to address then President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and an audience including several notable American physicists. ""I don't believe science-fiction like Star Trek, where people are essentially the same 400 years in the future,"" he told them. ""I think the human race and its DNA will increase in complexity quite rapidly."" The event was ""transmitted over the World Wide Web"", as thefledgling BBC News website put it at the time.,external This video can not be played Professor Stephen Hawking:""I think everyone should have the right to choose to end their life"" In 2014, Prof Hawkinglent his support to a bill by Labour peer Lord Falconerthat, if successful, would have allowed doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live. He said it would be ""wrong to despair and commit suicide, unless one is in great pain, but that is a matter of choice"". ""We should not take away the freedom of the individual to choose to die."" But he admitted that he had once briefly tried to end his life when he had had a tracheostomy - an operation to fit a breathing tube. ""I briefly tried to commit suicide by not breathing. However, the reflex to breathe was too strong."" In 2004, Prof Hawking read out the names of people killed in the Iraq War, at a anti-war vigil in Trafalgar Square. ""The war was based on two lies,"" he told the crowd. ""It has been a tragedy for all the families. If that is not a war crime, what is?"" He added: ""I apologise for my pronunciation. My speech synthesiser was not designed for Iraqi names."" In 2007, Prof Hawking fronted a campaign by scientists, Church leaders, actors and writers to urge then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to cancel Trident. ""Nuclear war remains the greatest danger to the survival of the human race,"" he said. ""To replace Trident would make it more difficult to get arms reduction, and increase the risk. ""It would also be a complete waste of money because there are no circumstances in which we would use it independently."" In 1998, Prof Hawking sparked controversy by defending the use of animals in medical research. ""The fuss over the use of animals in medical research is ridiculous,"" he said. ""Why is it worse to use animal experiments to save lives than to eat them, which the majority of the population are happy to do? ""I suspect that extremists turn to animal rights from a lack of the more worthwhile causes of the past, like nuclear disarmament.""

"This video can not be played The scientist is the voice of the latest version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For all of his academic work on mind-boggling scientific concepts, Stephen Hawking was also known to many for something else: his many cameos on TV, film and radio. His most recent was broadcast just last week, as the voice of the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy Mark II - a powerful being known on our planet as Prof Hawking. ""I have been quite popular in my time,"" the character says in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation. ""Some even read my books."" It's that self-deprecating humour that characterised Prof Hawking's appearances. Here's a brief look at some of them. The Simpsons Prof Hawking once commented that ""almost as many people know me through The Simpsons as through my science"". Whether that's true is debatable - but his stints on the long-running cartoon have been among his most memorable guest appearances. He first appeared in 1999 episode They Saved Lisa's Brain, with his wheelchair loaded with gadgets. He not only knocks out Principal Skinner, using a boxing glove on a spring, but then flies off with the help of helicopter blades, saving Lisa Simpson from a collapsing bandstand in the process. He also tells Homer his doughnut-shaped universe theory is ""intriguing"" - and that he may steal it. ""I hope I wouldn't use the boxing glove - though sometimes I am sorely tempted,"" he said. ""But helicopter blades would be very useful."" His cartoon self came about as his daughter Lucy knew one of the scriptwriters. ""The episode was very funny,"" he added. Little Britain for Comic Relief Prof Hawking with David Walliams and Catherine Tate Prof Hawking had the mother of all wheelchair adaptations when it allowed him to become a transformer-type machine in a Little Britain sketch for Comic Relief. He's seen being pushed through the grounds of a college at the University of Cambridge by Lou Todd - usually seen with wheelchair user Andy Pipkin. When Prof Hawking gets fed up with Lou's patronising chat (about Peppa Pig, among other things), he says: ""Professor Stephen Hawking bot, transform"". He blasts Catherine Tate (playing an equally patronising nun) with a ray gun before chasing after Lou and turning the gun on him, before leaving the scene with a ""ha ha ha"". The Big Bang Theory Sheldon gets to hand over his paper on the Higgs boson to his idol in The Hawking Excitation - which has also seen Howard working on Prof Hawking's wheelchair when he comes to their university to lecture. When Sheldon meets Prof Hawking, he tells him it's an ""honour and a privilege"" to meet him - to which Prof Hawking replies: ""I know."" He then goes on to tell Sheldon he's made a mistake in one of his calculations, causing Sheldon to faint. ""Great, another fainter,"" he says. In another episode, The Extract Obliteration, he appears making a phone call to Sheldon - having played a game of Words With Friends online with him. He calls Sheldon ""Dr Loser"" instead of Dr Cooper and asks: ""What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck."" Comic Relief originals Allow YouTube content?

"Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists in the world, but what about his discoveries? His fame among researchers was founded on a series of studies that wed Albert Einstein's great theory of gravity, general relativity, with the strange world of quantum mechanics, normally applied to tiny things like atoms and molecules. What Hawking ended up with were descriptions of black holes that could boil themselves out of existence, and equations that described the entire history of the Universe in a single sweep. With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These tiny black holes would have been incredibly hot, shedding mass until they vanished - potentially ending their lives in a powerful explosion. In the 70s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light entering a black hole were destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved. With the physicist James Hartle, he tried to describe the history of the cosmos in one mathematical expression. But quantum theory shows that the distinctions between space and time are unclear. As a result, the proposal showed there was little point asking what happened before the Big Bang. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates Hawkingâs first forays into science publication were as a student in the 1960s when heâd had only the first intimations of the motor neurone disease that would become such a big part of his life. With Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - in physicist-speak, a âsingularityâ. At the time, when the still cooling afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation) had only just been detected on the sky, other cosmologists had hoped for something less radical than the notion of an entire Universe emerging out of nothing. Together, Hawking and Penrose showed the quest for gentler answers was hopeless. Hawkingâs next venture, in the 1970s, was to show that black holes are not black at all, but are in fact, as the title of one paper put it, âwhite hotâ. Black holes are the ultimate monster of general relativity. First conceived and named by John Wheeler, they are regions of space so dense that everything within their realm collapses to a single point â another example of a singularity. At the time, it seemed ridiculous that these gorgons of gravity should have anything to do with the delicate theory of quantum mechanics, designed to explain light and the orbits of electrons in atoms. With Roger Penrose, Hawking showed that the Big Bang must have started from an infinitely small point But Hawking showed otherwise. In fact, quantum theory completely changes the fate of black holes. At their very fringes, Hawking demonstrated, black holes would create and radiate new particles due to these laws, losing energy, and hence losing mass (remember Einstein's equation E=mcÂ²). It would take a black hole a very long time to evaporate in this way, but in its last moments Hawking said it would expire in a burst of energy equivalent to a million megaton hydrogen bombs. When the Large Hadron Collider was opened in the Swiss/French countryside outside Geneva, there was hope that the particle accelerator might be able to create microscopic black holes and so prove Hawking's ideas. A Nobel Prize would then have been a certainty. But the LHC has seen nothing yet. Having tackled single black holes, Hawking turned his attention to the Universe as a whole - the ultimate, inescapable gravitational container. The laws of quantum science are as applicable here as to a vanishing black hole, especially at the first moment, the Big Bang. While other researchers struggled to depict a brief moment in the life of a molecule using quantum laws, Hawking showed it was possible to encapsulate the entire history of the whole Universe in a single mathematical expression â âThe Wavefunction of the Universeâ, as he called it. Because the expression is self-contained - it starts at a singularity at the beginning of time and is closed by another at the end of time, and if necessary, history can bounce back and forth between these two book ends. There is no need, indeed no point, to ask what happened before the Big Bang. An existing Universe would explain itself on its own terms. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Hawking continued working on the ramifications of this theory to the end of his life. To know that such a mathematical description might exist is one thing; to know which expression is the right one is a far harder job. Stephen Hawkingâs mind was not the all-conquering juggernaut of public myth. Like any scientist, he got it wrong from time to time, and often had to concede defeat in intellectual combat. We sometimes know of this because of his predilection for laying down fanciful bets over debated points â a yearâs subscription to Playboy versus one for Private Eye, in one instance. This happened in 2004, when he conceded to computer scientist John Preskill that black holes were not the ultimate information shredders in the Universe (a consequence he perceived of his black hole theories that would have undermined some of the most fundamental laws of physics). Hawking accepted black holes could store information about their past, encoded somehow at their edges - the so-called event horizon. Many researchers were frustrated by the ease with which Stephen Hawking generated publicity, often overshadowing other talents with equally extraordinary or challenging ideas. His papers were typically at the extremes of mathematical science, a further step along the path heâd chosen to follow in his student days; but they were not always close to the central scientific issues of the day. Nevertheless, his ability to project his intellectual enthusiasm beyond his frail body, and to draw the wider public into abstruse realms of science is undeniable.

"This video can not be played Scientist in the public eye Scientists, politicians and actors have paid tribute to world renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who has been called an ""inspiration to millions"". The British scientist, famed for his work on black holes,died peacefully at his home in Cambridge aged 76. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, one of the world's most eminent scientists, described his life as a ""triumph"". Others described him as a ""unique individual"" whose death ""has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake"". Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21 and was told he had only a few years to live. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures 'You could ask my dad anything' Stephen Hawking in quotes Cambridge remembers: 'I made some space for Stephen Hawking' Stephen Hawking: What you need to know He was known for his theories on black holes and relativity and went on to publish several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. The University of Cambridge, where Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as ""an inspiration to millions"". Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family. Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: ""His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever.""

British astronaut Tim Peake, who flew in space in 2016, said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". And the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, praised Prof Hawking's ""colossal mind and wonderful spirit"". Many friends and fans have also hailed his humour, with actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in 2014 film biopic The Theory of Everything, calling him ""the funniest man I have ever met"". Fellow actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who also played the physicist in a 2004 BBC TV film, remembered his ""wickedly funny sense of humour"". ""He virtually created the publishing genre of popular science. I will miss our margaritas but will raise one to the stars to celebrate your life,"" he added. Benedict Cumberbatch said Prof Hawking was a ""true inspiration for me and for millions around the world"" Meanwhile, Lord Rees - who holds the most prestigious post in astronomy in the UK -recalled meeting Prof Hawking at Cambridge University in 1964,external, describing him as ""unsteady on his feet and speaking with great difficulty"" following his diagnosis with the degenerative disease. ""Even mere survival would have been a medical marvel, but of course he didn't just survive.  He became one of the most famous scientists in the world,"" Lord Rees said ""He was diagnosed with a deadly disease, and his expectations dropped to zero. He himself said that everything that happened since then was a bonus."" ""And what a triumph his life has been,"" Lord Rees added.

This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy In the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved The Royal Albert Hall said the ""genius"" Prof Hawking was the second physicist, after Albert Einstein in 1933, to ever sell out the venue with his lecture in 1995. The Motor Neurone Disease Association said Prof Hawking ""played a vital role"" in raising awareness of the disease, which kills more than half of people within two years of diagnosis.

"This video can not be played Thousands of students protest for gun reform Students and school staff across the US are commemorating the Florida school shooting with a walkout, exactly one month after the killings. They are stopping lessons for 17 minutes in memory of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Pupils at the school, which was targeted by a former student, hugged each other on the football field. Protest organisers accuse Congress of failing to tackle gun violence. The White Houserevealed a plan this week to deter school shootingswhich does not include President Donald Trump's repeated calls to raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles to 21. Instead, it moves ahead with his controversial proposal to provide firearms training to school employees. A student fastens a pin to her friend during a rally in Brooklyn, NY Students gathered outside the White House as part of the nationwide protest The walkouts included moments of silence to remember the shooting victims Tales of heroism from Florida attack Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The walkouts began at 10:00 in the eastern US (14:00 GMT) and moved west across America's time zones. Organisers of the National School Walkout, who were also behind the Women's March in January 2017 against Mr Trump's inauguration, called on ""students, teachers, school administrators, parents and allies"" to take part. On their website,,externalthey accuse Congress of ""inaction to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing"" schools and neighbourhoods. Schools taking part included Colorado's Columbine High School where 13 people were shot dead by two students in 1999. ""I should be writing my college essay, not my will"" a student's sign in New York says Students in the Washington DC area marched to Congress and the White House Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School walked to the football field In Parkland, families and supporters applauded as thousands of students slowly marched on to the Stoneman Douglas school football field. School principal Ty Thompson called on them to stage the ""biggest group hug"". A large crowd of students from the Washington DC area gathered outside the White House holding signs reading ""Protect People Not Guns"" and chanting ""Never again"" and ""Enough is enough"". Some students also gathered at Capitol Hill where they were addressed by the Senate and House Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. ""We're all moved by your eloquence and your fearless insistence on action to prevent gun violence,"" Ms Pelosi told them. ""Thank you for bringing your urgency to this fight, to the doorstep of America, the doorstep of the Capitol of the United States."" Students in suburban Chicago honoured members of their own community who have been killed with guns Students in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, stood in a heart formation to pay tribute to the Parkland victims. In New York, hundreds of students from Fiorello H LaGuardia High School - many dressed in orange, the colour of the gun-control movement - took to the streets of Manhattan. ""Thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" read one sign. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also joined protesters for a symbolic ""die-in"" - lying down in a street in Lower Manhattan.

The disruption to the school day is opposed by some schools, notably in one Texas district where students who walk out have been told they face a three-day suspension. ""We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved,"" said Needville schools superintendent Curtis Rhode. In New Jersey, student Rosa Rodriquez has reportedly received a suspension after disobeying the school's order to remain in the auditorium to mark the walkout. A North Carolina student - who was apparently the only one of his classmates to leave - tweeted a video of himself outside his school which has now received thousands of shares.

The attack on Valentine's Day, 14 February, was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. The former pupil arrived on campus and began shooting students and staff before abandoning the weapon and escaping, according to court documents. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' Fourteen students and three members of staff died. US prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the attacker who has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened The US House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 407-10 in support of a bill to authorise $50m (Â£36m) in federal grants for training, anonymous reporting systems, threat assessments, intervention teams and school and police coordination. It does not address gun control. It is unclear when the Senate, which is expected to take up a separate measure to strengthen background checks for gun buyers, will consider the bill. US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi addressed students outside the US Capitol The House measure would not allow the approved funding to be used to arm teachers or school personnel, a provision the White House has backed. President Trump tweeted his support of the bill on Wednesday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes The founder of a US start-up that promised to revolutionise blood testing has agreed to settle charges that she raised over $700m (Â£500m) fraudulently. The Securities and Exchange Commission, a top US financial regulator, said,externalElizabeth Holmes and Theranos deceived investors about the firm's technology. The agency also said the firm had falsely claimed its products had been used by the US army in Afghanistan. Ms Holmes will lose control of the firm and be fined $500,000. An SEC official called the fallout an ""important lesson for Silicon Valley"". ""Innovators who seek to revolutionise and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today - not just what they hope it might do someday,"" said Jina Choi, director of the SEC's San Francisco regional office. Theranos was founded in 2003 when Ms Holmes was only 19, and sought to develop an innovative blood testing device. The firm said its Edison device could test for conditions such as cancer and cholesterol with only a few drops of blood from a finger-prick, rather than taking vials from a vein. In 2015 Forbes magazine estimated Ms Holmes' wealth at $4.5bn However, in the same year reports in the Wall Street Journal suggested the devices were flawed and inaccurate. Theranos will shut labs and cut 40% staff By 2016 Forbes had revised its estimates of Ms Holmes' fortune to ""nothing"". Theranos' California headquarters The charges were brought against Theranos and its former president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as well as Ms Holmes. The SEC plans to bring a case against Mr Balwani. The regulator alleged that Theranos, Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani made a series of false and misleading statements in investor presentations, product demonstrations and interviews. It said: ""Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos' products were deployed by the US Department of Defence on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100m in revenue in 2014. ""In truth, Theranos' technology was never deployed by the US Department of Defence and generated a little more than $100,000 in revenue from operations in 2014... ""In truth, according to the SEC's complaint, Theranos' proprietary analyser could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standard commercial analysers manufactured by others.""

"This video can not be played The scientist is the voice of the latest version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For all of his academic work on mind-boggling scientific concepts, Stephen Hawking was also known to many for something else: his many cameos on TV, film and radio. His most recent was broadcast just last week, as the voice of the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy Mark II - a powerful being known on our planet as Prof Hawking. ""I have been quite popular in my time,"" the character says in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation. ""Some even read my books."" It's that self-deprecating humour that characterised Prof Hawking's appearances. Here's a brief look at some of them. The Simpsons Prof Hawking once commented that ""almost as many people know me through The Simpsons as through my science"". Whether that's true is debatable - but his stints on the long-running cartoon have been among his most memorable guest appearances. He first appeared in 1999 episode They Saved Lisa's Brain, with his wheelchair loaded with gadgets. He not only knocks out Principal Skinner, using a boxing glove on a spring, but then flies off with the help of helicopter blades, saving Lisa Simpson from a collapsing bandstand in the process. He also tells Homer his doughnut-shaped universe theory is ""intriguing"" - and that he may steal it. ""I hope I wouldn't use the boxing glove - though sometimes I am sorely tempted,"" he said. ""But helicopter blades would be very useful."" His cartoon self came about as his daughter Lucy knew one of the scriptwriters. ""The episode was very funny,"" he added. Little Britain for Comic Relief Prof Hawking with David Walliams and Catherine Tate Prof Hawking had the mother of all wheelchair adaptations when it allowed him to become a transformer-type machine in a Little Britain sketch for Comic Relief. He's seen being pushed through the grounds of a college at the University of Cambridge by Lou Todd - usually seen with wheelchair user Andy Pipkin. When Prof Hawking gets fed up with Lou's patronising chat (about Peppa Pig, among other things), he says: ""Professor Stephen Hawking bot, transform"". He blasts Catherine Tate (playing an equally patronising nun) with a ray gun before chasing after Lou and turning the gun on him, before leaving the scene with a ""ha ha ha"". The Big Bang Theory Sheldon gets to hand over his paper on the Higgs boson to his idol in The Hawking Excitation - which has also seen Howard working on Prof Hawking's wheelchair when he comes to their university to lecture. When Sheldon meets Prof Hawking, he tells him it's an ""honour and a privilege"" to meet him - to which Prof Hawking replies: ""I know."" He then goes on to tell Sheldon he's made a mistake in one of his calculations, causing Sheldon to faint. ""Great, another fainter,"" he says. In another episode, The Extract Obliteration, he appears making a phone call to Sheldon - having played a game of Words With Friends online with him. He calls Sheldon ""Dr Loser"" instead of Dr Cooper and asks: ""What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck."" Comic Relief originals Allow YouTube content?

""No, not a chance"" he tells Simon Cowell, before slightly swearily telling Gordon Ramsay: ""I don't think anyone would take me (beeped out) seriously if I sounded like that.""

Prof Hawking pre-recorded a clip with Brian Cox for Monty Python's 2014 live reunion shows - in which he's seen running over his fellow physicist as he's explaining the expansion of the universe. ""I think you're being pedantic,"" he tells Prof Cox as he knocks him over (well, or a stunt double does), before launching into a version of Monty Python's The Galaxy Song. Star Trek: The Next Generation Prof Hawking with the characters of Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton In an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, he appeared as a hologram playing cards with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. When Sir Isaac pompously started to explain how he discovered gravity, Hawking protested: ""Not the apple story again."" Off camera, as he was being shown the USS Enterprise's warp drive, he reportedly quipped: ""I'm working on that."" Futurama In TV animation Futurama, the perennially dim Phillip J Fry asked Prof Hawking: ""Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?''. The scientist, playing himself, replied: ""Sure. Why not?"" He appeared in a total of three episodes of the animated series. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists in the world, but what about his discoveries? His fame among researchers was founded on a series of studies that wed Albert Einstein's great theory of gravity, general relativity, with the strange world of quantum mechanics, normally applied to tiny things like atoms and molecules. What Hawking ended up with were descriptions of black holes that could boil themselves out of existence, and equations that described the entire history of the Universe in a single sweep. With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These tiny black holes would have been incredibly hot, shedding mass until they vanished - potentially ending their lives in a powerful explosion. In the 70s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light entering a black hole were destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved. With the physicist James Hartle, he tried to describe the history of the cosmos in one mathematical expression. But quantum theory shows that the distinctions between space and time are unclear. As a result, the proposal showed there was little point asking what happened before the Big Bang. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates Hawkingâs first forays into science publication were as a student in the 1960s when heâd had only the first intimations of the motor neurone disease that would become such a big part of his life. With Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - in physicist-speak, a âsingularityâ. At the time, when the still cooling afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation) had only just been detected on the sky, other cosmologists had hoped for something less radical than the notion of an entire Universe emerging out of nothing. Together, Hawking and Penrose showed the quest for gentler answers was hopeless. Hawkingâs next venture, in the 1970s, was to show that black holes are not black at all, but are in fact, as the title of one paper put it, âwhite hotâ. Black holes are the ultimate monster of general relativity. First conceived and named by John Wheeler, they are regions of space so dense that everything within their realm collapses to a single point â another example of a singularity. At the time, it seemed ridiculous that these gorgons of gravity should have anything to do with the delicate theory of quantum mechanics, designed to explain light and the orbits of electrons in atoms. With Roger Penrose, Hawking showed that the Big Bang must have started from an infinitely small point But Hawking showed otherwise. In fact, quantum theory completely changes the fate of black holes. At their very fringes, Hawking demonstrated, black holes would create and radiate new particles due to these laws, losing energy, and hence losing mass (remember Einstein's equation E=mcÂ²). It would take a black hole a very long time to evaporate in this way, but in its last moments Hawking said it would expire in a burst of energy equivalent to a million megaton hydrogen bombs. When the Large Hadron Collider was opened in the Swiss/French countryside outside Geneva, there was hope that the particle accelerator might be able to create microscopic black holes and so prove Hawking's ideas. A Nobel Prize would then have been a certainty. But the LHC has seen nothing yet. Having tackled single black holes, Hawking turned his attention to the Universe as a whole - the ultimate, inescapable gravitational container. The laws of quantum science are as applicable here as to a vanishing black hole, especially at the first moment, the Big Bang. While other researchers struggled to depict a brief moment in the life of a molecule using quantum laws, Hawking showed it was possible to encapsulate the entire history of the whole Universe in a single mathematical expression â âThe Wavefunction of the Universeâ, as he called it. Because the expression is self-contained - it starts at a singularity at the beginning of time and is closed by another at the end of time, and if necessary, history can bounce back and forth between these two book ends. There is no need, indeed no point, to ask what happened before the Big Bang. An existing Universe would explain itself on its own terms. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Hawking continued working on the ramifications of this theory to the end of his life. To know that such a mathematical description might exist is one thing; to know which expression is the right one is a far harder job. Stephen Hawkingâs mind was not the all-conquering juggernaut of public myth. Like any scientist, he got it wrong from time to time, and often had to concede defeat in intellectual combat. We sometimes know of this because of his predilection for laying down fanciful bets over debated points â a yearâs subscription to Playboy versus one for Private Eye, in one instance. This happened in 2004, when he conceded to computer scientist John Preskill that black holes were not the ultimate information shredders in the Universe (a consequence he perceived of his black hole theories that would have undermined some of the most fundamental laws of physics). Hawking accepted black holes could store information about their past, encoded somehow at their edges - the so-called event horizon. Many researchers were frustrated by the ease with which Stephen Hawking generated publicity, often overshadowing other talents with equally extraordinary or challenging ideas. His papers were typically at the extremes of mathematical science, a further step along the path heâd chosen to follow in his student days; but they were not always close to the central scientific issues of the day. Nevertheless, his ability to project his intellectual enthusiasm beyond his frail body, and to draw the wider public into abstruse realms of science is undeniable.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our response must be decisive and proportionate and based on clear evidence."" Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman has said there is not yet definitive proof the Russian state was behind the attempted murder of a former spy in Salisbury. He said the most likely explanation was Russia that was ""directly or indirectly responsible"" for the attack but ""culpability takes many forms"". He pointed to the ""problematic history"" of UK intelligence on chemical weapons. It came as several Labour MPs called for their leader to be firmer in his condemnation of Russia. A succession of Labour MPs - including many who are on record opposing Mr Corbyn as Labour leader - backed Theresa May's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats and take other measures in response to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a military grade nerve agent. Russia has denied any involvement in the attack. In his response to the prime minister's Commons statement announcing the measures, Mr Corbyn called for a ""decisive and proportionate response based on clear evidence"". UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats Russia retaliation could hurt UK business McDonnell: Don't boycott the World Cup His former leadership contest rival - and current chairwoman of the Home Affairs committee - Yvette Cooper said what was needed was ""unequivocal"" condemnation of Russia's actions. And former Labour minister Pat McFadden said showing resolve when your country was threatened was an ""essential component of political leadership"" and ""more than words"" was needed as a response. Mr Corbyn's spokesman said Labour did not oppose any of the measures outlined by Mrs May - including the expulsions - but urged caution over reaching a definitive judgement on who was behind the attack. ""Whoever carried out the attack is responsible for a heinous and reckless attack in a civilian area,"" he told reporters after the Commons debate. This video can not be played Theresa May announces the UK is expelling 23 Russian diplomats from London He said the Labour leadership could not disclose the detail of the security briefings it had received on the crisis. But he said the two scenarios put forward by the prime minister on Monday - either direct Russian state involvement or a loss of control by the state of the deadly chemicals - were still both possible and that ""culpability had different forms"". He said there was ""a series of possibilities as to who may be responsible"", including oligarchs, Mafia elements and other ex-Soviet states. In a reference to intelligence failings before the Iraq War, he added: ""There is a history between weapons of mass destruction and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly,"" Asked if Mr Corbyn, who opposed the then Labour government's backing for the Iraq War, was worried about being out of step with his party, the spokesman said Mr Corbyn had been ""right about a lot of things"" in the past two decades and the reaction of other MPs ""isn't always backed by the facts"". Speaking in the Commons, Mr Corbyn had condemned the ""appalling"" attack but did not directly apportion blame to Russia. He pressed Theresa May on whether the UK had supplied traces of the nerve agent used in the attack to Russia for analysis before Wednesday's deadline, as the Kremlin had asked. And he asked what action the UK was taking with its allies through the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons. The UK's response, said the Labour leader, should be underpinned by support for the rule of law and international agreements and respect for human rights. Allow Twitter content?

But Labour MP John Woodcock - a long-term critic of Mr Corbyn - said it was vital for the Commons to ""speak as one"" on the issue and show its resolve in the face of Russian aggression. He told the PM she will be ""reassured to hear that a clear majority of Labour MPs, alongside the leader of every other party, support, the firm stance she is taking"". His colleague Ben Bradshaw said ""most of us on these benches fully support the measures she has announced and, indeed, some of us think they could have come a bit sooner."" Sixteen Labour MPs have signed a Commons motion ""unequivocally accepting"" the Russian state's culpability for the attack and supporting the UK government's response.

"The UK is seeking support in the UN Security Council but knows Russia can sabotage the process There are no easy political choices for the prime minister. She has taken significant steps to try to punish Russia for the poisoning attack in Salisbury with the biggest diplomatic moves against Russia since the end of the Cold War. But the government is all too aware that there is likely to be retaliation from Moscow, alongside ongoing denials and scorn in the coming days. By implication then, the government is well aware that they will have to make more moves in the coming days, or risk looking as if they have backed down after one opening blast. But ministers also know that bigger and bolder moves can't be taken without support from international friends and allies. UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt But as soon as other countries' interests come into play, so too do competing demands for them. At the UN, Russia itself, of course, can sabotage the process. In the EU other countries, even Britain's friends, have other considerations to take - closer business ties, a reliance on Russian gas. No 10 has put significant effort into trying to shore up friendly signals from allies, but words of support may not translate into a commitment to any firm actions. Ministers obviously felt they had little choice but to take firm action today but in the longer term, it is clearly not diplomatically desirable for Britain to have plunged its relations with Russia into the deep freeze if friendly countries aren't willing to try to help in meaningful ways. The prime minister's undoubtedly tricky position is however shored up by noisy support from her backbenches, a unity that she is unaccustomed to. The roles have perhaps been reversed. Because in the last couple of days Labour has looked like two parties again, with the Tories cheering their rival backbenchers opposite when they rise to support the government's position in the Commons -  while Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team stayed silent at times, arms crossed, faces glum. And at least one senior frontbencher in the Labour Party is considering leaving his post tonight, and Labour MPs are circulating a motion that explicitly backs Theresa May's position, not the Labour leader's. The uneasy truce in Labour that's held since the general election has cracked wide open again. To his supporters, one of Jeremy Corbyn's fundamental appeals is that he doesn't believe in going along with the government on foreign policy. Simply, he is not ready yet to point the finger at the Russian state. But for others in Labour this is unacceptable, and by betraying the tradition that the main two parties stick together in this kind of situation, at least publicly, he is also betraying some of Labour's own traditions. Forget Brexit for now, this challenge to our relations with the rest of the world could become a defining feature of our politics for both sides at home.

"This video can not be played Toys R Us administrator explains why the company was too difficult to sell All Toys R Us stores in the UK will close in the next six weeks following the chain's collapse into administration. Attempts to find a buyer for the US retailer's 100 stores in the UK have failed. Twenty five stores have either closed in recent days or are due to shut by Thursday. The collapse will put more than 3,000 people out of work as a dismal period for the retail sector continues. Administrators Moorfields Advisory were appointed last monthto start winding down the UK's biggest toy retailer after it struggled to pay a Â£15m tax bill. Simon Thomas, joint administrator, said Moorfields' had negotiated with 120 different parties, most of them interested in buying up stock, and half a dozen looking at the whole business. But in the end Mr Thomas said the business had simply proved too hard to sell. He told the BBC: ""Any potential purchaser would have difficulty in sorting things out, for instance getting the rights to use the name, which is held by the American parent. ""In addition there are many services provided within the group by different subsidiaries, so if you take over one part you have to make alternative arrangements or negotiate new terms. Put all that together and becomes very complicated."" Mr Thomas said remaining stock would be discounted further and ""it should be an opportunity for people to buy some nice toys at a good price."" The administrators said that Toys R Us had outstanding liabilities of around Â£300m, including a Â£70-90m pension fund shortfall. The US parent company filed for bankruptcy in September and reports suggest it may start closing its 800 stores in the US as early as this week. The business was bought in 2005 by a group of investors including private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR, which loaded it with some $5bn (Â£3.6bn) in debt.  The company was crippled by interest payments which at times reached $400m a year. In the UK Toys R Us joins a long list of high street retailers including Maplin and Claire's that have run into difficulties this year. Many have been hit by changes in consumer spending habits, a squeeze on disposable income, higher inflation and the national living wage, and the prospect next month of increases in business rates.

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars Rapist John Worboys is ""entitled to be released"" from prison, his lawyer has told judges at a High Court challenge to stop his parole. Police believe Worboys, jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women, was responsible for more than 100 attacks. Two victims have challenged the board's decision to free the 60-year-old, who watched proceedings via video link. Edward Fitzgerald QC said Worboys was entitled to release because the board had ""directed"" it. He added that rather than taking the ""drastic and unprecedented step"" of taking away Worboys' freedom, conditions for release could be strengthened. ""He has completed his tariff and he is therefore entitled to be released if it is not necessary for the protection of the public that he be detained,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. ""I think it is a unique case in which someone who has been granted his freedom has then had it taken away from him."" Representing the Parole Board, Ben Collins QC said it was ""important"" to acknowledge the victims' courage. ""We are acutely conscious that underlying this forensic and analytical debate are stories of real and serious suffering on the part of the victims,"" said Mr Collins. On Tuesday, a lawyer representing two of Worboys' victims said the board had failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against him before approving his release from prison. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The former black cab driver, who has changed his name to John Radford, denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. She added that the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. However, Worboys' lawyer on Wednesday argued it was ""wrong"" to use the Parole Board to asses the validity of those claims. Lord Justice Leveson has told the court the ruling will be reserved and handed down at a later date. In the meantime, Worboys will remain in prison. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges have heard evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend.

"Stephen Hawking was both one of the world's most famous scientists and most famous disabled people. His life was a juxtaposition of sparkling intellect and failing body. Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease when he was 22. The nerves that controlled his muscles were failing and he became trapped in his body, but his mind was still free. He reached the height of his field while being a wheelchair user and communicating through a synthetic voice. So did he change society's perceptions of disability? Allow Twitter content?

""I think he's done more than anyone else,"" said Prof Paul Shellard, who was a student of Prof Hawking. He told the BBC: ""He's been an incredible exemplar of there being no boundary to human endeavour. ""He identified what he could do well, exceptionally well, and focussed on that, not what he couldn't do."" That made him a role-model and inspiration for many. Prof Hawking certainly raised awareness of motor neurone diseases. One of his major contributions to disability in general was simply being visible - often at a time when disabled voices were missing from popular culture. He made small-screen appearances on The Simpsons, Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory. His life was dramatised by the BBC and in the film The Theory of Everything. Steve Bell, from the MND association, said: ""He was probably the most famous person with a physical disability and it almost normalises it to see his absolute genius. ""I think it affected a lot of people, seeing he's more than a trapped body. ""The public's view of disability has changed."" But Prof Hawking's life was exceptional. He lived five decades longer than doctors expected. Many others with motor neurone disease die in the years after diagnosis. He was a theoretical physicist. His laboratory was in the mind, his scientific equipment was mathematics. Prof Hawking was able to continue to pursue his career in a way that would have been much harder in other scientific disciplines and impossible in many other professions. It remains an open question how much he would have achieved if he was disabled from birth rather than after graduating with a first at Oxford. Today, disabled people aremore than twice as likely,externalto be unemployed than people without disability. Prof Hawking's only advice on disability was to focus on what could be achieved. ""My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit, as well as physically,"" he said in an interviewwith the New York Times,external.

"Jim Bowen with Bullseye mascot Bully Broadcaster and comedian Jim Bowen, best known for hosting darts-based game show Bullseye in the 1980s and '90s, has died at the age of 80. His wife Phyllis confirmed the news to BBC Radio Lancashire. The former deputy headmaster, who lived in North Lancashire, began his career as a stand-up comedian on the club circuit in the 1960s. He became a household name when he began presenting Bullseye in 1981. The Sunday tea time show ran for 14 years. It attracted 17.5 million viewers at its peak and involved three pairs of contestants - with a ""thrower"", who would throw the darts, and a ""knower"", who would answer general knowledge questions. Bullseye's prizes included cars and speedboats Bowen became known for catchphrases including ""Super, smashing, great"", ""You can't beat a bit of Bully!"" and ""Let's look at what you could have won"". Another favourite phrase - ""keep out of the black and in to the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed"" - referred to the segments of the darts board that the players had to hit. His warm-hearted and quick-witted rapport with the contestants was a big part of the show's appeal. Bowen became Bullseye host after appearing on ITV show The Comedians, alongside the likes of Frank Carson, Russ Abbott and Bernard Manning. He also had a number of TV acting roles, including in Muck and Brass, Jonathan Creek, The Grimleys, and as Hoss Cartwright in the second series of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights. Allow Twitter content?

"Ahmed Hassan was motivated by hatred of the UK, the Old Bailey heard The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing was moved by ""anger and hatred"" when he planted the explosives, the Old Bailey has heard. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said Ahmed Hassan blamed the UK for his father's death in Iraq and he ""left nothing to chance"" in the attack's planning. His actions were ""designed to cause death and destruction"", she said. Mr Hassan, 18, denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life on 15 September 2017. He told his mentor college lecturer Kayte Cable that it was his ""duty to hate Britain"", the court heard. He had also told the Home Office he had been ""trained to kill"" by the so-called Islamic State group, when he claimed asylum in 2016. In his evidence on Wednesday, he said that was a lie and he only wanted to cause a fire and not an explosion by planting the device on the Tube train. In her closing speech, Ms Morgan said: ""He (Mr Hassan) may have been troubled by events in his past. He may well be motivated by circumstances he may now not admit to you. ""What he did that day was an act of anger and hatred designed to cause death and destruction of property."" She continued: ""It is a matter of luck that there was not a full explosion that day, not because of any deliberate intention on the part of the defendant to cause just a fire."" This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Ms Morgan replayed CCTV footage of the fireball passing through the carriage, saying passengers had been ""terrified"", with some suffering serious injury. She asked jurors to imagine what would have happened if 400g of TATP explosives had fully exploded, sending 2.2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts flying at high velocity. ""Whatever story he tells you in the witness box, the fact that he was angry with this country was clear to those who met him, especially Ms Cable... he described it as his duty or right to hate this country and he blamed this country for the death of his father,"" she said. She said Mr Hassan had lied in his evidence, when he said it was all part of a fantasy and an act of boredom. Ms Morgan said: ""He may well have lied to all those people for two years but he may well also be lying to you. ""Lying to you about the truth of his past with Islamic State for the obvious reason that if he was trained to kill by IS that would tell you something about his mindset and who he really is and where he has really come from. ""You can be sure it was not an act of attention-seeking or boredom. This was someone who wanted to cause death and damage and make good his escape."" She said Mr Hassan was ""calculated and clever"" in his preparations and when he looked up the news on the BBC website afterwards, he was not reassured that it was a minor incident, as he claimed. It was how he found out that he had ""failed"" in his intention, she said. Defending, Tim Moloney QC told jurors that those who knew Mr Hassan saw a ""sincere, positive boy"". He said Barnardo's staff said he was a ""very polite"" young person ""seeking help, looking forward to the future"". Mr Moloney said Mr Hassan had gone from being a ""troubled young man"" to doing well at college. He said: ""It seems to me the prosecution suggest there may be truth that maybe he was with IS and it's possible we may never know. ""That's not good enough for me. We say that if he was with Isis (Islamic State), would he have said that and raised that potential with the Home Office and draw attention to himself in that way? ""If he was with Isis he would have had many opportunities to do what he wanted. Making TATP is a really straightforward process that can be done in a day."" The trial continues.

"The diocese of Chichester is being investigated by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse The diocese of Chichester had a ""major issue"" with priests carrying out abuse, an inquiry has heard. Bishop of Chichester, the Rt Rev Martin Warner, made the claim when giving evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. Dr Warner said there had been a ""breakdown of trust"" between the Church of England and the local council. He also said he was warned by a senior Church of England official that the area was considered ""a basket case"". The bishop claimed Caroline Boddington, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury's appointments secretary, made the remark when he was appointed in 2012. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Dr Warner said there was a ""damaged relationship"" between two bishops in office at the time - his predecessor John Hind and a junior bishop in the diocese Wallace Benn. Both have been accused of not responding properly to reports of abuse. Dr Warner claimed officials at East Sussex County Council had urged the Archbishop of Canterbury to sack Bishop Benn - the Bishop of Lewes - and that he had held talks with colleagues about a ""dignified exit"" for the bishop soon after he moved to the diocese. There were also issues with parishioners, with Dr Warner describing a ""hostile"" response over the church's treatment of Bishop Peter Ball - who was convicted of abusing children. ""I was kind of persona non grata with them because they believed the church had mistreated him and was continuing to mistreat him badly, and that was a shock to me,"" he said. The bishop said there was an atmosphere of ""defensiveness and pride"" at the diocese's headquarters in Hove, along with a fear of the media. ""It wasn't clear who was going to say what to them when they were asking legitimate and pressing questions and nobody knew quite where the answer was due to come from,"" said Dr Warner. ""There was a fear of making an answer which would be taken, particularly by Bishop Wallace Benn, to be a slur on his character."" He added: ""Pride and arrogance sometimes stems from a genuine commitment to the church, and there are aspects of that which are positive. But it can also bind us to its real failings."" But he rejected calls by some survivors that it should be an offence not to report a disclosure of sexual abuse. Dr Warner said: ""I'm not sure that mandatory reporting is necessarily the way that we are going to achieve best protection for children."" Ending his evidence, he repeated his apology to survivors, saying he ""grieved for the loss of access to faith that this has often resulted in"". The inquiry continues.

"Annual tax rises of Â£40bn will be needed if the government wants to keep spending constant and balance its books by 2025, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies added that dismal productivity, earnings and GDP growth had become the ""new normal"". Its forecast comes after the chancellor unveiled upgraded growth and borrowing forecastsin the Spring Statement on Tuesday. Philip Hammond said the UK economy had reached a turning point. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said that""nothing much"" had changed,externalin the Spring Statement. He said the UK was still suffering the hangover of the 2008 financial crisis and its growth outlook was ""the worst in the G20"". He said the big problem facing the chancellor was how to balance growing demands for spending increases with his promise to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s. On the one hand, public services such as prisons and the NHS were struggling ""in a way that they were not two or three years ago"", Mr Johnson said. On the other, the government is struggling to collect as much tax as it used to, after taking large numbers of people out of paying income tax. ""The chancellor has been unable to tackle the problems posed by the increasing numbers of self-employed and company owner managers, who pay less tax than similarly remunerated employees,"" Mr Johnson added. ""If high-paid jobs - and EU citizens, who are well represented among high earners in the UK - relocate elsewhere, the consequences for the Exchequer will be severe,"" he added. Given the outlook, the IFS said tax rises of Â£30bn would be needed each year to retain public spending and balance the budget by the middle of the next decade - a Conservative Party pledge. An extra Â£11bn would be required to cover social care, health and pension costs for the ageing population, the IFS said. In the Spring Statement, Mr Hammond said growth was now forecast to be 1.5% in 2018, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November. He also said debt was expected to fall as a share of GDP from 2018-19, the first drop in 17 years, and that inflation would return to 2% by the end of the year. Growth is now forecast to be 1.5% in 2018, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November However, Mr Johnson said the good news on borrowing would ""largely wash out"" over the next few years, while the structural deficit in 2019-20 would be almost unchanged. He added that the UK economy was now 14% smaller than would have been expected, based on pre-crisis trends, while median earnings remained below their 2008 level. ""The reality of the economic and fiscal challenges facing us ought to be at the very top of the news agenda,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And I mean the reality, not the spin and bluster of politicians on all sides pretending there are easy solutions."" Commenting on the IFS's analysis, John McDonnell MP, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""Despite the chancellor's spin yesterday, the IFS has revealed that there may be Â£30bn of new tax rises and spending cuts to come. ""Under the Tories, it won't be the richest who are hit by these tax rises and austerity cuts, but the poorest - largely families and children - who will bear the brunt of their heartless economic plans."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our balanced approach has reduced the deficit while also cutting taxes for over 30 million people and investing in our vital public services.""

"A strict macrobiotic diet tends to rely heavily on whole grains such as brown rice Police in Italy say they have broken up a ""psycho sect"" that enslaved members by forcing them to adhere to a strict macrobiotic diet and cut off contact with the outside world. Five people are under investigation over allegations including maltreatment and tax evasion. Among the suspects is a business mogul who is accused of manipulating followers of the diet he created. Mario Pianesi reportedly told them that Ma.Pi. would provide miracle cures. The investigation started in 2013 after a young woman left the sect and denounced its head to police. They found that as well as having to pay for the diet and give donations, members were coerced into working long hours with next to no pay. The housemaid's tale: I ate dog food to survive Brazil sect 'kept followers as slaves' Cult leader guilty of sex assaults What does modern slavery look like? Mr Pianesi, a well-known macrobiotics entrepreneur in Italy, is said to have given long speeches espousing the doctrine of his diet and brainwashing followers. The weight of one woman dropped to 35kg (77lb) as a result of adhering to his rigid regime, local media report. Investigators said sect leaders specifically manipulated people with mental health problems, persuading them to turn away from traditional medicine. The allegations include criminal organisation with the aim of reducing people to slavery. The accused have not responded publicly.

"This video can not be played Thousands of students protest for gun reform Students and school staff across the US are commemorating the Florida school shooting with a walkout, exactly one month after the killings. They are stopping lessons for 17 minutes in memory of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Pupils at the school, which was targeted by a former student, hugged each other on the football field. Protest organisers accuse Congress of failing to tackle gun violence. The White Houserevealed a plan this week to deter school shootingswhich does not include President Donald Trump's repeated calls to raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles to 21. Instead, it moves ahead with his controversial proposal to provide firearms training to school employees. A student fastens a pin to her friend during a rally in Brooklyn, NY Students gathered outside the White House as part of the nationwide protest The walkouts included moments of silence to remember the shooting victims Tales of heroism from Florida attack Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The walkouts began at 10:00 in the eastern US (14:00 GMT) and moved west across America's time zones. Organisers of the National School Walkout, who were also behind the Women's March in January 2017 against Mr Trump's inauguration, called on ""students, teachers, school administrators, parents and allies"" to take part. On their website,,externalthey accuse Congress of ""inaction to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing"" schools and neighbourhoods. Schools taking part included Colorado's Columbine High School where 13 people were shot dead by two students in 1999. ""I should be writing my college essay, not my will"" a student's sign in New York says Students in the Washington DC area marched to Congress and the White House Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School walked to the football field In Parkland, families and supporters applauded as thousands of students slowly marched on to the Stoneman Douglas school football field. School principal Ty Thompson called on them to stage the ""biggest group hug"". A large crowd of students from the Washington DC area gathered outside the White House holding signs reading ""Protect People Not Guns"" and chanting ""Never again"" and ""Enough is enough"". Some students also gathered at Capitol Hill where they were addressed by the Senate and House Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. ""We're all moved by your eloquence and your fearless insistence on action to prevent gun violence,"" Ms Pelosi told them. ""Thank you for bringing your urgency to this fight, to the doorstep of America, the doorstep of the Capitol of the United States."" Students in suburban Chicago honoured members of their own community who have been killed with guns Students in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, stood in a heart formation to pay tribute to the Parkland victims. In New York, hundreds of students from Fiorello H LaGuardia High School - many dressed in orange, the colour of the gun-control movement - took to the streets of Manhattan. ""Thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" read one sign. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also joined protesters for a symbolic ""die-in"" - lying down in a street in Lower Manhattan.

The disruption to the school day is opposed by some schools, notably in one Texas district where students who walk out have been told they face a three-day suspension. ""We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved,"" said Needville schools superintendent Curtis Rhode. In New Jersey, student Rosa Rodriquez has reportedly received a suspension after disobeying the school's order to remain in the auditorium to mark the walkout. A North Carolina student - who was apparently the only one of his classmates to leave - tweeted a video of himself outside his school which has now received thousands of shares.

The former pupil arrived on campus and began shooting students and staff before abandoning the weapon and escaping, according to court documents. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' Fourteen students and three members of staff died. US prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the attacker who has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened The US House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 407-10 in support of a bill to authorise $50m (Â£36m) in federal grants for training, anonymous reporting systems, threat assessments, intervention teams and school and police coordination. It does not address gun control. It is unclear when the Senate, which is expected to take up a separate measure to strengthen background checks for gun buyers, will consider the bill. US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi addressed students outside the US Capitol The House measure would not allow the approved funding to be used to arm teachers or school personnel, a provision the White House has backed. President Trump tweeted his support of the bill on Wednesday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Toys R Us administrator explains why the company was too difficult to sell All Toys R Us stores in the UK will close in the next six weeks following the chain's collapse into administration. Attempts to find a buyer for the US retailer's 100 stores in the UK have failed. Twenty five stores have either closed in recent days or are due to shut by Thursday. The collapse will put more than 3,000 people out of work as a dismal period for the retail sector continues. Administrators Moorfields Advisory were appointed last monthto start winding down the UK's biggest toy retailer after it struggled to pay a Â£15m tax bill. Simon Thomas, joint administrator, said Moorfields' had negotiated with 120 different parties, most of them interested in buying up stock, and half a dozen looking at the whole business. But in the end Mr Thomas said the business had simply proved too hard to sell. He told the BBC: ""Any potential purchaser would have difficulty in sorting things out, for instance getting the rights to use the name, which is held by the American parent. ""In addition there are many services provided within the group by different subsidiaries, so if you take over one part you have to make alternative arrangements or negotiate new terms. Put all that together and becomes very complicated."" Mr Thomas said remaining stock would be discounted further and ""it should be an opportunity for people to buy some nice toys at a good price."" The administrators said that Toys R Us had outstanding liabilities of around Â£300m, including a Â£70-90m pension fund shortfall. The US parent company filed for bankruptcy in September and reports suggest it may start closing its 800 stores in the US as early as this week. The business was bought in 2005 by a group of investors including private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR, which loaded it with some $5bn (Â£3.6bn) in debt.  The company was crippled by interest payments which at times reached $400m a year. In the UK Toys R Us joins a long list of high street retailers including Maplin and Claire's that have run into difficulties this year. Many have been hit by changes in consumer spending habits, a squeeze on disposable income, higher inflation and the national living wage, and the prospect next month of increases in business rates.

""One of the elements was whether the denominational mix of coins meets the public need. From the early reaction it looks as if it does."" Eight uses for your 1p and 2p coins Many countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada and Sweden have ditched their low denomination coins. The Treasury consultation document pointed out that 1p and 2p coins are scarcely used. It says that surveys suggest six in 10 of UK 1p and 2p coins are only used once before being put in a jar or discarded, while one in 12 is thrown into a bin. Is this the end for 1p and 2p coins?

"This video can not be played Conor Lamb: 'Mission accepted' A Democrat has declared victory after a cliffhanger Pennsylvania election for a congressional district that Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016. There is no official result, but Conor Lamb and Republican opponent Rick Saccone were neck-and-neck in the solidly conservative 18th district. Republican sway over the constituency is so strong that Democrats fielded no candidates in the last two votes. The contest could set the tone for November's US mid-term polls. This video can not be played This is why US gun laws probably won't change Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called the race a ""wakeup call"" for his party. With votes counted in every precinct of the working-class district, Mr Lamb was on 49.8% while Mr Saccone had 49.6%. A terrible night for Trump in Pennsylvania The Democrat was ahead by more than 600 ballots out of nearly 230,000 cast amid a nail-biting tally of absentee votes. The 33-year-old claimed victory late on Tuesday saying: ""It took a little longer than we thought but we did it. You did it."" Mr Saccone has not conceded the race. Mr Lamb is a 33-year-old socially-conservative Democrat and former federal prosecutor The outcome could shape the contours of the mid-term elections, when Republicans will fight to keep their majority in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats need 24 seats to win back control of the House, which would be the first time they would control the chamber since 2010. President Trump visited the 18th district in western Pennsylvania twice during the campaign, and Republicans spent millions of dollars to keep a hold of the seat. Despite holding a rally in the district on Saturday, the president told those around him that he viewed Mr Saccone as a ""weak"" candidate, Axios reported. The vice-president, the president's eldest son and daughter also visited the state to campaign for Mr Saccone. Mr Trump has privately criticised the candidate as ""weak"" Marine veteran Conor Lamb, a former prosecutor, has promised not to support Democratic House of Representatives leader Nancy Pelosi and has taken up moderate positions. He has said he opposes new gun restrictions, but backs expanded background checks, and declared himself opposed to abortion. Mr Lamb managed to out-fundraise his competitor by nearly 500%, and drew the support of blue-collar workers that Republicans had hoped to court with Mr Trump's new tariffs and tax cuts. Mr Saccone, 60, is a four-term state lawmaker, Air Force veteran and former counter-intelligence officer who has referred to himself as Mr Trump's ""wingman"". He was criticised late in the campaign after he said some of his opponents ""have a hatred for God"". Mr Saccone also called himself ""Trump before Trump was Trump"". The two competed to replace Tim Murphy, who resigned last October after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher If the 2018 congressional mid-terms are a coming electoral tsunami in favour of the Democrats, Tuesday's Pennsylvania special election was the ocean water receding beyond the horizon. The wave is out there, and it may only be a matter of time before it comes crashing down on the Republican Party. The results in Pennsylvania are razor thin and could still tilt either way. Given the nature of the district, however, it shouldn't have been close. Republicans drew the boundaries in 2011 to give themselves a safe seat. In two recent elections, Democrats didn't even field a congressional candidate. In 2016, Donald Trump carried the district by 20 points. Now, the political pendulum is swinging toward the Democrats in a very big way. White working-class voters, who rallied to Mr Trump, either didn't vote or opted for the Democrat. There's still time for Republicans to respond, of course. And the mid-term electorate may be different than the one that shows up for a special election in March. If seats that look like this Pennsylvania district are toss-ups in November, however, a lot of Republican candidates are going to get swept away. Celebrations will be short-lived, as the winner must begin campaigning for a seat in a different district. Due to new district boundaries imposed by the state Supreme Court in January, the 18th district will be split up into four different constituencies in November's poll. The new boundaries mean the district will not exist in its current form in November. The winner will serve out the rest of the year and then have to begin campaigning in one of the newly drawn districts. The deadline to file to run in November is 20 March.

"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack on a former spy and his daughter who were poisoned on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. ""There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable,"" Mrs May told Parliament, calling it ""an unlawful use of force"". Russia has denied involvement in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, on 4 March. The 23 diplomats identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"" were given one week to leave, in the largest mass expulsion in the UK in more than 30 years. The Russian embassy said the decision was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". Other measures included: Increased checks on private flights, customs and freight The freezing of Russian state assets where there is evidence they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents Ministers and Royal Family members to boycott the World Cup in Russia later this year The suspension of all planned high level bilateral contacts between the UK and Russia Plans to consider new laws to increase defences against ""hostile state activity"". This could come through a British version of the 2012 US Magnitsky act, which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations with asset freezes and travel bans. MPs have pushed for a Magnitsky amendment to be added to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill going through Parliament Take some sort of action to bar wealthy Russian oligarchs from accessing their mansions and other luxuries in London, as suggested by Tory MP and House of Commons foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat. One way this could happen is through the use of Unexplained Wealth Orders, which allow government officials to seize assets including property until they have been properly accounted for Taking Russian broadcasters such as RT (formerly Russia Today) off the air.

Current sanctions on Russia that Britain supports,externalare imposed via the European Union, and target Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors. They were first passed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and backed rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine, and include: The exclusion of state banks from raising long-term loans in the EU A ban on exports of dual-use equipment that could be put to military use and a ban on EU-Russia arms deals A ban on exports of a wide range of oil industry technology Asset freezes and travel bans on 150 people and 38 companies This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning EU countries are already divided on the sanctions and some doubt whether Britain could convince the bloc to further toughen its measures, especially as it prepares to leave the union. The bloc will discuss the issue in a meeting next week, European Council President Donald Tusk said, calling it a ""brutal attack inspired most likely by Moscow"". More on EU sanctions Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth By framing the poisoning as a possible ""unlawful use of force"" by Russia, Theresa May prompted questions as to whether this could be a matter for Nato, the military alliance of 29 countries. The alliance's policy of collective defence - under Article 5 - states that an attack on any one ally is seen as an attack on all. It was invoked for the first and only time by the United States after the 9/11 attacks. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" But Downing Street has played down suggestions that this is an Article 5 matter. For its part, Nato urged Russia to answer the UK's questions, expressing ""deep concern"" over the ""first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory"" since its foundation. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery What are Novichok nerve agents? The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting at the UK's request,where British deputy ambassador Jonathan Allen said Russia had used ""a weapon so horrific that it is banned in war"". At the meeting US Ambassador Nikki Haley said: ""The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable."" And US President Donald Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has accused Russia of undermining the security of countries worldwide. Mrs May has had phone discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron, and a statement from the country's embassy said ""there is no other plausible explanation"" than Russian involvement. It added France expressed ""solidarity regarding its ally"".

"Exchanges offering trade in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other crypto-currencies will be affected Google has moved to ban crypto-currency advertising from its platforms. The move will affect promotional campaigns for initial coin offerings, Bitcoin exchanges, digital wallets to store the assets and trading advice. A notice said the policywould be introduced in June,externalbut did not give an explanation why. The BBC understands that Google decided to act because it felt there was a lack of appropriate consumer protections for highly speculative and complex trades. It follows a similarmove by Facebookin January, which said many firms in the sectorwere acting in bad faith,external. Google's decision will affect ads displayed both in its search results and YouTube, as well as those placed on third-party sites via its ad platforms. The value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all dipped after the news emerged at about 04:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement,some users of Google's AdWords service,externalhad reported a drop-off in the performance of their crypto-currency campaigns, although the tech giant denied having made any policy changes at that point. Google has also said it will tighten its rules for ads relating to other financial products including spread betting and contracts-for-difference - in which sellers promise to provide compensation for an asset's gain in value over a set period of time, and buyers to cover a loss. It said AdWords users would have to be licensed by the  relevant regulators in the countries they are targeting and be certified by Google itself. ""This is all a good move,"" commented crypto-currency sceptic David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""It's about tackling the kinds of risky investments that verge on gambling. ""If you're a proper trader or an accredited investor then fine - it means you're rich and your money is your own problem. But these things shouldn't be targeted at ordinary people."" Google's move followed a warning about crypto-currencies published by theInternational Monetary Fund's managing director on Tuesday,external. The IMF's Christine Lagarde has also warned of the risks of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets ""Money laundering and terrorist financing is only one dimension of the threat,"" wrote Christine Lagarde. ""The rapid growth of crypto-assets, the extreme volatility in their traded prices, and their ill-defined connections to the traditional financial world could easily create new vulnerabilities. ""We must welcome their potential but also recognise their risks.""

"Tom Bradby is the main host of ITV's evening news ITN, which makes news programmes for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, pays men an average of 18.2% more than women. That is lower than the national median average pay gap of 18.4%. When it comes to bonus payments, ITN's gap is 50%. The company said 17 of its 20 top earners are men. ITN CEO John Hardie said the gap was ""mainly caused by having fewer women than men in senior leadership roles and we know that we have to work even harder to address this"". Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newmansaid the figures showed,external""just how pervasive inequality is"". The company announced a series of measures to improve the picture, including reducing the overall pay gap by 50% over the next five years. It also said it would make sure half of the 20 top earners' roles would be occupied by women within five years. The Guardian also released figures on Wednesday, showing its median pay difference is 12.1% - with a figure of 9% for editorial staff and 18.2% for non-editorial. In a statement, editor-in-chief Katharine Viner and David Pemsel said while the gap was lower than the national average, it was ""not good enough"" and they aim to reduce it further. ""The gap is driven by two main factors: there are more men in the highest-paid and most senior roles; and there are more women in lower-paid administration, sales and marketing roles,"" they said. ""While this is the case at many organisations and reflects society more broadly, it does not make it acceptable."" Guardian News and Media said it wants to achieve 50:50 equal pay in the top half of the company within the next five years. ""This is an ambitious goal but one we will strive to achieve,"" said Viner and Pemsel. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Five things you may not have known about Prof Hawking World renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76. He died peacefully at his home in Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday, his family said. The British scientist was famed for his work with black holes and relativity, and wrote several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. At the age of 22Prof Hawkingwas given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. In a statement his children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: ""We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. ""He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years."" They praised his ""courage and persistence"" and said his ""brilliance and humour"" inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever."" A book of condolence has been opened at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge, where Prof Hawking was a fellow. This video can not be played Professor Brian Cox on the legacy and wonder of Hawking's work Prof Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics. He also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking China's love for the late Stephen Hawking A brief history of Stephen Hawking's cameos Through his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated thatEinstein's general theory of relativityimplies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. The scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory. Allow Twitter content?

The comedian and presenter of the BBC's Stargazing Live Dara O'Briain said the scientist had an ""immeasurable life"" and ""one of the few people I would call a hero of mine"". Theoretical physicist, professor Jim Al-Khalili, from Surrey University said Prof Hawking had a tremendous sense of humour. He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""He was a fun loving guy. Inside that shell, inside that body that was paralysed, was someone who was full of vigour, full of passion for life."" With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy In the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved British astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". Gian Giudice, head of theoretical physics at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, said Prof Hawking had a ""great impact"" on the centre's research, adding: ""A giant of our field has left us, but his immortal contributions will remain forever.""

"I was lucky enough to meet Prof Stephen Hawking several times. Each time it was a joy. There was a marvellous twinkle in his eye and always a mischievous sense of humour. It was these qualities and his determination not to allow his disability to prevent him from contributing to research that made him so famous and indeed so loved by people all across the world. I first went to interview Prof Hawking in 2004 at his office in Cambridge. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates I felt a mixture of awe and excitement as I waited for the man who for years had been my idol. He seemed to smile at me as he entered the room which immediately put me at my ease. The camera operator I was with wanted to make a last minute adjustment to his lighting and so he asked Prof Hawking's staff if he could pull out one of the plugs in the office so that he could use the socket for his equipment. Without waiting for a response he pulled the plug and the room was filled with a deafening siren. Prof Hawking then slouched forward and I feared that my colleague had inadvertently unplugged a vital piece of life-support equipment. Fortunately, it was the alarm to the uninterruptable power supply to his office computer and he was slouched forward with mirth at our incompetence. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Thankfully, he invited me to interview him many times after that. We talked a lot about his science of course. But what I remember most was his humanity. As well as his own work he would often talk about the social implications of research and the responsibility scientists had to make sure that their work was used for  the benefit of society. And it was for this that he became the world's most famous scientist. He reached people not normally interested in science because of his compassion as well as his genius. And that wicked sense of humour. When I asked him how we could test his belief that radiation emerged from black holes, he told me that he did not wish to get too close to a black hole for fear of falling in - but he did agree that it would be a wonderful way to go.

"Stephen Hawking was the most remarkable author I had the privilege of working with during my career as the director of science publishing at Cambridge University Press. In 1982, I had responsibility for his third academic book for the Press, Superspace And Supergravity. This was a messy collection of papers from a technical workshop on how to devise a new theory of gravity. While that book was in production, I suggested he try something easier: a popular book about the nature of the Universe, suitable for the general market. Stephen mulled over my suggestion. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates He already had an international reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist working on rotating black holes and theories of gravity. And he had concerns about financial matters: importantly, it was impossible for him to obtain any form of life insurance to protect his family in the event of his death or becoming total dependent on nursing care. So, he took precious time out from his research to prepare the rough draft of a book. Ten million copies in all editions and translations At the time, several bestselling physics authors had already published non-technical books on the early Universe and black holes. Stephen decided to write a more personal approach, by explaining his own research in cosmology and quantum theory. As he himself pointed out it, his area of interest had ""become so technical that only a very small number of specialists could master the mathematics"" used to describe it. For a starting point, he took some themes from a course of advanced lectures that he had recently given at Harvard University. These had catchy titles such as ""The edge of spacetime"", ""Black holes and  thermodynamics"", and ""Quantum gravity"". In the 1980s, my office and Stephen's were in the same courtyard in central Cambridge, so I often chatted with him about publishing. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking One afternoon he invited me to take a look at the first draft, but first he wanted to discuss cash. He told me he had spent considerable time away from his research, and that he expected advances and royalties to be large. When I pressed him on the market that he foresaw, he insisted that it had to be on sale, up front, at all airport bookshops in the UK and the US. I told him that was a tough call for a university press. Then I thumbed the typescript. To my dismay, the text was far too technical for a general reader. A few weeks later he showed me a revision, much improved, but still littered with equations. I said: ""Steve, it's still too technical - every equation will halve the market."" He eventually removed all except one, E = mcÂ². And he decided, fortunately, to place it with a mass market publisher rather than a university press. Bantam published A Brief History of Time in March 1988. Sales took off like a rocket, and it ranked as a bestseller for at least five years. Total sales approached 10 million copies. The book's impact on the popularisation of science has been incalculable. Stephen was an inspirational ambassador for the power of science to provide rational accounts of the physical laws governing the natural world.

"Theresa May statement on Russian spy case UK to expel 23 Russian diplomatic staff A UN security council meeting to be held Russian ambassador criticises 'provocation' Prime Minister's Questions focused on the NHS Scroll down this page to see key clips and text commentary Russia is behind the attempted murder of an ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury, the PM believes. Britain gives them a week to leave and tells the UN Russia was to blame for a nerve agent attack on UK soil. Scotland's first minister says Russia's actions cannot be tolerated as she backs the decision to expel 23 diplomats. First minister says differences with UK government are ""not insignificant, but neither are they insurmountable"". The UK will expel 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy in Salisbury, the PM says. Theresa May said the diplomats, who have a week to leave, were identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"". She also revoked an invitation to Russia's foreign minister, and said the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup later this year. Russia denies being involved in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal. The Russian Embassy said the expulsion of 23 diplomats was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". Former spy Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill responding to the incident, and is in a serious but stable condition, but is thought to be improving.

Mr Shelbrooke asked the PM if she could repeat to MPs her faith in the intelligence services ""to be absolutely certain in the evidence"" she has received. Mrs May said she was ""surprised and shocked at the statement that's been put out"" and ""it's very clear from the remarks that have been made by backbenchers from the Labour Party, that they will be equally concerned by that remark"". Here is the full text of the briefing as published by the Press Association: Mr Corbyn's spokesman said the history of information from UK intelligence
agencies is ""problematic"" and refused to say that the Labour leader accepted
the Russian state was at fault. He told reporters: ""The government has access to information and intelligence
on this matter which others don't. ""However, also there is a history in relation to weapons of mass destruction
and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly. ""So, I think the right approach is to seek the evidence to follow
international treaties, particularly in relation to prohibitive chemical
weapons."" The Labour leader has been given security briefings on the incident.
 Asked if Mr Corbyn believed Russia was responsible for the attack, the
spokesman said Mrs May continued to leave open the possibility that Russia lost
control of the nerve agent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Conor Lamb: 'Mission accepted' A Democrat has declared victory after a cliffhanger Pennsylvania election for a congressional district that Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016. There is no official result, but Conor Lamb and Republican opponent Rick Saccone were neck-and-neck in the solidly conservative 18th district. Republican sway over the constituency is so strong that Democrats fielded no candidates in the last two votes. The contest could set the tone for November's US mid-term polls. This video can not be played This is why US gun laws probably won't change Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called the race a ""wakeup call"" for his party. With votes counted in every precinct of the working-class district, Mr Lamb was on 49.8% while Mr Saccone had 49.6%. A terrible night for Trump in Pennsylvania The Democrat was ahead by more than 600 ballots out of nearly 230,000 cast amid a nail-biting tally of absentee votes. The 33-year-old claimed victory late on Tuesday saying: ""It took a little longer than we thought but we did it. You did it."" Mr Saccone has not conceded the race. Mr Lamb is a 33-year-old socially-conservative Democrat and former federal prosecutor The outcome could shape the contours of the mid-term elections, when Republicans will fight to keep their majority in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats need 24 seats to win back control of the House, which would be the first time they would control the chamber since 2010. President Trump visited the 18th district in western Pennsylvania twice during the campaign, and Republicans spent millions of dollars to keep a hold of the seat. Despite holding a rally in the district on Saturday, the president told those around him that he viewed Mr Saccone as a ""weak"" candidate, Axios reported. The vice-president, the president's eldest son and daughter also visited the state to campaign for Mr Saccone. Mr Trump has privately criticised the candidate as ""weak"" Marine veteran Conor Lamb, a former prosecutor, has promised not to support Democratic House of Representatives leader Nancy Pelosi and has taken up moderate positions. He has said he opposes new gun restrictions, but backs expanded background checks, and declared himself opposed to abortion. Mr Lamb managed to out-fundraise his competitor by nearly 500%, and drew the support of blue-collar workers that Republicans had hoped to court with Mr Trump's new tariffs and tax cuts. Mr Saccone, 60, is a four-term state lawmaker, Air Force veteran and former counter-intelligence officer who has referred to himself as Mr Trump's ""wingman"". He was criticised late in the campaign after he said some of his opponents ""have a hatred for God"". Mr Saccone also called himself ""Trump before Trump was Trump"". The two competed to replace Tim Murphy, who resigned last October after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher If the 2018 congressional mid-terms are a coming electoral tsunami in favour of the Democrats, Tuesday's Pennsylvania special election was the ocean water receding beyond the horizon. The wave is out there, and it may only be a matter of time before it comes crashing down on the Republican Party. The results in Pennsylvania are razor thin and could still tilt either way. Given the nature of the district, however, it shouldn't have been close. Republicans drew the boundaries in 2011 to give themselves a safe seat. In two recent elections, Democrats didn't even field a congressional candidate. In 2016, Donald Trump carried the district by 20 points. Now, the political pendulum is swinging toward the Democrats in a very big way. White working-class voters, who rallied to Mr Trump, either didn't vote or opted for the Democrat. There's still time for Republicans to respond, of course. And the mid-term electorate may be different than the one that shows up for a special election in March. If seats that look like this Pennsylvania district are toss-ups in November, however, a lot of Republican candidates are going to get swept away. Celebrations will be short-lived, as the winner must begin campaigning for a seat in a different district. Due to new district boundaries imposed by the state Supreme Court in January, the 18th district will be split up into four different constituencies in November's poll. The new boundaries mean the district will not exist in its current form in November. The winner will serve out the rest of the year and then have to begin campaigning in one of the newly drawn districts. The deadline to file to run in November is 20 March.

"This video can not be played Scientist in the public eye Scientists, politicians and actors have paid tribute to world renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who has been called an ""inspiration to millions"". The British scientist, famed for his work on black holes,died peacefully at his home in Cambridge aged 76. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, one of the world's most eminent scientists, described his life as a ""triumph"". Others described him as a ""unique individual"" whose death ""has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake"". Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21 and was told he had only a few years to live. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures 'You could ask my dad anything' Stephen Hawking in quotes Cambridge remembers: 'I made some space for Stephen Hawking' Stephen Hawking: What you need to know He was known for his theories on black holes and relativity and went on to publish several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. The University of Cambridge, where Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as ""an inspiration to millions"". Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family. Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: ""His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever."" Stephen Hawking, who was born in 1942, studied physics in Oxford and later went on to Cambridge for his postgraduate research in cosmology This video can not be played Stephen Hawking's daughter Lucy: 'You could ask my dad any question' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, broadcaster Prof Brian Cox called him ""one of the greats"" and said physicists in 1,000 years' time ""will still be talking about Hawking radiation"", his theory about black holes. British astronaut Tim Peake, who flew in space in 2016, said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". And the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, praised Prof Hawking's ""colossal mind and wonderful spirit"". Many friends and fans have also hailed his humour, with actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in 2014 film biopic The Theory of Everything, calling him ""the funniest man I have ever met"". Fellow actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who also played the physicist in a 2004 BBC TV film, remembered his ""wickedly funny sense of humour"". ""He virtually created the publishing genre of popular science. I will miss our margaritas but will raise one to the stars to celebrate your life,"" he added. Benedict Cumberbatch said Prof Hawking was a ""true inspiration for me and for millions around the world"" Meanwhile, Lord Rees - who holds the most prestigious post in astronomy in the UK -recalled meeting Prof Hawking at Cambridge University in 1964,external, describing him as ""unsteady on his feet and speaking with great difficulty"" following his diagnosis with the degenerative disease. ""Even mere survival would have been a medical marvel, but of course he didn't just survive.  He became one of the most famous scientists in the world,"" Lord Rees said ""He was diagnosed with a deadly disease, and his expectations dropped to zero. He himself said that everything that happened since then was a bonus."" ""And what a triumph his life has been,"" Lord Rees added.

""As his children have said, his courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world,"" she said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute to the physicist -who was a Labour supporter- and said he ""inspired the world with his determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos"" and ""showed breathtaking courage to overcome life's adversities"". Former US President Barack Obama, who Prof Hawking met in 2009 to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, tweeted a photo of them both alongside the words: ""Have fun out there among the stars"".

Many people have praised Prof Hawking's contribution to popular culture, with Oxford University biologist Sally Le Page remarking he was ""as much as a cultural icon as a scientific one"". According to online retailer Amazon, Prof Hawking's book A Brief History of Time has risen to the top of its best sellers list following the announcement of his death on Wednesday. With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy In the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved The Royal Albert Hall said the ""genius"" Prof Hawking was the second physicist, after Albert Einstein in 1933, to ever sell out the venue with his lecture in 1995. The Motor Neurone Disease Association said Prof Hawking ""played a vital role"" in raising awareness of the disease, which kills more than half of people within two years of diagnosis.

"The professor was a fellow at Gonville and Caius College for more than 50 years As the world mourns the death of Stephen Hawking, in Cambridge - where he lived and worked - people remember a familiar face often spotted on the streets and in the university's halls. In the wake of the news, the mood in the city was not so much sombre, as one in which many recalled a visionary who had touched the lives of residents, students and academics. From ""I spotted him once in the pub"", to ""I've heard some of his inspirational talks"", the scientist was synonymous with the city, which bears the mark of his legacy. A bust in his likeness sits in Cambridge University's Centre for Theoretical Cosmology and the Stephen Hawking Building was named after Gonville and Caius College's most celebrated fellow. Outside the very site which housed his accommodation when he joined as a PhD student in 1962 is a simple sign announcing his death. Countless passers-by stop on their way to work, or to the shops, and pause to read it. ""His work is a testament to human determination,"" says history student Maddy Ducharme. Her thoughts echo many of those who have lined up to sign a book of condolence opened by the college. The theoretical physicist described Caius as ""a constant thread running through my life"" Student Maddy Ducharme says the professor showed ""such determination"" Some of those now studying at the university were inspired to study science by the professor, including physics student Arno Liu. ""When I was 12 my mum bought me A Brief History of Time. ""He wrote it in a very humorous way which kept me focused on the ideas he had. He was one of the reasons I got dragged into physics."" Obituary: Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures China's love for the late Stephen Hawking The 17-year-old was one of those who queued to sign the book of condolence. ""I quoted a Dylan Thomas poem, Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night. It's written for people not to give up, but to fight on in life."" Although he had not met the professor, Mr Liu was among those who attended Prof Hawking's 75th birthday celebrations at Gonville and Caius last year. ""Everybody was trying to chat with him but seeing him was enough for me,"" he adds. The flag flies at half mast on Prof Hawking's college, Gonville and Caius Student Amy Edwards-Knight went to the professor's birthday party last year Caius' law student Amy Edwards-Knight, 21, was also there and remembers a ""gorgeous piece of music"" which had been composed to mark the occasion. ""They had the choir perform and he gave a really lovely speech. ""He talked about what Caius had done for him, and his connections to the college, and waxed lyrical about the abilities of really understanding the universe and how he didn't think that he ultimately ever did, completely."" A bust of Prof Hawking was unveiled at his college in 2007 History student Evan Adair said Prof Hawking helped everyone to better understand the world ""I sat pretty close to him in the hall,"" adds Evan Adair, a 21-year-old student at the college. ""For me it was special. I'm a historian - I'm not a scientist - but I know that he's made a really big contribution to the way that we understand the world today."" Despite his failing health the professor still attended dinners in the college, and Caius' bar worker Jesus Gorjon remembers being asked to make room for a certain guest on one occasion. ""I was doing a dinner at the college and my boss told me to make some space for 'Stephen' and I said 'OK'. ""I didn't know who 'Stephen' was, but when I saw it was him, I was like, 'oh, I've made some space for Stephen Hawking'."" Jesus Gorjon is proud to have been asked to make room for Prof Hawking in the college dining hall The professor also surprised TV actor Stephen McGann, who ran into him at Antonio Carluccio's restaurant in Cambridge. Paying tribute on Twitter,external, the Call the Midwife star said: ""To anybody who lives in or near Cambridge, Stephen Hawking was a constant reminder of brilliance that wants to share the same air. ""You would come across him in the street - in cafes or shops. I last saw him at the next table in Carluccio's. I'll miss that."" Allow Twitter content?

As people mourn the passing of the man whom many held in awe, those in his home city are fondly remembering a familiar man about town. Several recall  ""coming across"" the scientist in the street. ""He ran over my foot years ago on King's Parade,"" one wrote on Twitter. Another replied: ""I can top that - I nearly crashed into him on my bike."" But Ms Ducharme sums it up for many when she says: ""Professor Hawking showed such inspiration, such determination.

"This video can not be played The scientist is the voice of the latest version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For all of his academic work on mind-boggling scientific concepts, Stephen Hawking was also known to many for something else: his many cameos on TV, film and radio. His most recent was broadcast just last week, as the voice of the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy Mark II - a powerful being known on our planet as Prof Hawking. ""I have been quite popular in my time,"" the character says in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation. ""Some even read my books."" It's that self-deprecating humour that characterised Prof Hawking's appearances. Here's a brief look at some of them. The Simpsons Prof Hawking once commented that ""almost as many people know me through The Simpsons as through my science"". Whether that's true is debatable - but his stints on the long-running cartoon have been among his most memorable guest appearances. He first appeared in 1999 episode They Saved Lisa's Brain, with his wheelchair loaded with gadgets. He not only knocks out Principal Skinner, using a boxing glove on a spring, but then flies off with the help of helicopter blades, saving Lisa Simpson from a collapsing bandstand in the process. He also tells Homer his doughnut-shaped universe theory is ""intriguing"" - and that he may steal it. ""I hope I wouldn't use the boxing glove - though sometimes I am sorely tempted,"" he said. ""But helicopter blades would be very useful."" His cartoon self came about as his daughter Lucy knew one of the scriptwriters. ""The episode was very funny,"" he added. Little Britain for Comic Relief Prof Hawking with David Walliams and Catherine Tate Prof Hawking had the mother of all wheelchair adaptations when it allowed him to become a transformer-type machine in a Little Britain sketch for Comic Relief. He's seen being pushed through the grounds of a college at the University of Cambridge by Lou Todd - usually seen with wheelchair user Andy Pipkin. When Prof Hawking gets fed up with Lou's patronising chat (about Peppa Pig, among other things), he says: ""Professor Stephen Hawking bot, transform"". He blasts Catherine Tate (playing an equally patronising nun) with a ray gun before chasing after Lou and turning the gun on him, before leaving the scene with a ""ha ha ha"". The Big Bang Theory Sheldon gets to hand over his paper on the Higgs boson to his idol in The Hawking Excitation - which has also seen Howard working on Prof Hawking's wheelchair when he comes to their university to lecture. When Sheldon meets Prof Hawking, he tells him it's an ""honour and a privilege"" to meet him - to which Prof Hawking replies: ""I know."" He then goes on to tell Sheldon he's made a mistake in one of his calculations, causing Sheldon to faint. ""Great, another fainter,"" he says. In another episode, The Extract Obliteration, he appears making a phone call to Sheldon - having played a game of Words With Friends online with him. He calls Sheldon ""Dr Loser"" instead of Dr Cooper and asks: ""What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck."" Comic Relief originals Allow YouTube content?

The ""renowned scientist and occasional sitcom star"" is seen auditioning celebrities all hoping to provide his new voice in another clip for Comic Relief. Prof Hawking listens to pleas from stars including Liam Neeson, Rebel Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kylie Minogue as they all seek to persuade him to use their vocal talents. ""No, not a chance"" he tells Simon Cowell, before slightly swearily telling Gordon Ramsay: ""I don't think anyone would take me (beeped out) seriously if I sounded like that.""

Prof Hawking pre-recorded a clip with Brian Cox for Monty Python's 2014 live reunion shows - in which he's seen running over his fellow physicist as he's explaining the expansion of the universe. ""I think you're being pedantic,"" he tells Prof Cox as he knocks him over (well, or a stunt double does), before launching into a version of Monty Python's The Galaxy Song. Star Trek: The Next Generation Prof Hawking with the characters of Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton In an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, he appeared as a hologram playing cards with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. When Sir Isaac pompously started to explain how he discovered gravity, Hawking protested: ""Not the apple story again."" Off camera, as he was being shown the USS Enterprise's warp drive, he reportedly quipped: ""I'm working on that."" Futurama In TV animation Futurama, the perennially dim Phillip J Fry asked Prof Hawking: ""Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?''. The scientist, playing himself, replied: ""Sure. Why not?"" He appeared in a total of three episodes of the animated series. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"BP holds a 20% stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft A crackdown on Russia's UK business ties in the wake of the spy poison revelations will hit a complex and lucrative web of interests. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised measures against Moscow if there is no adequate explanation for the poisoning. But she would be pushing against interests that touch UK football, members of the House of Lords, and valuable assets owned by UK companies. Those assets include BP's 20% stake in Russian oil and gas giant Rosneft. That's worth repeating - a FTSE 100 company owns a fifth of Russia's most valuable company, which is state controlled. BP's chief executive Bob Dudley sits on a board that is chaired by close Putin-associate Igor Sechin. So far, the two companies have managed to find a way to carry on business despite sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea. Mr Dudley often has to leave the room during board meetings when matters pertaining personally to Mr Sechin arise as he is on a list of sanctioned persons. If sanctions get tougher - how will BP manage an asset that provides a third of its global oil production? So far the stock market has not moved to apply a discount to BP's holding, and sources close to the company have said they hope that any sanctions would target individuals rather than important foreign assets. But if the gloves really come off, what action would Russia take? A former executive of a telecoms company with a Russian subsidiary told me just how difficult Russia can make life. After the invasion of Crimea, Russia told the company to change all the phone numbers in Crimea to give them a Russian rather than Ukrainian prefix. Failure to do so would result in their licence to operate being suspended. Russia demands evidence of UK spy poison How could the UK retaliate against Russia? The London Stock Exchange recently accepted a listing from EN+, a metals company controlled by Oleg Deripaska, who you may remember was courted by both Lord Mandelson and former Chancellor George Osborne aboard his yacht. Now Mr Deripaska is not on the sanctioned persons list but -as I reported in November last year- the proceeds of the London share sale were used to pay down his debt to sanctioned Russian bank VTB. Russian interests are tied up with Chelsea and Arsenal football clubs The ties go deeper. Greg (Lord) Barker, former Energy Minister under David Cameron, is the non-executive chairman of EN+. There is nothing illegal or sanctions-busting in that, but it serves an illustrative tip of the iceberg of the huge amounts of work that UK advisers, lawyers and bankers derive from advising Russian customers located here and in Russia. Messrs Usmanov and Abramovich have taken a chunk of the hallowed turf of the Emirates (Arsenal) and Stamford Bridge (Chelsea) and have operated perfectly legally here. But both are on good terms with Vladimir Putin. If the way to hurt Putin is to hurt his friends, how far is the UK prepared to go? Is it ready to send a message that Russian money and business is not welcome in the UK just as Brexit looms. After expelling diplomats, one way for the UK to retaliate is to target Russian's huge UK property holdings. The Criminal Finance Act could be used to look more deeply into how the money used to buy premium London property was acquired. It is unlikely there will be widespread sympathy for the estate agents who make their money flogging penthouses to oligarchs, but Russian business has become an important fact of UK public life and the government may find it hard to target any new sanctions precisely enough not to deter valuable, legal business. There are other options - such as boycotting football's World Cup - but how many other countries would follow suit? Europe is also much more dependent on supplies of Russian gas than the UK. With Donald Trump pursuing a protectionist trade policy and with his hands full in North Korea, Theresa May's biggest test may be the amount of international support she can command.

"As the world mourns Prof Stephen Hawking, who has died aged 76, there has been a particular outpouring of emotion in China, where the visionary physicist was revered by scientists, students, the state and even boy band stars. ""He will roam across the universe and its galaxies, and in the end will again become its brightest star,"" said one commenter on the Chinese microblogging network Weibo. Another said: ""He belongs to the stars, and has returned home now."" Many people in China grew up reading Prof Hawking's seminal book A Brief History of Time -the circulation of the Chinese-language edition is reportedly second only to that of the English.,external Hawking is very popular on Weibo His 2006 visit to China was covered with breathless excitement, withstate media comparing his appeal to that of Tom Cruise,external. Andwhen he joined Weibo in 2016- saying hello to ""my friends in China"" - he was met with a rapturous response, amassing millions of followers within hours. Prof Hawking was, of course, beloved around the world, but the adulation and respect he has always commanded in China is perhaps in another universe altogether. Scholars and academics have traditionally been held in high regard in Chinese culture, which also prizes a hard-striving and disciplined work ethic. Having overcome great odds in his life, he was seen as having these qualities in spades. Obituary: Stephen Hawking 'Without imperfection, you or I would not exist': Hawking in his own words In pictures: A life of extremes How one man 'transformed our view of the universe' ""We all admire his creativity and his spirit of research, despite the extreme difficulty of his physical situation,"" Tsinghua University professor Shing-tung Yau told the BBC. Prof Yau, who helped to arrange Prof Hawking's visits to China, added: ""He was very friendly and was willing to explain physics to laymen. His smile attracted the attention of everybody... the Chinese are grateful for his generosity in spending time in China."" A cartoon on Weibo depicts Hawking's famous wheelchair with the caption: ""Travel well, you who is in a parallel world"". Prof Hawking also came along at a time when modern China began accelerating its scientific and space ambitions. Thus, a role model ideal for the Chinese state to champion emerged. ""Hawking has near-superstar status in China, and the Chinese government preaches that scientific prowess is crucial to the country's future power,"" reads one report carried by state media in 2006. It also helped that he was generally not critical of China - at first - and was happy to play to the crowd. ""I like Chinese culture, Chinese food and above all Chinese women. They are beautiful,"" he told his audience at an appearance during his last trip, while also praising the Chinese for being ""very clever"", ""hardworking"" and having ""achieved a lot in science and technology"". This video can not be played 'The king is dead' - China mourns Stephen Hawking More recently, he delighted younger Chinese when he interacted online with another Weibo star. Wang Junkai, the lead singer of popular boy band TFBoys, had in November asked Hawking a question about interstellar migration, and ProfHawking praised him for asking an ""excellent question"".,external After news of his death emerged Wang posted on social media: ""You will forever belong to the universe and the stars. I will etch your teachings on my heart."" But in his later years Prof Hawking had some criticism, most notably for one of his greatest concerns - artificial intelligence. In a video appearance in Beijing last year,he warned China of the rise of powerful AI,,externalsaying ""we should do all we can to ensure that its [AI's] future development benefits us and our environment"". China is now one of the world's leaders in investing, developing and using AI technology, such as using facial recognition to catch criminals - and to keep a close eye on the population. This video can not be played In your face: China's all-seeing surveillance system But he also genuinely believed in China, particularly its younger generations and their power to change the world, and sometimes addressed them directly on Weibo. In 2016 he wrote a special message of encouragement to Chinese students taking the importantgaokaocollege entrance exam, telling them to ""be fearless"". In his response to Wang, he praised China's millennials for being curious and thinking about the future. ""My hope is that as you pursue science and other ideas, this curiosity and confidence will continue,"" he wrote. And in one of his last posts on Weibo, he thanked his millions of followers. ""It has been an illuminating experience being able to communicate with all of you here. ""I look forward to seeing what the talent and inquisitiveness of the Chinese people achieves in the realms of science and space."" His obvious affection for China has perhaps intensified the sense of loss among young Chinese. The professor joked while in China that he found Chinese women ""very beautiful"" Among the moving tributes written by a netizen and highlighted by state media was this: ""Born in the ordinary dust, returned to the stars above. ""I encountered this person when I was in secondary school. He told me of mankind's indestructible and legendary perseverance. He also unveiled to me the mysterious secrets of the universe's black holes. I listened to his prophecies, I accepted science's revelations. ""This person has disappeared from our blue Earth, he has gone to explore the universe he so yearned to see. Have a smooth journey, Stephen Hawking."" ""I'm scared,"" said another. ""[I've] Suddenly lost a sense of security about Earth.""

"Jim Bowen with Bullseye mascot Bully Broadcaster and comedian Jim Bowen, best known for hosting darts-based game show Bullseye in the 1980s and '90s, has died at the age of 80. His wife Phyllis confirmed the news to BBC Radio Lancashire. The former deputy headmaster, who lived in North Lancashire, began his career as a stand-up comedian on the club circuit in the 1960s. He became a household name when he began presenting Bullseye in 1981. The Sunday tea time show ran for 14 years. It attracted 17.5 million viewers at its peak and involved three pairs of contestants - with a ""thrower"", who would throw the darts, and a ""knower"", who would answer general knowledge questions. Bullseye's prizes included cars and speedboats Bowen became known for catchphrases including ""Super, smashing, great"", ""You can't beat a bit of Bully!"" and ""Let's look at what you could have won"". Another favourite phrase - ""keep out of the black and in to the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed"" - referred to the segments of the darts board that the players had to hit. His warm-hearted and quick-witted rapport with the contestants was a big part of the show's appeal. Bowen became Bullseye host after appearing on ITV show The Comedians, alongside the likes of Frank Carson, Russ Abbott and Bernard Manning. He also had a number of TV acting roles, including in Muck and Brass, Jonathan Creek, The Grimleys, and as Hoss Cartwright in the second series of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights. Allow Twitter content?

""I watched seven hours of Ken Dodd and I watched him completely decimate 7,000 people. He left them in ruins with laughter,"" he told Radio Lancashire last year. ""And I thought, that's some feeling that he must get after that. And so I learned his act."" Bowen diedtwo days after his hero. Allow Twitter content?

His agent Patsy Martin told the Press Association: ""I will very sadly miss Jim. He was a very lovely, genuine man.""

"This video can not be played Thousands of students protest for gun reform Students and school staff across the US are commemorating the Florida school shooting with a walkout, exactly one month after the killings. They are stopping lessons for 17 minutes in memory of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Pupils at the school, which was targeted by a former student, hugged each other on the football field. Protest organisers accuse Congress of failing to tackle gun violence. The White Houserevealed a plan this week to deter school shootingswhich does not include President Donald Trump's repeated calls to raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles to 21. Instead, it moves ahead with his controversial proposal to provide firearms training to school employees. A student fastens a pin to her friend during a rally in Brooklyn, NY Students gathered outside the White House as part of the nationwide protest The walkouts included moments of silence to remember the shooting victims Tales of heroism from Florida attack Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The walkouts began at 10:00 in the eastern US (14:00 GMT) and moved west across America's time zones. Organisers of the National School Walkout, who were also behind the Women's March in January 2017 against Mr Trump's inauguration, called on ""students, teachers, school administrators, parents and allies"" to take part. On their website,,externalthey accuse Congress of ""inaction to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing"" schools and neighbourhoods. Schools taking part included Colorado's Columbine High School where 13 people were shot dead by two students in 1999. ""I should be writing my college essay, not my will"" a student's sign in New York says Students in the Washington DC area marched to Congress and the White House Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School walked to the football field In Parkland, families and supporters applauded as thousands of students slowly marched on to the Stoneman Douglas school football field. School principal Ty Thompson called on them to stage the ""biggest group hug"". A large crowd of students from the Washington DC area gathered outside the White House holding signs reading ""Protect People Not Guns"" and chanting ""Never again"" and ""Enough is enough"". Some students also gathered at Capitol Hill where they were addressed by the Senate and House Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. ""We're all moved by your eloquence and your fearless insistence on action to prevent gun violence,"" Ms Pelosi told them. ""Thank you for bringing your urgency to this fight, to the doorstep of America, the doorstep of the Capitol of the United States."" Students in suburban Chicago honoured members of their own community who have been killed with guns Students in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, stood in a heart formation to pay tribute to the Parkland victims. In New York, hundreds of students from Fiorello H LaGuardia High School - many dressed in orange, the colour of the gun-control movement - took to the streets of Manhattan. ""Thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" read one sign. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also joined protesters for a symbolic ""die-in"" - lying down in a street in Lower Manhattan.

The disruption to the school day is opposed by some schools, notably in one Texas district where students who walk out have been told they face a three-day suspension. ""We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved,"" said Needville schools superintendent Curtis Rhode. In New Jersey, student Rosa Rodriquez has reportedly received a suspension after disobeying the school's order to remain in the auditorium to mark the walkout.

The former pupil arrived on campus and began shooting students and staff before abandoning the weapon and escaping, according to court documents. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' Fourteen students and three members of staff died. US prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the attacker who has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened The US House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 407-10 in support of a bill to authorise $50m (Â£36m) in federal grants for training, anonymous reporting systems, threat assessments, intervention teams and school and police coordination. It does not address gun control. It is unclear when the Senate, which is expected to take up a separate measure to strengthen background checks for gun buyers, will consider the bill. US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi addressed students outside the US Capitol The House measure would not allow the approved funding to be used to arm teachers or school personnel, a provision the White House has backed.

"Claire Foy, Queen Elizabeth in the acclaimed Netflix series The Crown, was paid less than her on-screen Duke of Edinburgh Matt Smith. Despite Foy's Golden Globe-winning performance, Smith's previous work on Dr Who earned him higher pay, the show's producers said. They said it would not be the case for the third series, whenOlivia Colman replaces Foy. It is the latest example of the gender pay gap in the industry. Earlier this year it was disclosed that Michelle Williams was paid a fraction of what her All The Money In The World co-star Mark Wahlberg earned for reshooting sections of the movie. According to Hollywood trade publication Variety,external, The Crown's producers said Smith's Dr Who fame meant he commanded a bigger salary. Foy, 33, who before The Crown appeared in the BBC's Wolf Hall, was reportedly paid $40,000 (Â£28,000) per episode for the first two series, which portrayed the monarch in the 1950s and 1960s. It is unclear what Smith was paid. Claire Foy and Matt Smith will be replaced as The Crown moves into the 1970s The Crown co-producer Suzanne Mackie told a television industry conference in Jerusalem that the pay difference would be rectified. ""Going forward, no-one gets paid more than the queen,"" Variety quoted Ms Mackie as saying. For the third series, which moves into the 1970s, Prince Philip will also be played by a different actor. The Crown is one of the most expensive television shows ever produced, costing about $130m (Â£93m) for the first season alone. Does The Crown cost more than the actual Queen? The ongoing disparity between men and women in the entertainment business is reflected in annual lists published by Forbes magazine. Wahlberg was paid $1.5m to do a reshoot of All The Money in the World, but his co-star was paid $80 a day In 2017, Emma Stone topped the best-paid actress list with $26m (Â£18m), while Mark Wahlberg was the highest paid man with $68m in estimated annual earnings. When it was revealed that Wahlberg was paid $1.5m (Â£1m) for his All the Money in the World reshoots - while his co-star Michelle Williams got $1,000 -he donated the money to Time's Up, the campaign against workplace sexual misconduct.

"Bradford, where race riots erupted 17 years ago, is one of the five places adopting the plan Five English councils are to adopt new integration plans to deal with problems of segregation. The government's Integrated Communities Strategy will see Â£50m invested in schemes to improve community relations over the next two years. Bradford, Blackburn, Peterborough, Walsall and Waltham Forest in London have been selected for special help. The plan includes schemes to encourage pupils to form lasting relationships with those from different backgrounds. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, launching a consultation paper on the plan, said Britain ""cannot ignore the fact that in too many parts of our country, communities are divided"". ""Successive governments have refused to deal with the integration challenges we face head on, preferring to let people muddle along and live isolated and separated lives,"" he said. Proposals in the Integrated Communities Strategy include: Extra support for English language classes Targeted help to improve the economic opportunities for people - particularly women - in segregated communities Schemes to encourage school pupils to form lasting relationships with those from different backgrounds Increased take up of the National Citizen Service - a project launched by then-PM David Cameron which sees groups of 16 and 17-year olds carry out community projects Promoting British values in the school curriculum The strategy is the latest in a long line of government initiatives to try to deal with one of Britain's most sensitive and enduring social challenges. In 2016 theCasey Review,externalwarned segregation and social exclusion were at ""worrying levels"" and were fuelling inequality in some areas of Britain.

"This video can not be played Toys R Us administrator explains why the company was too difficult to sell All Toys R Us stores in the UK will close in the next six weeks following the chain's collapse into administration. Attempts to find a buyer for the US retailer's 100 stores in the UK have failed. Twenty five stores have either closed in recent days or are due to shut by Thursday. The collapse will put more than 3,000 people out of work as a dismal period for the retail sector continues. Administrators Moorfields Advisory were appointed last monthto start winding down the UK's biggest toy retailer after it struggled to pay a Â£15m tax bill. Simon Thomas, joint administrator, said Moorfields' had negotiated with 120 different parties, most of them interested in buying up stock, and half a dozen looking at the whole business. But in the end Mr Thomas said the business had simply proved too hard to sell. He told the BBC: ""Any potential purchaser would have difficulty in sorting things out, for instance getting the rights to use the name, which is held by the American parent. ""In addition there are many services provided within the group by different subsidiaries, so if you take over one part you have to make alternative arrangements or negotiate new terms. Put all that together and becomes very complicated."" Mr Thomas said remaining stock would be discounted further and ""it should be an opportunity for people to buy some nice toys at a good price."" The administrators said that Toys R Us had outstanding liabilities of around Â£300m, including a Â£70-90m pension fund shortfall. The US parent company filed for bankruptcy in September and reports suggest it may start closing its 800 stores in the US as early as this week. The business was bought in 2005 by a group of investors including private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR, which loaded it with some $5bn (Â£3.6bn) in debt.  The company was crippled by interest payments which at times reached $400m a year. In the UK Toys R Us joins a long list of high street retailers including Maplin and Claire's that have run into difficulties this year. Many have been hit by changes in consumer spending habits, a squeeze on disposable income, higher inflation and the national living wage, and the prospect next month of increases in business rates.

"This video can not be played Conor Lamb: 'Mission accepted' A Democrat has declared victory after a cliffhanger Pennsylvania election for a congressional district that Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016. There is no official result, but Conor Lamb and Republican opponent Rick Saccone were neck-and-neck in the solidly conservative 18th district. Republican sway over the constituency is so strong that Democrats fielded no candidates in the last two votes. The contest could set the tone for November's US mid-term polls. This video can not be played This is why US gun laws probably won't change Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called the race a ""wakeup call"" for his party. With votes counted in every precinct of the working-class district, Mr Lamb was on 49.8% while Mr Saccone had 49.6%. A terrible night for Trump in Pennsylvania The Democrat was ahead by more than 600 ballots out of nearly 230,000 cast amid a nail-biting tally of absentee votes. The 33-year-old claimed victory late on Tuesday saying: ""It took a little longer than we thought but we did it. You did it."" Mr Saccone has not conceded the race. Mr Lamb is a 33-year-old socially-conservative Democrat and former federal prosecutor The outcome could shape the contours of the mid-term elections, when Republicans will fight to keep their majority in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats need 24 seats to win back control of the House, which would be the first time they would control the chamber since 2010. President Trump visited the 18th district in western Pennsylvania twice during the campaign, and Republicans spent millions of dollars to keep a hold of the seat. Despite holding a rally in the district on Saturday, the president told those around him that he viewed Mr Saccone as a ""weak"" candidate, Axios reported. The vice-president, the president's eldest son and daughter also visited the state to campaign for Mr Saccone. Mr Trump has privately criticised the candidate as ""weak"" Marine veteran Conor Lamb, a former prosecutor, has promised not to support Democratic House of Representatives leader Nancy Pelosi and has taken up moderate positions. He has said he opposes new gun restrictions, but backs expanded background checks, and declared himself opposed to abortion. Mr Lamb managed to out-fundraise his competitor by nearly 500%, and drew the support of blue-collar workers that Republicans had hoped to court with Mr Trump's new tariffs and tax cuts. Mr Saccone, 60, is a four-term state lawmaker, Air Force veteran and former counter-intelligence officer who has referred to himself as Mr Trump's ""wingman"". He was criticised late in the campaign after he said some of his opponents ""have a hatred for God"". Mr Saccone also called himself ""Trump before Trump was Trump"". The two competed to replace Tim Murphy, who resigned last October after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher If the 2018 congressional mid-terms are a coming electoral tsunami in favour of the Democrats, Tuesday's Pennsylvania special election was the ocean water receding beyond the horizon. The wave is out there, and it may only be a matter of time before it comes crashing down on the Republican Party. The results in Pennsylvania are razor thin and could still tilt either way. Given the nature of the district, however, it shouldn't have been close. Republicans drew the boundaries in 2011 to give themselves a safe seat. In two recent elections, Democrats didn't even field a congressional candidate. In 2016, Donald Trump carried the district by 20 points. Now, the political pendulum is swinging toward the Democrats in a very big way. White working-class voters, who rallied to Mr Trump, either didn't vote or opted for the Democrat. There's still time for Republicans to respond, of course. And the mid-term electorate may be different than the one that shows up for a special election in March. If seats that look like this Pennsylvania district are toss-ups in November, however, a lot of Republican candidates are going to get swept away. Celebrations will be short-lived, as the winner must begin campaigning for a seat in a different district. Due to new district boundaries imposed by the state Supreme Court in January, the 18th district will be split up into four different constituencies in November's poll. The new boundaries mean the district will not exist in its current form in November. The winner will serve out the rest of the year and then have to begin campaigning in one of the newly drawn districts. The deadline to file to run in November is 20 March.

"The Britain First Facebook page had attracted more than two million likes Facebook has removed the pages of the anti-Islamic group Britain First and its leaders. The social media company said the group had repeatedly violated its community standards. Earlier this month, Britain First's leader and deputy leader, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, were jailed after being found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. More than two million people had liked the group's Facebook page. The pages of Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen also had large followings. Facebook says the decision,externalto remove the pages was made after Britain First had ignored a final warning about the posting of material that broke its community standards. The group will not be allowed to set up a replacement page. It is understood that Facebook judged the videos and photos to be designed to incite hatred against Muslims. Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that she welcomed the move and hoped other tech companies would follow. London's mayor, Sadiq Khan has also issued a statement. ""Britain First is a vile and hate-fuelled group,"" he said. ""Their sick intentions to incite hatred within our society via social media are reprehensible, and Facebook's decision to remove their content is welcome."" It is understood the offending posts included: a photo of the group's leaders with the caption ""Islamophobic and Proud"" a caption comparing Muslim immigrants with animals multiple videos posted deliberately to incite hateful comments against Muslims In a blog, Facebook said it was an open platform for all ideas but that political views should be expressed without hate. ""People can express robust and controversial opinions without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are."" There has been pressure for some time on Facebook to act against Britain First. The Facebook pages of party leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, have also been removed The social media company says it removes hate speech against people based on their race, religion, gender and other characteristics. Its community standards document states: ""Organisations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook."" Twitter suspended the accounts of Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, after its new anti-abuse rules came into force last December. US President Donald Trump had retweeted anti-Islamic videos posted by Fransen the previous month.

"Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket, said annual profits jumped 11% as its turnaround programme continues. The chain made underlying pre-tax profits of Â£374m in the year to 4 February, Â£37m higher than in 2016. Like-for-like sales, which strip out stores open for less than a year, were 2.8% higher excluding fuel. The retailer said performance was strong despite the ""challenges"" of higher import costs. Revenues rose Â£1bn to Â£17.3bn and chairman Andrew Higginson said Morrisons was now entering its third consecutive year of growth. However, by the close of trading in London, its shares were 4.86% lower. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said there was a ""sense that this kind of growth will be difficult to maintain, but this has been the argument for some time and has continually been wrong"". Morrisons announced a special dividend of 4p per share, which the firm said reflected its good progress and expectations for continued growth. One of the chain's priorities is to become more competitive. At Christmas, it said a basket of key items was the same price as the same time last year despite higher costs. Last month, Morrisons announced it would cut 1,500 middle management jobs. Laith Khalaf, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said the supermarket's largely UK supply chain had helped to ""keep prices competitive, in a market where the falling pound has increased the cost of imported food"". Although margins had slipped slightly, he said rising sales had helped bolster the bottom line, with the higher profits attributed to lower borrowing costs. Mr Khalaf added: ""Morrisons is carving out a place in the winner's camp. On top of improved performance in its retail outlets, the group is also laying the foundations of a wholesale business, with deals in place to supply McColl's newsagents, as well as the expanding Amazon Prime grocery offering.""

"Theresa May statement on Russian spy case UK to expel 23 Russian diplomatic staff A UN security council meeting to be held Russian ambassador criticises 'provocation' Prime Minister's Questions focused on the NHS Scroll down this page to see key clips and text commentary Russia is behind the attempted murder of an ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury, the PM believes. Britain gives them a week to leave and tells the UN Russia was to blame for a nerve agent attack on UK soil. Scotland's first minister says Russia's actions cannot be tolerated as she backs the decision to expel 23 diplomats. First minister says differences with UK government are ""not insignificant, but neither are they insurmountable"". The UK will expel 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy in Salisbury, the PM says. Theresa May said the diplomats, who have a week to leave, were identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"". She also revoked an invitation to Russia's foreign minister, and said the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup later this year. Russia denies being involved in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal. The Russian Embassy said the expulsion of 23 diplomats was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". Former spy Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill responding to the incident, and is in a serious but stable condition, but is thought to be improving.

Mr Shelbrooke asked the PM if she could repeat to MPs her faith in the intelligence services ""to be absolutely certain in the evidence"" she has received. Mrs May said she was ""surprised and shocked at the statement that's been put out"" and ""it's very clear from the remarks that have been made by backbenchers from the Labour Party, that they will be equally concerned by that remark"". Here is the full text of the briefing as published by the Press Association: Mr Corbyn's spokesman said the history of information from UK intelligence
agencies is ""problematic"" and refused to say that the Labour leader accepted
the Russian state was at fault. He told reporters: ""The government has access to information and intelligence
on this matter which others don't. ""However, also there is a history in relation to weapons of mass destruction
and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly. ""So, I think the right approach is to seek the evidence to follow
international treaties, particularly in relation to prohibitive chemical
weapons."" The Labour leader has been given security briefings on the incident.
 Asked if Mr Corbyn believed Russia was responsible for the attack, the
spokesman said Mrs May continued to leave open the possibility that Russia lost
control of the nerve agent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts asks the PM whether the UK is still exporting nuclear substances to Russia and asks if stopping this should be among the first sanctions imposed.

He asks whether holding this year's World Cup in Russia could be seen as a ""global vindication"" of Russia. He suggests exploring the possibility of postponing the event until 2019 so that it can be held in a ""more appropriate"" country. Theresa May replies that it's a matter for the sporting authorities.

Theresa May says people ""will take their own conclusions"" from Mr Corbyn's comments earlier but welcomes ""the positive messages of support that have come from the Labour back benches"". Salisbury incident statement House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Vernon Coaker says the UK should not ban broadcasts by Russia's RT news channel. Mr Coaker says he supports a free media and there should be a message from the UK to RT that ""we're not frightened of it"". Theresa May says a decision on RT is a matter for regulator Ofcom, not for the government.

House of CommonsParliament During the exchanges, it's been notable how many Labour MPs have given their support to the Prime Minister's statement - with some seeing implied criticism of their own frontbench.

House of CommonsParliament Conservative Simon Hoare asked if the government and security services were doing all they could to keep his North Dorset residents safe after the Met Police and Army were spotted in the area removing vehicles and items connected to the Salisbury incident. Mrs May replied that the police investigation was continuing but she could not say where it will take the police. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Ben Bradshaw tells the PM, to cheers, that ""most of us on these benches fully support the measures you have set out today"". He asks that the intelligence and security services look at Putin's influence on UK universities, think-tanks, financial institutions and political parties.

Mr Trump officially fired Mr Tillerson via Twitter, naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. What Pompeo means for US foreign policy Where it went wrong for Rex Mr Trump also named Gina Haspel to become the CIA's first female director.

Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone's interest."" Sounding breathless and looking shaken, Mr Tillerson said he had spoken to the president to ensure clarity in the days ahead. Although Mr Tillerson will not officially leave until 31 March, his deputy John Sullivan will take over running the state department pending the confirmation of Mr Pompeo.

""We got along actually quite well, but we disagreed on things,"" said the president. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. ""With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it's going to go very well."" Mr Tillerson is the latest in a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Mr Trump took office. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? 'You're fired!' - A reality TV White House? The White House and Mr Tillerson have had a series of public disagreements - and that continued until the very end. The two sides have offered different accounts of when the secretary of state was told he was being fired. The White House insists Mr Tillerson received a phone call on Friday from Chief of Staff John Kelly, who told him that he was being let go. They say Mr Tillerson then asked if the announcement could be held until his return from a tour of Africa. The top US diplomat's team said he felt unwell on Saturday and decided to cut short his tour by a day. His firing was reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday before any tweet was sent, according to a White House official. But a statement released by Under Secretary Steve Goldstein implied that Mr Tillerson was first made aware of his firing by President Trump's tweet. ""The secretary did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason,"" he said. After this statement was released Mr Goldstein himself was fired by the White House. Mr Tillerson also said he received a call from the president about three hours after Mr Trump sent a tweet announcing his departure. Rex Tillerson - Trump's former top diplomat Reaction to his firing Analysis byJon Sopel, BBCNorth America editor The end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long. Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways. The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted. Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet. The career of a one-time giant of corporate America had come to an ignominious end. Read Jon's analysis in full This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: Meet America's new top diplomat A US Senate report found that Ms Haspel ran a CIA prison in Thailand where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002. The CIA deputy director was also accused of destroying dozens of videotapes of interrogations at the camp. Gina Haspel - first female CIA director nominee Mr Pompeo is a hardline conservative former lawmaker from Kansas and a Trump loyalist. In 2014, he defended the CIA officers who waterboarded detainees as ""patriots"". Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat Both the new secretary of state and CIA director will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports had swirled since last year of a rift between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat. Last October Mr Tillerson was forced to convene a news conference to deny claims he planned to quit, though he did not address a report that he had referred to his boss as a ""moron"" after a Pentagon meeting. This video can not be played Trump says goodbye to Tillerson: 'I like Rex a lot, but we disagreed' Mr Trump also publicly undercut the former Texas oilman by tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea. In December, the secretary of state offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. Battles ahead after another sacking from Trump Cabinet The White House - which insisted North Korea must first accept any negotiations would be about giving up its nuclear arsenal - distanced itself from his remarks.

"Claire Foy, Queen Elizabeth in the acclaimed Netflix series The Crown, was paid less than her on-screen Duke of Edinburgh Matt Smith. Despite Foy's Golden Globe-winning performance, Smith's previous work on Dr Who earned him higher pay, the show's producers said. They said it would not be the case for the third series, whenOlivia Colman replaces Foy. It is the latest example of the gender pay gap in the industry. Earlier this year it was disclosed that Michelle Williams was paid a fraction of what her All The Money In The World co-star Mark Wahlberg earned for reshooting sections of the movie. According to Hollywood trade publication Variety,external, The Crown's producers said Smith's Dr Who fame meant he commanded a bigger salary. Foy, 33, who before The Crown appeared in the BBC's Wolf Hall, was reportedly paid $40,000 (Â£28,000) per episode for the first two series, which portrayed the monarch in the 1950s and 1960s. It is unclear what Smith was paid. Claire Foy and Matt Smith will be replaced as The Crown moves into the 1970s The Crown co-producer Suzanne Mackie told a television industry conference in Jerusalem that the pay difference would be rectified. ""Going forward, no-one gets paid more than the queen,"" Variety quoted Ms Mackie as saying. For the third series, which moves into the 1970s, Prince Philip will also be played by a different actor. The Crown is one of the most expensive television shows ever produced, costing about $130m (Â£93m) for the first season alone. Does The Crown cost more than the actual Queen? The ongoing disparity between men and women in the entertainment business is reflected in annual lists published by Forbes magazine. Wahlberg was paid $1.5m to do a reshoot of All The Money in the World, but his co-star was paid $80 a day In 2017, Emma Stone topped the best-paid actress list with $26m (Â£18m), while Mark Wahlberg was the highest paid man with $68m in estimated annual earnings. When it was revealed that Wahlberg was paid $1.5m (Â£1m) for his All the Money in the World reshoots - while his co-star Michelle Williams got $1,000 -he donated the money to Time's Up, the campaign against workplace sexual misconduct. Wahlberg donates reshoot fee to Time's Up Globe stars hit out at gender pay gap Most firms pay men more than women Olivia Colman 'thrilled' by Queen role Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Telford police chief 'not playing down child sex abuse' Reports on the scale of sexual abuse in Telford are ""sensationalised"", a police chief has said. The Sunday Mirror said it uncovered Britain's ""worst ever"" child grooming scandal,external, with up to 1,000 girls abused by grooming gangs since the 1980s. One victim told how she was abused at a ""rape house"" and the town's MP Lucy Allan said girls were being traded for sex in a ""routine way"". West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding ""significantly disputed"" the figures. ""I don't believe Telford is any worse than lots of places across England and Wales,"" he said. This video can not be played Telford abuse: 'I was sold twice a night' The Sunday Mirror said its report revealed ""abuse on unprecedented levels"". ""Holly"" - a victim of exploitation in the town from the age of 14 - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she went to a sexual health clinic for the morning-after pill twice a week for three years, but no-one ever asked her any questions. She said she was beaten with a belt and sold ""two or three times a night"". Ms Allan told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that white working class girls were targeted because of their backgrounds. This video can not be played White working class girls traded for sex, says MP But reports of the scale of the abuse, and the background of victims, have been questioned. Supt Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford, said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people"" who were victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) or considered ""at risk"".

He added: ""Therefore, I significantly dispute the 1,000 plus figure and do feel it is sensationalised. ""Read the headlines, read the reports. What are they actually discussing? They're discussing cases from 20 or 30 years ago, offending back in the 1990s. ""We've never said there aren't cases, there are always cases we are working on and seeking to prosecute."" Ms Allan said ""no-one is suggesting there are 1,000 victims on the streets of Telford today"". Ansar Ali, a spokesman for Together Against Grooming, said he had seen evidence about the background of those affected. He said: ""A study on this issue was done by the Office of the Children's Commissioner which dated back to 2013 and, according to that research, a third of victims were felt to be from a non-white background or black minority ethnic background."" A Telford social worker said they support girls and boys from all backgrounds. A Telford social worker, who did not wish to give her name, said: ""It isn't only girls that are exploited, boys can be exploited in exactly the same way through grooming. ""We work with an age range of  13 to 19-year-olds, we have females and we have males we support. ""We have young people from all different backgrounds, it is not just targeting young girls through working class."" White working class girls 'traded for sex' Telford grooming gangs 'tip of iceberg' 'I was sold twice a night' Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali (top row) The Sunday Mirror said it found ""groups of mainly Asian men"" were targeting girls in the town. Child sexual exploitation in Telford first made headlines in 2012 when seven men were jailed following West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Victims as young as 13 were plied with drugs and alcohol and sold for sex by men who posed as their boyfriends. Ms Allan said the men jailed in 2012 ""were of Pakistani origin, the victims were of white origin"" and ""that was the case in Rotherham and in other places across the country"". She said: ""We shouldn't shy away from it and we shouldn't bury our heads in the sand."" Supt Tom Harding said West Mercia Police ""know"" the scale of child sexual exploitation in Telford But Supt Harding disputed claims that offenders are predominantly groups of Asian men, adding: ""You look at Operation Chalice and that was a prosecution that happened to be a number of Asian males. ""What I would say is sexual offending across Telford and Wrekin is virtually identically proportionate to the break-down of society, so it is not one particular section over others and we will tackle it wherever it is."" Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, who said: ""It is self-evident that one of the reasons those kinds of horrific crimes were able to go on for such a long time is too many people in authority felt that they shouldn't say anything because they'd be labelled racist and that's completely unacceptable."" Supt Harding said: ""My officers will stop [and] engage with people for a variety of reasons and the race of that person does not enter their minds."" There are claims hundreds of children could have been abused in Telford over four decades Telford & Wrekin Council and West Mercia Police said they had invested huge resources into tacking CSE in the town. The council has a dedicated team which deals with young people at risk of sexual assault. Between 2013 and 2016 it dealt with 303 cases. A spokesman for the authority said: ""Our approach to CSE is now very different from 10 - 20 years ago. We have learned lots of lessons and made many changes to our practices, which we keep under constant review."" Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans of West Mercia Police said tackling the issue was ""the number one priority for police in Telford"". ""We have specialist officers and resources in place tackling this type of offending, and we are committed to using our resources and technology to pursue anyone who sexually offends against children - whether that offending took place today, last week or years ago,"" he added. The anonymous social worker said she did not believe agencies were ""complacent"" over the issue in Telford and have done large amounts with communities to make sure they are aware of the signs of exploitation. MP Lucy Allan said there needed to be an independent review into child sexual exploitation in Telford Ms Allan has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into what happened in Telford. ""We are going to be focussing on why did this happen,"" she has said. ""That's what the victims want, that's what they need."" She added: ""I want an inquiry to tell us why it has happened. ""Is someone responsible? Should we have done something differently?"" Council leader and Labour councillor Shaun Davies backed her plea and said his ""absolute commitment is to victims"". Telford & Wrekin Council leader Shaun Davies said he would be calling for the IICSA to visit Telford The Home Office said the government's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, set up in the wake of allegations about Jimmy Savile, would be heading to Telford, but it was for local authorities to decide whether a further review was necessary. Telford & Wrekin Council said: ""The council believes another council-commissioned inquiry is not appropriate as its independence and scope could be called into question, hence the need for the government to commission this."" It said if the Home Office would not commission a report, it would continue to push for the IICSA, chaired by Prof Alexis Jay, to visit Telford as soon as possible. Prof Jay headed theinquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, which was ordered by local authorities there in the wake of its own child abuse scandal.

"This video can not be played Rex Tillerson: ""I will now return to private life"" Sacked US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned of Russia's ""troubling behaviour and actions"" in a parting statement after being fired by President Donald Trump. He pointedly failed to thank Mr Trump or praise his policies. The former ExxonMobil chief had a series of public rifts with the White House after being appointed last year. Mr Trump officially fired Mr Tillerson via Twitter, naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. What Pompeo means for US foreign policy Where it went wrong for Rex Mr Trump also named Gina Haspel to become the CIA's first female director. Speaking to reporters at the Department of State, Mr Tillerson said good work had been done to have better relations with China, and rein in North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. This video can not be played From ""moron"" to ""castration"": a history of Trump v Tillerson bust-ups But he added: ""Much work remains to respond to the troubling behaviour and actions on the part of the Russian government. ""Russia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone's interest."" Sounding breathless and looking shaken, Mr Tillerson said he had spoken to the president to ensure clarity in the days ahead. Although Mr Tillerson will not officially leave until 31 March, his deputy John Sullivan will take over running the state department pending the confirmation of Mr Pompeo. ""What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges,"" Mr Tillerson said.

"Maira Figueroa is embraced by her mother as she regains her freedom A 34-year-old woman in El Salvador has been freed after spending 15 years in jail for having an abortion. Maira VerÃ³nica Figueroa MarroquÃ­n was released after her 30-year sentence for aggravated murder was reduced. Abortion is banned in El Salvador, a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, in any circumstances. Ms Figueroa always maintained her innocence. She said she suffered a stillbirth in a house where she was working as a maid in 2003. She was taken to hospital, arrested and eventually sentenced for inducing an abortion. Her parents, as well as journalists and activists, were outside the prison in Ilopango, near the capital San Salvador, to welcome her. ""I am happy to be with my family,"" she said. ""I want to study law to understand what happened to me and help other women,"" she added. Ms Figueroa has spent almost half of her life at the Ilopango Women's Rehabilitation Centre ""I'm going to start again and make up for lost time."" Ms Figueroa is the second woman this year to have her sentence for abortion reduced by the Supreme Court. Teodora VÃ¡squez, 35, had her sentenced commuteda month ago. She spent 10 years in jail after her baby was found dead and she was sentenced for murder. El Salvador is one of a handful of countries in the world where abortions are completely banned and carry heavy sentences. The punishment is up to eight years in jail but in many cases in which the foetus or newborn has died, the charge is changed to one of aggravated homicide, which carries a minimum sentence of 30 years. While El Salvador is not alone in Latin America in having a total ban on abortions, the country is particularly strict in the way it enforces it. Doctors have to inform the authorities if they think a woman has tried to end her pregnancy. If they fail to report such cases, they too could face long sentences in jail. Human rights groups say this results in a criminalisation of miscarriages and medical emergencies, with more than 100 convicted of abortion-related crimes in El Salvador since 2000.

"Annual tax rises of Â£40bn will be needed if the government wants to keep spending constant and balance its books by 2025, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies added that dismal productivity, earnings and GDP growth had become the ""new normal"". Its forecast comes after the chancellor unveiled upgraded growth and borrowing forecastsin the Spring Statement on Tuesday. Philip Hammond said the UK economy had reached a turning point. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said that""nothing much"" had changed,externalin the Spring Statement. He said the UK was still suffering the hangover of the 2008 financial crisis and its growth outlook was ""the worst in the G20"". He said the big problem facing the chancellor was how to balance growing demands for spending increases with his promise to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s. On the one hand, public services such as prisons and the NHS were struggling ""in a way that they were not two or three years ago"", Mr Johnson said. On the other, the government is struggling to collect as much tax as it used to, after taking large numbers of people out of paying income tax. ""The chancellor has been unable to tackle the problems posed by the increasing numbers of self-employed and company owner managers, who pay less tax than similarly remunerated employees,"" Mr Johnson added. ""If high-paid jobs - and EU citizens, who are well represented among high earners in the UK - relocate elsewhere, the consequences for the Exchequer will be severe,"" he added. Given the outlook, the IFS said tax rises of Â£30bn would be needed each year to retain public spending and balance the budget by the middle of the next decade - a Conservative Party pledge. An extra Â£11bn would be required to cover social care, health and pension costs for the ageing population, the IFS said. In the Spring Statement, Mr Hammond said growth was now forecast to be 1.5% in 2018, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November. He also said debt was expected to fall as a share of GDP from 2018-19, the first drop in 17 years, and that inflation would return to 2% by the end of the year. Growth is now forecast to be 1.5% in 2018, up from 1.4% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in November However, Mr Johnson said the good news on borrowing would ""largely wash out"" over the next few years, while the structural deficit in 2019-20 would be almost unchanged. He added that the UK economy was now 14% smaller than would have been expected, based on pre-crisis trends, while median earnings remained below their 2008 level. ""The reality of the economic and fiscal challenges facing us ought to be at the very top of the news agenda,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And I mean the reality, not the spin and bluster of politicians on all sides pretending there are easy solutions."" Commenting on the IFS's analysis, John McDonnell MP, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""Despite the chancellor's spin yesterday, the IFS has revealed that there may be Â£30bn of new tax rises and spending cuts to come. ""Under the Tories, it won't be the richest who are hit by these tax rises and austerity cuts, but the poorest - largely families and children - who will bear the brunt of their heartless economic plans."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our balanced approach has reduced the deficit while also cutting taxes for over 30 million people and investing in our vital public services.""

"Bradford, where race riots erupted 17 years ago, is one of the five places adopting the plan Five English councils are to adopt new integration plans to deal with problems of segregation. The government's Integrated Communities Strategy will see Â£50m invested in schemes to improve community relations over the next two years. Bradford, Blackburn, Peterborough, Walsall and Waltham Forest in London have been selected for special help. The plan includes schemes to encourage pupils to form lasting relationships with those from different backgrounds. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, launching a consultation paper on the plan, said Britain ""cannot ignore the fact that in too many parts of our country, communities are divided"". ""Successive governments have refused to deal with the integration challenges we face head on, preferring to let people muddle along and live isolated and separated lives,"" he said.

"This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond has given his clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending further on the NHS. The chancellor told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he recognised the pressures for more spending on health, local government ""and other areas"". He said he would like to use any ""headroom"" ahead of the autumn Budget to find more cash for public services. The NHS, he said, had got an extra Â£9bn since 2016 but an ageing society was creating ""continuous upward pressures"". The BBC understands the cabinet discussed earlier this year the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even the idea of a dedicated tax backed by some Conservative MPs. The BBC's political editor said she had been told by one cabinet minister that conversations were ""very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. UK economy at turning point - Hammond Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election As recently as last year's general election campaign, Theresa May maintained that the NHS had the money that it needed. But after coming under pressure from Labour and some of his own MPs, Mr Hammond found Â£2.8bn extra in November's Budget for the NHS in England spread over two years. However, the unions say this is just a sticking plaster after years of austerity and that the NHS, which is emerging from one of the toughest winters in recent years, needs a much larger cash injection. Pressed on the state of cabinet discussions, Mr Hammond said ministers were looking at spending needs ""across the piece"" ahead of the autumn Budget and a departmental spending review next year. ""Of course we recognise all these pressures,"" he said. ""It is not just the health service. There are pressures in local government and other areas but we have to do this in a balanced way"". ""We have put a lot more money into the NHS but of course we recognise the implications of an ageing society and an ageing population - not just for the health service but for our social care services as well."" In his Spring Statement, Mr Hammond announced no new spending commitments but said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" after eight years of spending restraint focused on reducing the deficit. In the update to MPs, he said the Office for Budget Responsibility's growth forecast for 2018 had been revised marginally upwards while the watchdog said it expected public borrowing to fall every year until 2021-22. Mr Hammond told the BBC he had already committed to an extra Â£11bn in public spending this year and all chancellors ""would like to have more money available to spend"". Why is the chancellor so upbeat? Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? But with debt as a share of GDP due to start falling and the UK soon no longer having to borrow to fund day-to-day spending, he hinted he may have more room for manoeuvre. ""I hope that the improvement in the public finances that was hinted at in today's OBR report, I hope that those will be carried through the autumn report and that will allow us to use some of that headroom at the autumn Budget to increase spending on our public services. ""Of course that is what I would like to do if the public finances allow it."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has accused Mr Hammond of ""ignoring"" the public services despite ""a crisis on a scale we have never seen before"". He said doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers and carers ""can't wait"" for the next Budget and wanted action after years of pay freezes and below inflation wage increases. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Mr Hammond faced a ""sharp choice"" on spending if he wanted to meet his target of eliminating the overall deficit, including capital expenditure, by the mid 2020s. Its director Paul Johnson suggested the economic backdrop was less rosy than Mr Hammond was suggesting, with growth forecasts for the next four years ""dreadful"" by historical standards.

"Tributes from around the scientific community are pouring in for prominent physicist Stephen Hawking, who died early on Wednesday aged 76. The messages highlight his breakthrough research as well as his personality and inspiration to millions. One of the world's best-loved scientists, he was renowned for his work on black holes and relativity. He wrote hugely popular science books, and even broke into a pop culture. Suffering from a rare form of motor neurone disease he spent most of his life in a wheelchair and was largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. US TV scientist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said Hawking's death left a huge vacuum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket, said annual profits jumped 11% as its turnaround programme continues. The chain made underlying pre-tax profits of Â£374m in the year to 4 February, Â£37m higher than in 2016. Like-for-like sales, which strip out stores open for less than a year, were 2.8% higher excluding fuel. The retailer said performance was strong despite the ""challenges"" of higher import costs. Revenues rose Â£1bn to Â£17.3bn and chairman Andrew Higginson said Morrisons was now entering its third consecutive year of growth. However, by the close of trading in London, its shares were 4.86% lower. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said there was a ""sense that this kind of growth will be difficult to maintain, but this has been the argument for some time and has continually been wrong"". Morrisons announced a special dividend of 4p per share, which the firm said reflected its good progress and expectations for continued growth. One of the chain's priorities is to become more competitive. At Christmas, it said a basket of key items was the same price as the same time last year despite higher costs. Last month, Morrisons announced it would cut 1,500 middle management jobs. Laith Khalaf, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said the supermarket's largely UK supply chain had helped to ""keep prices competitive, in a market where the falling pound has increased the cost of imported food"".

"Maira Figueroa is embraced by her mother as she regains her freedom A 34-year-old woman in El Salvador has been freed after spending 15 years in jail for having an abortion. Maira VerÃ³nica Figueroa MarroquÃ­n was released after her 30-year sentence for aggravated murder was reduced. Abortion is banned in El Salvador, a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, in any circumstances. Ms Figueroa always maintained her innocence. She said she suffered a stillbirth in a house where she was working as a maid in 2003. She was taken to hospital, arrested and eventually sentenced for inducing an abortion. Her parents, as well as journalists and activists, were outside the prison in Ilopango, near the capital San Salvador, to welcome her. ""I am happy to be with my family,"" she said. ""I want to study law to understand what happened to me and help other women,"" she added. Ms Figueroa has spent almost half of her life at the Ilopango Women's Rehabilitation Centre ""I'm going to start again and make up for lost time."" Ms Figueroa is the second woman this year to have her sentence for abortion reduced by the Supreme Court. Teodora VÃ¡squez, 35, had her sentenced commuteda month ago. She spent 10 years in jail after her baby was found dead and she was sentenced for murder. El Salvador is one of a handful of countries in the world where abortions are completely banned and carry heavy sentences. The punishment is up to eight years in jail but in many cases in which the foetus or newborn has died, the charge is changed to one of aggravated homicide, which carries a minimum sentence of 30 years. While El Salvador is not alone in Latin America in having a total ban on abortions, the country is particularly strict in the way it enforces it. Doctors have to inform the authorities if they think a woman has tried to end her pregnancy. If they fail to report such cases, they too could face long sentences in jail. Human rights groups say this results in a criminalisation of miscarriages and medical emergencies, with more than 100 convicted of abortion-related crimes in El Salvador since 2000.

"Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket, said annual profits jumped 11% as its turnaround programme continues. The chain made underlying pre-tax profits of Â£374m in the year to 4 February, Â£37m higher than in 2016. Like-for-like sales, which strip out stores open for less than a year, were 2.8% higher excluding fuel. The retailer said performance was strong despite the ""challenges"" of higher import costs. Revenues rose Â£1bn to Â£17.3bn and chairman Andrew Higginson said Morrisons was now entering its third consecutive year of growth. However, by the close of trading in London, its shares were 4.86% lower. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said there was a ""sense that this kind of growth will be difficult to maintain, but this has been the argument for some time and has continually been wrong"". Morrisons announced a special dividend of 4p per share, which the firm said reflected its good progress and expectations for continued growth. One of the chain's priorities is to become more competitive. At Christmas, it said a basket of key items was the same price as the same time last year despite higher costs. Last month, Morrisons announced it would cut 1,500 middle management jobs. Laith Khalaf, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said the supermarket's largely UK supply chain had helped to ""keep prices competitive, in a market where the falling pound has increased the cost of imported food"". Although margins had slipped slightly, he said rising sales had helped bolster the bottom line, with the higher profits attributed to lower borrowing costs. Mr Khalaf added: ""Morrisons is carving out a place in the winner's camp.

"This video can not be played Five things you may not have known about Prof Hawking World renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76. He died peacefully at his home in Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday, his family said. The British scientist was famed for his work with black holes and relativity, and wrote several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. At the age of 22Prof Hawkingwas given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. Obituary: Stephen Hawking A life in pictures Reaction to his death - latest updates The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. In a statement his children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: ""We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. ""He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years."" They praised his ""courage and persistence"" and said his ""brilliance and humour"" inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever."" A book of condolence has been opened at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge, where Prof Hawking was a fellow. This video can not be played Professor Brian Cox on the legacy and wonder of Hawking's work Prof Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics. He also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation. Stephen Hawking in quotes The discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous Tributes flood in for Stephen Hawking Science community mourns Stephen Hawking China's love for the late Stephen Hawking A brief history of Stephen Hawking's cameos Through his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated thatEinstein's general theory of relativityimplies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. The scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory. Allow Twitter content?

The comedian and presenter of the BBC's Stargazing Live Dara O'Briain said the scientist had an ""immeasurable life"" and ""one of the few people I would call a hero of mine"". Theoretical physicist, professor Jim Al-Khalili, from Surrey University said Prof Hawking had a tremendous sense of humour. He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""He was a fun loving guy. Inside that shell, inside that body that was paralysed, was someone who was full of vigour, full of passion for life."" With the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity Black holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon He predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy In the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this ""information"" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved British astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". Gian Giudice, head of theoretical physics at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, said Prof Hawking had a ""great impact"" on the centre's research, adding: ""A giant of our field has left us, but his immortal contributions will remain forever.""

"Stephen Hawking, who was born in 1942, studied physics in Oxford and later went on to Cambridge for his postgraduate research in cosmology. At the age of 22, he was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. As he was preparing to marry his first wife Jane (pictured), doctors predicted he did not have long to live. They were married for 26 years and went on to have three children together. He used a wheelchair and was largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. Hawking shot to fame with his 1988 book A Brief History of Time, which sold over 10 million copies. The physicist appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1992 with Sue Lawley. His chosen luxury was crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e Hawking later went on to marry one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They were married for 11 years before they divorced. In 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch became the first actor to portray the physicist on screen. The BBC TV film, Hawking, was critically acclaimed. The world-famous physicist often delivered lectures at universities around the world, like this one he gave at the George Washington University in 2008. Hawking met many famous world figures, including Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in 2008 He won many awards in the fields of mathematics and science and in 2009, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-US President Barack Obama. He also went on to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2014 during a charity event at St James' Palace. His life story was made into a 2014 film, The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne who is pictured here with Hawking. In 2017, Hawking spoke to an audience in Hong Kong by hologram, beamed live from his office in Cambridge. After his death, his children said his legacy would ""live on for many years"".

"This video can not be played Telford police chief 'not playing down child sex abuse' Reports on the scale of sexual abuse in Telford are ""sensationalised"", a police chief has said. The Sunday Mirror said it uncovered Britain's ""worst ever"" child grooming scandal,external, with up to 1,000 girls abused by grooming gangs since the 1980s. One victim told how she was abused at a ""rape house"" and the town's MP Lucy Allan said girls were being traded for sex in a ""routine way"". West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding ""significantly disputed"" the figures. ""I don't believe Telford is any worse than lots of places across England and Wales,"" he said. This video can not be played Telford abuse: 'I was sold twice a night' The Sunday Mirror said its report revealed ""abuse on unprecedented levels"". ""Holly"" - a victim of exploitation in the town from the age of 14 - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she went to a sexual health clinic for the morning-after pill twice a week for three years, but no-one ever asked her any questions. She said she was beaten with a belt and sold ""two or three times a night"". Ms Allan told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that white working class girls were targeted because of their backgrounds. This video can not be played White working class girls traded for sex, says MP But reports of the scale of the abuse, and the background of victims, have been questioned. Supt Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford, said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people"" who were victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) or considered ""at risk"".

He added: ""Therefore, I significantly dispute the 1,000 plus figure and do feel it is sensationalised. ""Read the headlines, read the reports. What are they actually discussing? They're discussing cases from 20 or 30 years ago, offending back in the 1990s. ""We've never said there aren't cases, there are always cases we are working on and seeking to prosecute."" Ms Allan said ""no-one is suggesting there are 1,000 victims on the streets of Telford today"". Ansar Ali, a spokesman for Together Against Grooming, said he had seen evidence about the background of those affected. He said: ""A study on this issue was done by the Office of the Children's Commissioner which dated back to 2013 and, according to that research, a third of victims were felt to be from a non-white background or black minority ethnic background."" A Telford social worker said they support girls and boys from all backgrounds. A Telford social worker, who did not wish to give her name, said: ""It isn't only girls that are exploited, boys can be exploited in exactly the same way through grooming. ""We work with an age range of  13 to 19-year-olds, we have females and we have males we support. ""We have young people from all different backgrounds, it is not just targeting young girls through working class."" White working class girls 'traded for sex' Telford grooming gangs 'tip of iceberg' 'I was sold twice a night' Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali (top row) The Sunday Mirror said it found ""groups of mainly Asian men"" were targeting girls in the town. Child sexual exploitation in Telford first made headlines in 2012 when seven men were jailed following West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Victims as young as 13 were plied with drugs and alcohol and sold for sex by men who posed as their boyfriends. Ms Allan said the men jailed in 2012 ""were of Pakistani origin, the victims were of white origin"" and ""that was the case in Rotherham and in other places across the country"". She said: ""We shouldn't shy away from it and we shouldn't bury our heads in the sand."" Supt Tom Harding said West Mercia Police ""know"" the scale of child sexual exploitation in Telford But Supt Harding disputed claims that offenders are predominantly groups of Asian men, adding: ""You look at Operation Chalice and that was a prosecution that happened to be a number of Asian males. ""What I would say is sexual offending across Telford and Wrekin is virtually identically proportionate to the break-down of society, so it is not one particular section over others and we will tackle it wherever it is."" Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, who said: ""It is self-evident that one of the reasons those kinds of horrific crimes were able to go on for such a long time is too many people in authority felt that they shouldn't say anything because they'd be labelled racist and that's completely unacceptable."" Supt Harding said: ""My officers will stop [and] engage with people for a variety of reasons and the race of that person does not enter their minds."" There are claims hundreds of children could have been abused in Telford over four decades Telford & Wrekin Council and West Mercia Police said they had invested huge resources into tacking CSE in the town. The council has a dedicated team which deals with young people at risk of sexual assault. Between 2013 and 2016 it dealt with 303 cases. A spokesman for the authority said: ""Our approach to CSE is now very different from 10 - 20 years ago. We have learned lots of lessons and made many changes to our practices, which we keep under constant review."" Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans of West Mercia Police said tackling the issue was ""the number one priority for police in Telford"". ""We have specialist officers and resources in place tackling this type of offending, and we are committed to using our resources and technology to pursue anyone who sexually offends against children - whether that offending took place today, last week or years ago,"" he added. The anonymous social worker said she did not believe agencies were ""complacent"" over the issue in Telford and have done large amounts with communities to make sure they are aware of the signs of exploitation. MP Lucy Allan said there needed to be an independent review into child sexual exploitation in Telford Ms Allan has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into what happened in Telford. ""We are going to be focussing on why did this happen,"" she has said. ""That's what the victims want, that's what they need."" She added: ""I want an inquiry to tell us why it has happened. ""Is someone responsible? Should we have done something differently?"" Council leader and Labour councillor Shaun Davies backed her plea and said his ""absolute commitment is to victims"". Telford & Wrekin Council leader Shaun Davies said he would be calling for the IICSA to visit Telford The Home Office said the government's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, set up in the wake of allegations about Jimmy Savile, would be heading to Telford, but it was for local authorities to decide whether a further review was necessary. Telford & Wrekin Council said: ""The council believes another council-commissioned inquiry is not appropriate as its independence and scope could be called into question, hence the need for the government to commission this."" It said if the Home Office would not commission a report, it would continue to push for the IICSA, chaired by Prof Alexis Jay, to visit Telford as soon as possible. Prof Jay headed theinquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, which was ordered by local authorities there in the wake of its own child abuse scandal.

"This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Philip Hammond Philip Hammond has given his clearest hint yet that he is prepared to increase spending further on the NHS. The chancellor told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he recognised the pressures for more spending on health, local government ""and other areas"". He said he would like to use any ""headroom"" ahead of the autumn Budget to find more cash for public services. The NHS, he said, had got an extra Â£9bn since 2016 but an ageing society was creating ""continuous upward pressures"". The BBC understands the cabinet discussed earlier this year the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even the idea of a dedicated tax backed by some Conservative MPs. The BBC's political editor said she had been told by one cabinet minister that conversations were ""very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. UK economy at turning point - Hammond Kuenssberg: Hammond looks to next election As recently as last year's general election campaign, Theresa May maintained that the NHS had the money that it needed. But after coming under pressure from Labour and some of his own MPs, Mr Hammond found Â£2.8bn extra in November's Budget for the NHS in England spread over two years. However, the unions say this is just a sticking plaster after years of austerity and that the NHS, which is emerging from one of the toughest winters in recent years, needs a much larger cash injection. Pressed on the state of cabinet discussions, Mr Hammond said ministers were looking at spending needs ""across the piece"" ahead of the autumn Budget and a departmental spending review next year. ""Of course we recognise all these pressures,"" he said. ""It is not just the health service. There are pressures in local government and other areas but we have to do this in a balanced way"". ""We have put a lot more money into the NHS but of course we recognise the implications of an ageing society and an ageing population - not just for the health service but for our social care services as well."" In his Spring Statement, Mr Hammond announced no new spending commitments but said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" after eight years of spending restraint focused on reducing the deficit. In the update to MPs, he said the Office for Budget Responsibility's growth forecast for 2018 had been revised marginally upwards while the watchdog said it expected public borrowing to fall every year until 2021-22. Mr Hammond told the BBC he had already committed to an extra Â£11bn in public spending this year and all chancellors ""would like to have more money available to spend"". Why is the chancellor so upbeat? Reality Check: Is the chancellor right that debt is shrinking? But with debt as a share of GDP due to start falling and the UK soon no longer having to borrow to fund day-to-day spending, he hinted he may have more room for manoeuvre. ""I hope that the improvement in the public finances that was hinted at in today's OBR report, I hope that those will be carried through the autumn report and that will allow us to use some of that headroom at the autumn Budget to increase spending on our public services. ""Of course that is what I would like to do if the public finances allow it."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has accused Mr Hammond of ""ignoring"" the public services despite ""a crisis on a scale we have never seen before"". He said doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers and carers ""can't wait"" for the next Budget and wanted action after years of pay freezes and below inflation wage increases. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Mr Hammond faced a ""sharp choice"" on spending if he wanted to meet his target of eliminating the overall deficit, including capital expenditure, by the mid 2020s. Its director Paul Johnson suggested the economic backdrop was less rosy than Mr Hammond was suggesting, with growth forecasts for the next four years ""dreadful"" by historical standards.

"About one in three NHS clinics and one in four private ones offering breast implant surgery in England have not submitted any patient data to a national safety registry. NHS Digital set up the service in 2016 after the PIP (Poly Implant Prothese) breast implants scandal. Poor record-keeping at the time of the scandal meant many of the thousands of women affected were unable to find out if they had been given faulty implants. The register,externalis non-compulsory. Women in England who have had breast implant surgery are being urged to make sure their details are added to the Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry so that they can be easily traced if something were to go wrong with any brand of implant. PIP breast implants were withdrawn from the UK in 2010 after it was found they had been fraudulently made in France with unapproved silicone gel and were far more prone to splitting and leakage than other breast implants. It's estimated about 47,000 British women had PIP implants fitted, and most are still living with them. A UK report in June 2012 concluded the implants had double the rupture rate of other implants, but were not found to be toxic or carcinogenic (cancer-causing). Setting up the Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry was one of the recommendations of that report, by Sir Bruce Keogh. As at the end of January 2018, 231 providers had submitted data to the registry for 12,301 patients - 38% of the submissions were from NHS providers and 62% were from the independent sector. But 39% of NHS providers and 24% of independent providers in England had not yet submitted data for the patients they had treated since the register was launched in October 2016. All providers of breast implant surgery are expected to offer this service to their patients. Patients need to sign a consent form to join the secure, confidential register. It is not clear if patients treated by certain providers refused consent or were simply not asked. The register logs: NHS number family name first name postcode date of birth surgeon's details details of the surgical procedure details of the implant used any repeat operations needed related to the implant Patients who had surgery before October 2016 can still be included as long as their provider remains in business and retains their notes. Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""It's vital that patients undergoing breast implant procedures encourage their surgeons to record their details on the registry, to safeguard their health. ""The confidential record allows patients to be contacted if their safety is at risk and will hopefully give people the confidence they need when making decisions on surgery."" Rajiv Grover, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said it was quick and simple for health professionals to register their patients' records. And he hoped more women would be happy to join the register. ""The PIP scandal underlines the importance of having a national register,"" he said. ""Had there been one at the time, tracing the people who might need to be assessed and treated would have been much easier.""

"Stephen Hawking - who died aged 76 - battled motor neurone disease to become one of the most respected and best-known scientists of his age. A man of great humour, he became a popular ambassador for science and was always careful to ensure that the general public had ready access to his work. His book A Brief History of Time became an unlikely best-seller although it is unclear how many people actually managed to get to the end of it. He appeared in a number of popular TV shows and lent his synthesised voice to various recordings. Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford on 8 January 1942. His father, a research biologist, had moved with his mother from London to escape German bombing. Hawking grew up in London and St Albans and, after gaining a first-class degree in physics from Oxford, went on to Cambridge for postgraduate research in cosmology. A life in pictures Stephen Hawking in quotes Science community mourns Stephen Hawking Trump stance could damage Earth - Hawking As a teenager he had enjoyed horse-riding and rowing but while at Cambridge he was diagnosed with a form of motor neurone disease which was to leave him almost completely paralysed. As he was preparing to marry his first wife, Jane, in 1964 his doctors gave him no more than two or three years of life. But the disease progressed more slowly than expected. The couple had three children, and in 1988 - although Hawking was by now only able to speak with a voice synthesiser following a tracheotomy - he had completed A Brief History of Time - a layman's guide to cosmology. It sold more than 10 million copies, although its author was aware that it was dubbed ""the most popular book never read"". He received honorary degrees, medals, prizes and awards throughout his career and was honoured with a CBE in 1982. He was reportedly offered a knighthood in the 1990s but later revealed he had turned it down over issues with the government's funding for science. This video can not be played Scientist in the public eye Hawking discovered the phenomenon which became known as Hawking radiation, where black holes leak energy and fade to nothing. He was renowned for his extraordinary capacity to visualise scientific solutions without calculation or experiment. But it was perhaps his ""theory of everything"", suggesting that the universe evolves according to well-defined laws, that attracted most attention. ""This complete set of laws can give us the answers to questions like how did the universe begin,"" he said. ""Where is it going and will it have an end? If so, how will it end? If we find the answers to these questions, we really shall know the mind of God."" He believed the universe evolves according to well-defined laws Hawking's celebrity status was acknowledged even by The Simpsons - he was depicted drinking at a bar with Homer, suggesting he might steal Homer's idea that the universe is shaped like a doughnut. He appeared in a special documentary about BBC comedy series Red Dwarf during which he spoke about why he enjoyed the show and also starred in Star Trek: The Next Generation as a hologram of his image. The rock group Pink Floyd used his distinctive synthesised voice for the introduction to Keep Talking, on their 1994 album The Division Bell. Undeterred by his condition, he continued his work as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, and in 2001, his second book - Universe in a Nutshell - was published. He believed his illness brought some benefits; he said before he developed the disease he had been bored with life. But his condition inevitably made him dependent on others. He often paid tribute to his wife, who had looked after him for more than 20 years, and friends and relatives were shocked when he left her for one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, whom he married in 1995. The couple later divorced in 2006. Hawking later went on to marry one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They were married for 11 years before they divorced By 2000, Hawking was a frequent visitor to the emergency department of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, seeking treatment for a variety of injuries. Police questioned several people about allegations that he had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse over a period of years. He was known to be an erratic, almost reckless driver of his electric wheelchair, and Hawking insisted his injuries were not caused by abuse. No action was taken. In 2007, he became the first quadriplegic to experience weightlessness on board the so-called ""vomit comet"", a modified plane specially designed to simulate zero gravity. He said he did it to encourage interest in space travel and booked a seat on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic sub-orbital space plane. ""I believe that life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, or other dangers. I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."" Eddie Redmayne played Hawking in The Theory of Everything In 2014, the film The Theory of Everything was released, based on Jane Hawking's account of their courtship and marriage. Hawking himself met Eddie Redmayne as part of the actor's preparation for taking on the role of the scientist. In a series for the Discovery Channel, he said it was perfectly rational to assume there was intelligent life elsewhere but warned that aliens might just raid earth of its resources and then move on. Hawking also predicted the end of humanity from global warming, a large comet or a new virus. He collaborated with Russian investor Yuri Milner in 2015 to work on projects to find evidence of alien life. He once wrote that he had motor neurone disease for practically all his adult life but said that it had not stopped him having an attractive family and being successful in his work. ""It shows,"" he said, ""that one need not lose hope."" . Stephen Hawking' s official website fan website Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Theresa May is set to announce a series of measures against Russia after it failed to meet her midnight deadline to explain how a nerve agent was used to poison a former double agent in the UK. Russia insisted it had ""no motive"" in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The Kremlin said any steps by the PM would lead to ""retaliatory measures"". Mrs May will be briefed by senior intelligence chiefs in Downing Street ahead of giving an update to MPs later. She will make a statement to the House of Commons after midday's Prime Minister's Questions. Measures could involve the expulsion of Russian diplomats, financial sanctions against wealthy Russians with links to the Kremlin, possible curbs on the Russian-funded TV station RT, or boycotting the Fifa World Cup in Russia later this year. What we know so far What are Novichok nerve agents? The spy at centre of poison mystery Russia retaliation could hurt UK business Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Britain of ""playing politics"" and ignoring an international agreement on chemical weapons. He said Moscow would co-operate if it received a formal request for clarification from the UK under theChemical Weapons Convention,external, which sets a 10-day time limit for a response. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""inevitable"" that Mrs May would choose to expel Russian diplomats, adding: ""To be honest, it's not that effective"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have to hit them hard where we can, and that's in the pocket"". This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" Former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan said a response should involve ""hitting the economic targets"" - particularly Russian individuals with assets in London. He told Today that UK needed to show Russia ""the consequences of being a rogue nation"". Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said EU leaders would discuss the poisoning at its meeting next week, adding that the incident showed the need for ""transatlantic unity"". The prime minister has also received the backing of US President Donald Trump, Downing Street said, who agreed in a phone call that Moscow ""must provide unambiguous answers as to how this nerve agent came to be used"". France's President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have also condemned the attack and offered support to the UK, as well as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - the Baltic states bordering Russia, No 10 said. Police continued to work on Tuesday evening near to where the Skripals were found collapsed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said if the attack was shown to be a ""direct act"" by the Russian state it would be a ""clear violation of the chemical weapons convention, a breach of international law and a threat to those who abide by the rules-based international order"". The Foreign Office is set to brief a session of the North Atlantic Council - Nato's political decision-making body - on the Skripal incident later. Both before and after the deadline had passed, Russia's UK embassyposted a series of tweets,externalsaying it would not issue a response without being given access to samples of the nerve agent. It also contended international obligations required a joint investigation take place into the incident. Another tweet said it had sought an ""explanation"" from the Foreign Office, amid speculation the UK could mount a cyber-attack, as it ""takes a serious view on cyber security breaches"". Moscow has already threatened to expel British media outlets from Russia if the Kremlin-funded TV channel RT is stripped of its licence to broadcast in the UK. Britain could expel Russian diplomats, as it did after the poisoning of former Russian Federal Security Service operative Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 with radioactive polonium. But the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says many argue that this, and the other measures that were taken after that killing, did not go far enough, and therefore the Skripal response is likely to be much more robust. So what else could the UK do? Other possible actions could include: Freezing financial assets Bans on visas Boycotting the Fifa World Cup in Russia later this year Taking Russian broadcasters such as RT (formerly Russia Today) off the air in the UK The actions announced on Wednesday are expected to be those that can be taken unilaterally by the UK - anything co-ordinated with other nations is likely to come later. Read more on how the UK could retaliate Mr Skripaland his daughter are critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a park bench in the centre of Salisbury on 4 March. Mrs May has said a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia - part ofa group of nerve agents known as Novichok- was used on the pair andit was therefore ""highly likely"" Russia was involved in the attack. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill responding to the incident, is in a serious but stable condition, and is thought to be improving. Thirty-five other people had been seen in hospital, of whom 34 had been assessed and discharged, while the condition of one person is being monitored as an outpatient. Police are appealing for anyone who saw the Skripals in their Red BMW car - registration plate HD09 WAO - between 13:00 and 13.45 GMT on the day of the poisoning. The car was left in Sainsbury's upper level car park in the Maltings shopping area before the pair went to the Bishops Mill Pub and then the restaurant Zizzi. Up to 14 other deaths to be re-examined for Russian links No change to England World Cup plans Police confirmed that Mr Skripal, who came to the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"" after he had been convicted by Russia of passing information to MI6, is a British citizen. Meanwhile, it was revealed thatUK counter-terror police are leading an investigation into the ""unexplained"" death of another Russian exile, believed to be Nikolai Glushkov. Officers say there is no evidence linking the death to the Salisbury attack.

"This video can not be played Victim: I will do whatever it takes to keep Worboys behind bars The Parole Board failed to consider ""critical evidence"" against rapist John Worboys before approving his prison release, a lawyer for two of his victims has told the High Court. The lawyer said the evidence related to ""wider allegations"" of sexual attacks. Police believe that Worboys - jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London - had more than 100 victims. Lawyer Phillippa Kaufmann QC said the board was wrong to decide Worboys took ""full responsibility"" for his crimes. Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital between 2002 and 2008. The 60-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, is watching the trial via video link from prison. The court heard he denies any allegation other than the offences he was convicted of. Legal papers submitted to the High Court show that as recently as September last year, the prison authorities believed he posed such a risk that he needed to remain in a Category A prison. Three months later the Parole Board decided that he should be let out with stringent licence conditions, without having been assessed at a less secure prison. Ms Kaufmann said this ""highly exceptional step"" was ""in the face of opposition"" from senior prison managers, prison psychologists, the probation service and the justice secretary. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Ms Kaufmann said the claims of Worboys' further crimes ""completely undermined"" the board's decision. She told the court: ""It is obvious, absolutely obvious, that this evidence of wider offending had a central bearing on all of those conclusions that formed the basis of the Parole Board's conclusion that there had been a reduction in risk."" Ms Kaufmann added it would have been fair to consider these allegations as the board did not have to determine whether he had actually committed the crimes. She said it would be ""extraordinary"" to release Worboys straight from a Category A prison, the highest security prison, into the community. At last, the cloak of secrecy surrounding the Parole Board's decision-making in this case has been lifted. Thanks to the judicial review challenge the public, and John Worboys' victims, can find out why the Board ruled it was safe to release him. Its decision was apparently influenced by assessments from three independent psychologists all of whom at some stage had been instructed by Worboys. One expert initially recommended he be moved from HMP Wakefield, a high security jail, to an 'open' prison, which allows inmates more freedom. That's the usual route to eventual release, taken by those serving life or indeterminate sentences. It enables the authorities to test whether prisoners can be trusted in a less secure environment where they're allowed to spend time working in the community. But the psychologist later changed their view and agreed with two other psychologists that the 60-year-old sex offender should be let out straight away - direct from Wakefield jail. To be released from a Category A prison, the court heard, is ""very unusual"".  Nevertheless,  their advice was accepted by the three-member parole panel, resulting in this landmark legal challenge. Ahead of the High Court challenge against the decision to grant him parole, victims said they were not properly informed and warned of risks to women's safety. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also launched a judicial review against the action to free the former black-cab driver. During the High Court challenge, three judges are hearing evidence over two days from victims and Mr Khan. As the case got under way, Mr Khan said in a statement that Worboys presented a ""significant threat"" to safety. He said: ""I have been clear that he shouldn't be released at the very least until the decision has been properly independently scrutinised and we are reassured that those in positions of power and responsibility are doing everything they can to keep all his victims, and the rest of us, safe."" The Sun newspaper is also part of the legal challenge, after it was granted permission last month to challenge the Parole Board over not publishing its decision. The Parole Boardhas previously apologised to victimswho were not told about the decision but said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not re-offend. The case continues.

"BP holds a 20% stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft A crackdown on Russia's UK business ties in the wake of the spy poison revelations will hit a complex and lucrative web of interests. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised measures against Moscow if there is no adequate explanation for the poisoning. But she would be pushing against interests that touch UK football, members of the House of Lords, and valuable assets owned by UK companies. Those assets include BP's 20% stake in Russian oil and gas giant Rosneft. That's worth repeating - a FTSE 100 company owns a fifth of Russia's most valuable company, which is state controlled. BP's chief executive Bob Dudley sits on a board that is chaired by close Putin-associate Igor Sechin. So far, the two companies have managed to find a way to carry on business despite sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea. Mr Dudley often has to leave the room during board meetings when matters pertaining personally to Mr Sechin arise as he is on a list of sanctioned persons. If sanctions get tougher - how will BP manage an asset that provides a third of its global oil production? So far the stock market has not moved to apply a discount to BP's holding, and sources close to the company have said they hope that any sanctions would target individuals rather than important foreign assets. But if the gloves really come off, what action would Russia take? A former executive of a telecoms company with a Russian subsidiary told me just how difficult Russia can make life. After the invasion of Crimea, Russia told the company to change all the phone numbers in Crimea to give them a Russian rather than Ukrainian prefix. Failure to do so would result in their licence to operate being suspended. Russia demands evidence of UK spy poison How could the UK retaliate against Russia? The London Stock Exchange recently accepted a listing from EN+, a metals company controlled by Oleg Deripaska, who you may remember was courted by both Lord Mandelson and former Chancellor George Osborne aboard his yacht. Now Mr Deripaska is not on the sanctioned persons list but -as I reported in November last year- the proceeds of the London share sale were used to pay down his debt to sanctioned Russian bank VTB. Russian interests are tied up with Chelsea and Arsenal football clubs The ties go deeper. Greg (Lord) Barker, former Energy Minister under David Cameron, is the non-executive chairman of EN+. There is nothing illegal or sanctions-busting in that, but it serves an illustrative tip of the iceberg of the huge amounts of work that UK advisers, lawyers and bankers derive from advising Russian customers located here and in Russia. Messrs Usmanov and Abramovich have taken a chunk of the hallowed turf of the Emirates (Arsenal) and Stamford Bridge (Chelsea) and have operated perfectly legally here. But both are on good terms with Vladimir Putin. If the way to hurt Putin is to hurt his friends, how far is the UK prepared to go? Is it ready to send a message that Russian money and business is not welcome in the UK just as Brexit looms. After expelling diplomats, one way for the UK to retaliate is to target Russian's huge UK property holdings. The Criminal Finance Act could be used to look more deeply into how the money used to buy premium London property was acquired. It is unlikely there will be widespread sympathy for the estate agents who make their money flogging penthouses to oligarchs, but Russian business has become an important fact of UK public life and the government may find it hard to target any new sanctions precisely enough not to deter valuable, legal business. There are other options - such as boycotting football's World Cup - but how many other countries would follow suit? Europe is also much more dependent on supplies of Russian gas than the UK. With Donald Trump pursuing a protectionist trade policy and with his hands full in North Korea, Theresa May's biggest test may be the amount of international support she can command.

"The Treasury could be paving the way for the end of 1p and 2p coins as it seeks views on the future of cash. It is inviting comments on the mix of coins in circulation as consumers move to non-cash payments such as contactless and digital spending. Ministers say there are no current plans to scrap them. But the consultation hints at the growing cost of handling these coins. It also questions the validity of the Â£50 note. Many countries - including Canada, the home of the current Bank of England governor Mark Carney - have ditched their low denomination coins. Australia, Brazil, and Sweden are among many others to do so. The document points to surveys that suggest six in 10 of UK 1p and 2p coins are only used once before being saved in a jar or discarded. In one in 12 of these cases, the coins are thrown in the bin. ""From an economic perspective, having large numbers of denominations that are not in demand, saved by the public, or in long-term storage at cash processors rather than used in circulation does not contribute to an efficient or cost effective cash cycle,"" theTreasury consultation document,externalsays. Pretty penny: considerable sum of money Penny dropped: something was finally understood Penny-dreadful: a cheap, often lurid, book or magazine Penny-pinching: miserly Penny-wise: Careful and thrifty in small matters Source: Collins English Dictionary Penny chews are generally more expensive nowadays Previously, the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce more than 500 million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation. However, the coins are now being used less often and being held in greater numbers by coin processing businesses, as consumers move to non-cash payments. The penny coin: Should we follow Ireland and phase it out? Carney calls for crackdown on crypto-currency 'mania' The value of the 1p coin has also been reduced by inflation so, in effect, the 1p coin is now worth less than the halfpenny when it was abolished in 1984. The 1p coin is legal tender for amounts up to 20p, so it is not permitted to pay debts with a sack full of pennies. The document also questions the need for the Â£50 note, which it suggests is rarely used for purchases. However, there is significant demand from overseas for these notes, where they are saved alongside dollars and euros. ""There is also a perception among some that Â£50 notes are used for money laundering, hidden economy activity, and tax evasion,"" it says. Despite seeking views on the future of cash, the Treasury says that coins still have a vital future in the UK. Research suggests that 2.7 million people in the UK are entirely reliant on cash. ""The government is committed to ensuring that the public's cash needs continue to be met,"" the document says. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit?
