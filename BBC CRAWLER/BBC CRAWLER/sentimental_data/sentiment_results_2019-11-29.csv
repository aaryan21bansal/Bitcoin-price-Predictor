"One of the victims of Friday's attack is named as Jack Merritt, a Cambridge graduate The condition of one of the victims in hospital has improved from critical to stable A woman was also killed. Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner.

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? Two members of the public have died and another three people were injured in a stabbing attack at London Bridge, the Met Police's commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told a press conference the stabbing attack, which has been declared a terrorist incident, began at an event at Fishmonger's Hall. Within five minutes of being called officers confronted the suspect - who was shot dead by police - she said. The suspect was wearing what is thought to have been a hoax explosive device. He was a former prisoner and convicted of a terrorist offence, sources have told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to people who were inside Fishmonger's Hall, where a criminal justice event was taking place. Dozens of people were in attendance, including students from Cambridge University and former prisoners. The university said it was ""gravely concerned"" about reports of its students and staff being caught up in the attack and was urgently seeking further information. Ms Dick said police were working at ""full tilt"" to understand what had happened and whether anyone else was involved. Officers were still working to identify the dead, she said. Of the injured people, one is critical but stable, a second is stable and a third has less serious injuries, the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens said. Details of what happened are still emerging, but videos on social media appear to show passers-by holding down the suspect on London Bridge. Another man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. Footage then shows an officer arriving, seeming to indicate to the group to move, and firing a shot. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". She added: ""Ours is a great city because we embrace each other's differences. ""We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed.""

At the start of this month, the UK threat level was lowered from severe to substantial - reflecting an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack was likely rather than highly likely because of a relative decline in activity. The challenge for police and security services is that low-tech attacks - involving knives or vehicles - and often carried out by lone actors can be hard to spot in advance since they involve relatively little preparation and communication. But in the wake of previous incidents in both the UK and other countries, police have been prepared for this kind of incident and seem to have been fast to intervene, taking few chances, although members of the public were also involved in restraining the individual. The priority for police and MI5 now will be establishing the identity of the individual, whether he had any links or associations and whether there is any ongoing related threat. Earlier, Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the suspect was wearing what is believed to be a hoax explosive device. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said attackers wear fake suicide vests for a couple of reasons: To add to public panic and in some cases to ensure police shoot them dead. To some attackers, martyrdom is preferable to capture, trial and spending many years in prison, our correspondent added. Police have said cordons will remain in place and extra police patrols will be held across the capital. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to Downing Street from his constituency, will convene a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee at 21:30. He said the emergency services and members of the public who intervened ""represent the very best of our country"". ""This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack and our values, our British values, will prevail,"" Mr Johnson added. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our country will never be divided or intimidated...our values will prevail"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan thanked the members of the public who showed ""breathtaking heroism"" in running towards danger - ""not knowing what confronted them"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it has begun a mandatory investigation into the shooting. London Bridge station and Tube has now reopened after it was earlier closed, Network Rail said. But trains may continue to be delayed, cancelled or revised while services are reinstated, it added. Both the Conservatives and Labour say they have suspended election campaigning for the night following the attack. This video can not be played Einar Orn was on his lunch break when suddenly he saw police cars and heard gunshots Witnesses have spoken to the BBC about what they saw. Amanda Hunter, who was on a bus on London Bridge at the time, said: ""All of a sudden [it] stopped and there was some commotion and I looked out the window and I just saw these three police officers going over to a manâ¦ ""It seemed like there was something in his hand, I'm not 100% sure. But then one of the police officers shot him."" Bus driver Mustafa Salih, 62, was travelling from Borough High Street towards London Bridge where he saw emergency vehicles and the police cordon. He told BBC London: ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get off and run'. ""I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. ""One woman was crying. I ran back down to Borough High Street. It was all very scary as we did not know what was happening."" More from witnesses at the scene London Bridge was the scene of another attack, on 3 June 2017, in which eight people were killed and many more injured. This latest attack comes after the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. London Bridge attack: Witness describes scene.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? The man who carried out the stab attack at London Bridge on Friday,named by police as Usman Khan,external, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, 28, was wearing a GPS police tag and was out of prison on licence when he launched his attack, in which a man and a woman were killed and three others were injured. Khan was shot dead by officers after members of the public restrained him. The Queen said she was ""saddened"" by the attack. She thanked the emergency services ""as well as the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others"". Police declared the attack a terrorist incident. LIVE: Investigations continue after London Bridge attack 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker What we know about the London Bridge attacker Khan was known to the authorities,having been convicted for terrorism offences in 2012. He was released from prison on licence in December 2018, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. The Parole Board said it had no involvement in the 28-year-old's release, saying he ""appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law)"". After leaving prison he had moved into a Stafford property on the ""approved premises"" list. The attack began at 13:58 GMT on Friday at Fishmongers' Hall, at the north end of London Bridge, at a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation. The Learning Together scheme, whichfeatured in the BBC's Law in Action programmeearlier this year, allows university students and prisoners to study alongside each other. Khan had been one of dozens of people at the event. Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 Mr Basu said the attack is understood to have started inside the building, before continuing onto London Bridge itself, where Khan was shot by armed officers. Police are carrying out a search, believed to be linked to the attack, at flats in Stafford, close to the town centre. Staffordshire Police's Deputy Ch Con, Nick Baker, said it was ""vitally important everyone remains alert but not alarmed"". Mr Basu added police were not actively seeking anyone else in relation to the attack, although they were making ""fast time enquiries"" to make sure there was no outstanding threat to the public. A cordoned-off area around London Bridge Forensic officers at the scene on London Bridge The Met Police is urging anyone with information - particularly anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall - to contact them. Ben Perrin, BBC News Online Staffordshire Police searched flats in Stafford There is a general feeling of shock and disbelief here in Stafford, where a top floor flat is being searched. Blue screens and forensic tents are outside the front of the semi-detached property within a 50m police cordon. I've seen evidence bags being taken out of the house and the garden also appears to be part of the search. The property is believed to be privately-owned and used, in part, as a halfway house. Local residents have told me it has a high turnover of tenants and Khan had only been living there for about six months. A man and a woman were killed during the attack. Three others - a man and two women - were also injured and remain in hospital. NHS chief Simon Stevens said, on Friday, that one person was in a critical but stable condition, another was stable and the third had less serious injuries. None of those killed or injured has so far been named and officers were still working to identify those who died, Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Friday. Police believe the attacker had acted alone, the commissioner added on Saturday. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". Videos posted on social media appeared to show passers-by holding Khan down, while a man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. One witness described,externalhow a man at the event at Fishmongers' Hall grabbed a narwhal tusk - a long white horn that protrudes from the whale - that was on the wall, and went outside to confront the attacker. Another person let off a fire extinguisher in the face of the attacker to try to keep him at bay. This video can not be played Tour guide Stevie Hurst told 5 Live he kicked the suspect in the head One of those who rushed to help during the attack was a convicted murderer who was attending the prisoner rehabilitation event on day release, the Times reported. James Ford, 42,was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years in 2004 for the murder of Amanda Champion,external, a 21-year-old woman with learning difficulties. PM to appear on Marr after London attack 'Get off and run': Witnesses describe the scene London Bridge: What we know so far Mr Basu said Khan was wearing what was believed to be a hoax explosive device. The prime minister put election campaigning on hold on Friday to hold a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Mr Johnson visited the scene at London Bridge on Saturday with Met Commissioner Ms Dick and Home Secretary Priti Patel. He praised the ""incredible"" response by members of the emergency services and the ""sheer bravery"" of members of the public who intervened. Mr Johnson said his ""immediate takeaway"" from the attack was to""toughen up sentences"" for serious and violent offences. ""When people are sentenced to a certain number of years in prison, they should serve every year of that sentence,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the scene on Saturday alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick and Home Secretary Priti Patel London Mayor Sadiq Khan he was ""in awe of the bravery, the courageousness of ordinary Londoners"" who stopped the attacker. He told BBC Breakfast there would be an increased presence of armed and unarmed police officers in London over the weekend, adding they were there to ""reassure us - not because there is an additional or heightened threat"". The London mayor also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had to make sure the ""right lessons"" were learned from the attack. ""You can't disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation - the tools that judges have,"" he said. But security minister Brandon Lewis told the programme funding for counter-terrorism policing had consistently increased since 2015. ""We will make sure that the police has got the resource that it needs,"" he added. This video can not be played The prime minister says the system that allowed the killer out on early release ""does not make sense"" Political parties cancelled some events on Saturday, which had been planned ahead of the general election on 12 December. Flags on UK government buildings will fly at half-mast on Saturday as a mark of respect to all those affected by the attack. The Queen said in a statement: ""Prince Philip and I have been saddened to hear of the terror attacks at London Bridge. ""We send our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by yesterday's terrible violence."" This video can not be played Einar Orn was on his lunch break when suddenly he saw police cars and heard gunshots London Bridge was the scene of another attack, on 3 June 2017, in which eight people were killed and many more injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said Friday's events had brought back memories of the 2017 attack. ""It's only two-and-a-half years since the June attack and that's not long for healing, and actually it feels as though wounds have been reopened,"" he said. ""Where people felt they had come to terms with what had happened in their community, now I think they're wondering whether they really had - so a lot of work for us to do,"" he added. This latest attack comes afterthe UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"",meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. Some of the early debate about the London Bridge attack has focused on the sentence imposed on Usman Khan. The sentencing judge thought Khan should be freed from prison only when it was safe to do so, as part ""indeterminate penalty"" scheme (IPP). But the Court Of Appeal replaced Khan's IPP with an extended sentence, which required his release at the halfway point of his 16-year custodial term. The IPP regime was scrapped in 2012  - a decision that was widely supported at the time. Since Khan's conviction, legislation has been put in place for the Parole Board to determine when offenders on extended sentences should be let out. The attack also raises questions about the extent to which people convicted of terrorism offences can be de-radicalised. Khan was one of 51 inmates with terror links let out of jail in the 12 months to the end of March 2019, so it's inevitable that the role of those monitoring him will now be scrutinised. Did the authorities pick up any warning signs about Khan? Was he meeting people he shouldn't have done or plotting the attack? If no signs were detected, why not? And if the authorities did spot concerns, what did they do? Friday's horrific attack was the second fatal stabbing at an offender rehabilitation event this month, after Hakim Sillah died at a knife awareness course in Hillingdon, west London. These events will likely fuel concerns about safety at such venues and whether checks need to be strengthened. Did you witness what happened?

"This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate Seven different parties, a rainbow of political colours, met on stage. And inevitably, the tone of the debate was more sombre, fewer signs of the political pantomime that has dominated so much of the conversation in this election so far. All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon clashed during the debate In truth, the sparkiest clashes were not between the Labour representative Rebecca Long-Bailey and the Tories' Rishi Sunak, but between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice. The animosity between the two of them crackled throughout the programme. There were no huge revelations from the stage, although there were spirited clashes on Brexit, the economy, immigration and the NHS. But in a sense the display was representative of the campaign as a whole - like it or not, millions of people will decide on Remain versus Leave. The overall challenge for the Conservatives: keep the Leave vote together and they hope to return to Number 10.  While the Brexit Party is standing against the Tories in plenty of seats, on the big calls they were on the same side during the debate, just as on the biggest question in the campaign, even though they could still cause the Tories a lot of trouble in areas where they hope to unseat Labour. But the Tories' hopes are based on keeping Brexiteers together. Their advantage is not just that Labour's official position is to give the public another go at making the decision, without the leader making his own view known. But that in all corners of the country there are different players who want to stay in the EU. Here in Wales there are seats where the smaller groups have agreed to become a temporary tribe with a form of a Remain alliance. In some places that means that the Remain bloc will splinter into support for several different parties. In the first-past-the-post system that decides who is sent to Westminster, it's not who is third, fourth, or fifth that counts, but who is the number one. Who should I vote for?

"This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate Politicians have shared their plans to tackle security issues in the UK after the terror attack on London Bridge. Seven senior figures from the major political parties took part in a BBC debate ahead of the December general election. The early focus was on the incident in the capital,which saw two people killed and the attacker shot dead. The politicians moved on to more robust discussions on topics including Brexit, the NHS and immigration. In a subdued start to the programme, the Conservatives' Chief Secretary to the TreasuryRishi Sunak, Labour's shadow business secretaryRebecca Long Bailey,Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson,SNP leader and Scottish First MinisterNicola Sturgeon,Plaid Cymru leaderAdam Price,former Green Party co-leaderCaroline Lucasand Brexit Party chairmanRichard Ticeall laid out their plans for security after a question from a retired police chief inspector. LAURA KUENSSBERG:Five against two REALITY CHECK:The claims from the debate FULL PROGRAMME:Catch-up on iPlayer VIDEO:Watch the best bits FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways AS IT HAPPENED:The debate live All seven paid tribute to the emergency services and the public for their response. Mr Sunak said it was the ""first duty of every government"" to keep the public safe. He promised the Conservatives would ""continue to do that"" by investing in police and giving them the powers they need to tackle threats to the UK. Labour's Ms Long-Bailey agreed there needed to be more investment in police. But she said Tory cuts had reduced personnel by 20,000 - the number by which Boris Johnson has pledged to increase forces if he continues as prime minister. ""It is right to recognise the direct impact [of those cuts] and invest more in community policing - the eyes and ears of our communities,"" Ms Long-Bailey added. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external The Lib Dems' Ms Swinson also promised 20,000 more police officers, and backed the need for community policing. She then praised police work in Scotland - namely the violence reduction unit in Glasgow, which has been credited withmore than halving incidents of knife crime. The Brexit Party's Mr Tice added to the calls for more police on the streets of the UK, but said ""people must remain vigilant"" in light of attacks. For the Green Party, Ms Lucas accepted no amount of police could prevent such incidents, but added: ""More police would help."" She also said political leaders ""all have a responsibility... to show compassion and love"" in light of attacks such as the one in London Bridge. This video can not be played Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey and Conservative Rishi Sunak argue over their spending promises Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would ""make sure we support our security services"". But she said Brexit would stop the UK from ""keeping access to the best intelligence"". And Plaid's Mr Price said there had to be ""a multiplicity of answers as no one answer will keep us safe"". He said resources were ""always part of the answer"", and called for a rise in numbers in Wales, but he also suggested ""a more preventative approach"" to stop the ""normalisation"" of knife crime. When it came to Brexit, the debate became more heated. Mr Sunak stuck by the Tories' message that to vote for them to ""get Brexit done"". He said the party ""have got a deal and it's ready to go"", and with a majority in Parliament, it could pass it to stop the ""dither"" of other parties. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives' main campaign messages and escaped largely unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the ante and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the party's policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit Party's Richard Tice provided some fiery moments, which won't have done either any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems' stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a ""seismic"" event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymru's Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labour's record in government in Wales, and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an election campaign issue. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. But he was challenged by Remain-backing politicians over Boris Johnson's pledge to do a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, and his threat to leave without a deal if the deadline isn't reached. Ms Swinson, who says the Lib Dems will cancel Brexit if they win the election, said: ""It is like we're in episode one of a 10 season box set, and if you don't like what you've seen up to now you don't have to watch the rest."" Ms Sturgeon said the slogan to ""get Brexit done"" was ""the biggest con of this election"", backed by the Greens' Ms Lucas, who said Mr Johnson's deal was ""just the start of years more wrangling"". Mr Sunak failed to rule out a no-deal Brexit when pressed by the other candidates. However, the Brexit Party's Mr Tice said it was time to get a deal done regardless, adding: ""Just imagine, with Brexit done properly we have an amazing future - and that's why I am here."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Tice clash On spending plans, Labour's Ms Long-Bailey claimed her party had ""the most detailed manifesto"" while the Tories had ""fabricated lies"" about their own spending. But Mr Sunak accused his rivals of being ""reckless"", claiming the Conservative manifesto was ""fully costed"". Ms Swinson replied: ""If you're listening to that and you think in your heart of hearts you just know that's not true, then you need to look for parties who are going to set out where they will get the money from."" The ongoing row over whether the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US post-Brexitagain reared its head, with the SNP's Ms Sturgeon calling for the Tories to support a law blocking its inclusion. But Mr Tice accused parties of ""scaremongering"" and said Labour - who first raised the concern - of not knowing the difference between buying and selling. In another clash, the Tories and the Brexit Party backed plans for an ""Australian-style"" points based system for immigration, with Mr Tice blaming immigration levels for suppressing wages in the UK. But Ms Lucas said she was ""proud to stand up"" for the EU's existing free movement rules. Mr Price said it would not be possible to apply EU rules ""exactly"" to the rest of the world, but people should be welcome to come to the UK. The final question to each politician was what message they wanted to give Donald Trump, who is due to come to the UK next week for a Nato summit. Mr Sunak simply wished him a ""happy Thanksgiving"", while Ms Sturgeon said: ""Please step down"".

General election policy guide The audience will be selected by the Question Time production team to reflect how people of all ages in the country have voted. People apply online or by phone and will be asked about their past voting patterns and future voting intentions, whether they're members of political parties, and how they voted in the EU referendum. The BBC aims to represent audiences across the UK during its election coverage, so while the audience will probably be broadly local to the venue, to ensure there are sufficient supporters of all the parties some will have travelled further. You can read more about the BBC's election debateshere, and the BBC's election guidelineshere. The production team will ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it. Throughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to ask further spontaneous questions to the panel, or, of course, to make their own comments.

"This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate The latest election debate saw figures from seven political parties square off for the first time on television this election campaign. Here are some of the key moments. Tempers frayed over the future of the health service, which has been a big theme during the election campaign. Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey reprisedher party's claimthat the NHS is under threat from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, saying initial trade discussions showed services would be ""on the table"". The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon backed her, as did the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said the NHS was ""not for sale,"" and accused Labour of peddling a ""conspiracy theory"". The Brexit Party's Richard Tice then took things up a notch, branding Labour's claim ""ludicrous,"" and accusing the party of ""scaremongering"". He got a short round of applause when he railed against drugs waste in the NHS. Ms Long-Bailey then was asked to defend a claim in a Labour email to supporters that patients could face a five-figure bill for cancer treatment in future.  As she was answering the question, Mr Tice spoke over her, saying: ""No one's going to privatise the NHS [...] it's rubbish.""

In last week'sBBC Question Time debate, there were also some difficult audience questions. This time around, the audience was noticeably quieter. As might be expected, the mood at the start of the debate was fairly sombre, as politicians and the public reacted to the London Bridge attacks earlier in the day. But things didn't get much louder from then, with the various interventions garnering little scorn or applause. This video can not be played Mixed answers on whether representatives would use nuclear weapons It's a classic election-time question: would the politicians, or their party leaders, retaliate in kind if the UK were under nuclear attack? Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, and the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon all ruled it out. The Brexit Party's Richard Tice said he would do so, after ""careful consideration"". Rishi Sunak, Jo Swinson and Rebecca Long-Bailey also said they would, if circumstances required. Several of the politicians backed up their policy positions with anecdotes about their loved ones. Adam Price worried that his 84-year-old father could wake up on 13 December to the 11th Conservative government of his lifetime ,despite never having voted for the party. Jo Swinson praised her father for teaching her ""always to ask questions, to challenge the way things are"". And Rishi Sunak praised his seven-year-old daughter, a ""climate-change champion"" who ""turns off all the lights"" and ""makes sure that the tap is off when she's brushing her teeth"". The biggest reaction came from the audience when the seven politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds in his presence. Ms Sturgeon was brief: ""Please stand down."" Ms Lucas, perhaps unsurprisingly, focused on climate change, saying she would tell the leader to ""get your act together"" and rejoin theParis agreementto cut emissions. The prize for politeness went to Mr Sunak, who would merely wish Mr Trump a ""happy Thanksgiving"" (which was on Thursday).

"Claim:Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that under EU law ""you cannot ban the shipment of live animals"". Reality Check verdict:He is right. Under EU single market rules, no member state can ban live animal exports, although the EU does put a number of animal welfare restrictions on exporting them. The prime minister has made this claim repeatedly during the general election campaign and has said ""the opportunity of Brexit"" would allow his government to ""champion animal welfare"". The Conservative Party manifesto also says that the UK would be able to ban live shipments after Brexit, but it does not make a pledge to do so. The party's 2017 manifesto stated the UK could take early steps to control the export of live farm animals for slaughter after Brexit as well. In 2018 the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said a ban wasone of the options being considered.,external There have been a number of campaigns in the UK against live animal exports for slaughter on welfare grounds. Under the rules of the European Union (EU) single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports. This was tested in the High Court in 2014, after the deaths of 40 sheep which were being transported through the port of Ramsgate in Kent. A temporary ban on live animal exports was imposed by Thanet District Council but was challenged in court. It was ruled unlawful because it ""breached a fundamental element of the rules governing free trade in the EU"". The EU puts a number of restrictions on exporting live animals. These include ensuring adequate space for them, and providing food, water and rest. The rules have to be followed while the animals are transported between the member states, and also beyond the EU borders. Under current EU law, it is an offence to transport any animal in a way likely to cause injury or undue suffering. However, transporters of live animalshave regularly been found breaking the rules.The EU recently publishedrecommendations for improved inspections,externalin the member states. Under the rules of the EU single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports altogether. Brexit: Fresh advice over exports of animal products Minister opposes live animal exports ban Under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, live exports of animals would continue during the transition period. The transition, which will allow both sides to negotiate a future trade deal, is due to finish at the end of 2020. It can be extended, but Mr Johnson has ruled that out if the Conservatives win a majority in the new Parliament. After the transition, the UK would no longer have to abide by EU single market rules and could introduce the ban. But it might not be completely straightforward. The ability to bring in a ban could depend on the exact detail of any future trade deal between the UK and the EU. Any changes would also have to be in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which the UK is a member.  Â£2.4bnValue 2014-2018 74%From England 9%From Scotland 5%From Wales 3%From Northern Ireland WTO rules limitÂ countries'Â abilityÂ toÂ banÂ importsÂ or exportsÂ of goods. This is the basis on which the UK ban would be challenged at the WTO, asthe RSPCA pointed out in its 2018 briefing.,external Also, if the UK banned live exports but still allowed the transport to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this would contravene the rule which prohibits WTO members from treating countries differently on trade in the same product. For Northern Ireland, live animal movements are a key issue, because livestock is regularly moved across the border with the Republic in both directions. An estimated 5,000 lambs,externalare exported to the Republic every week, with 1,000 cattle and 10,000 pigs moving in the other direction. In addition, calves from Northern Ireland destined for France are regularly transported through ports in the Republic.

It was ruled unlawful because it ""breached a fundamental element of the rules governing free trade in the EU"". The EU puts a number of restrictions on exporting live animals. These include ensuring adequate space for them, and providing food, water and rest. The rules have to be followed while the animals are transported between the member states, and also beyond the EU borders. Under current EU law, it is an offence to transport any animal in a way likely to cause injury or undue suffering. However, transporters of live animalshave regularly been found breaking the rules.The EU recently publishedrecommendations for improved inspections,externalin the member states. Under the rules of the EU single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports altogether. Brexit: Fresh advice over exports of animal products Minister opposes live animal exports ban Under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, live exports of animals would continue during the transition period. The transition, which will allow both sides to negotiate a future trade deal, is due to finish at the end of 2020. It can be extended, but Mr Johnson has ruled that out if the Conservatives win a majority in the new Parliament. After the transition, the UK would no longer have to abide by EU single market rules and could introduce the ban. But it might not be completely straightforward. The ability to bring in a ban could depend on the exact detail of any future trade deal between the UK and the EU. Any changes would also have to be in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which the UK is a member.  Â£2.4bnValue 2014-2018 74%From England 9%From Scotland 5%From Wales 3%From Northern Ireland WTO rules limitÂ countries'Â abilityÂ toÂ banÂ importsÂ or exportsÂ of goods. This is the basis on which the UK ban would be challenged at the WTO, asthe RSPCA pointed out in its 2018 briefing.,external Also, if the UK banned live exports but still allowed the transport to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this would contravene the rule which prohibits WTO members from treating countries differently on trade in the same product. For Northern Ireland, live animal movements are a key issue, because livestock is regularly moved across the border with the Republic in both directions. An estimated 5,000 lambs,externalare exported to the Republic every week, with 1,000 cattle and 10,000 pigs moving in the other direction. In addition, calves from Northern Ireland destined for France are regularly transported through ports in the Republic. A parliamentary committee looked into this issue,externaland concluded that ""trade in live animals with the Republic of Ireland should be allowed to continue"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK and US  ""traditionally don't get involved in each other's elections"" Boris Johnson has warned the US president against giving him an endorsement ahead of the general election on 12 December. Donald Trump has previously backed the prime minister,calling him ""the exact right guy for the times"". But during an interview with LBC, Mr Johnson said it was ""best... for neither side to be involved in the other's election campaigns"". Mr Trump is due in the UK next week to join world leaders for a Nato summit. Protests have been planned against the president to coincide with a banquet at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen will host him. LIVE: Latest from the election campaign Parties to be quizzed in seven-way election debate Labour to launch 'regional manifestos' in England Lib Dems pledge end to 'constitutional chaos' In an interview on LBC on Friday, Mr Johnson was asked if the support of the US president was ""welcome"". He said: ""We have very close relationships and friendships with the United States at every level of government, but what we don't do traditionally as loving allies and friends... is get involved in each other's election campaigns."" Mr Johnson citedthe moment former US President Barack Obama intervened in the 2016 EU referendum- saying in a press conference in London the UK was ""at its best when it's helping to lead a strong European Union"" and would end up at ""the back of the queue"" for American trade deals if it left. The PM said it was a ""cardinal moment"" of the campaign when Mr Obama ""turned up and waded in on the side of Remain"", and it was ""not entirely conducive to the good of that cause"". Mr Johnson also joked that he had offered possible Democratic Presidential Candidate, Michael Bloomberg, his support when he was running for one of his terms as New York Mayor, ""but he thought about it and said on the whole he wondered whether I could support his opponent"". But he concluded: ""It's best when you have close friends and allies like the US and the UKâ¦ for neither side to be involved in other's election campaigns."" The comments come amid a growing row around whether the NHS would form part of a trade deal with the US after Brexit. Earlier this week, Labour shared uncensored government documents covering discussions between UK and US negotiators ahead of formal trade talks. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the 451-page dossier was ""proof"" the Conservatives were putting the NHS ""up for sale"", as it showed a request for ""total market access"" from the US, and proposals around drug pricing and patents. But Mr Johnson said the claims were ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. Read our Reality Check team's analysis of the document here.

"IT problems experienced by NatWest account holders on Friday have been resolved, the bank has said. The High Street bank said there had been a glitch affecting mobile and online transactions throughout the day. Friday was payday for some customers, and many were seeking out Black Friday offers. ""All our services are now operating as normal. We apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused,"" a NatWest spokesperson said. The bank said debit cards, credit cards, ATMs, telephone and branch banking services had not been affected. However the inability to transfer money between accounts caused problems for some including asthmatic Tim Pitman who moved money hoping to pay for a prescription. The 49-year-old singer, from Glastonbury, said he had to borrow money from a friend to pay at the chemist, which was a 15-minute drive away. He said NatWest should have been clearer with customers who were affected. Some of those customers include people hoping to get a deal during Black Friday promotions. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Forensics experts check the scene at Grote Marktstraat. The three victims of a stabbing attack on a shopping street in the Dutch city of The Hague on Friday were two girls aged 15 and a boy of 13. None of the victims knew each other and police are still hunting a male suspect, with no clue as yet to motive. The victims have now been released from hospital. Images and videos on social media showed dozens of Black Friday shoppers running away from the scene after the attacker struck at 19:45 (18:45 GMT). The victims have not been named but were described as a 13-year-old boy from The Hague, a 15-year-old girl from Alphen aan den Rijn and another 15-year-old girl from Leiderdorp. The incident happened at the Hudson's Bay store in the city's Grote Marktstraat, or main market square. Police have urged the public to contact them if they witnessed the attack. Officials have also asked anyone with images or footage of the attack to send it to the police. An initial description of the suspect suggested police were looking for a man aged between 45 to 50 wearing a grey tracksuit. In a later update, Hague police said that description was wrong but have given few further details about the incident. They said in a statement: ""We are using all the means at our disposal - both visible and invisible - to find the suspect of this incident as quickly as possible. ""The motive of the suspect is as yet unclear."" The city's Deputy Mayor Boudewijn Revis told de Volkskrant: ""On a night when a lot of people do their shopping in one of our busiest shopping streets, something so terrible happens.""

"This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate Politicians have shared their plans to tackle security issues in the UK after the terror attack on London Bridge. Seven senior figures from the major political parties took part in a BBC debate ahead of the December general election. The early focus was on the incident in the capital,which saw two people killed and the attacker shot dead. The politicians moved on to more robust discussions on topics including Brexit, the NHS and immigration. In a subdued start to the programme, the Conservatives' Chief Secretary to the TreasuryRishi Sunak, Labour's shadow business secretaryRebecca Long Bailey,Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson,SNP leader and Scottish First MinisterNicola Sturgeon,Plaid Cymru leaderAdam Price,former Green Party co-leaderCaroline Lucasand Brexit Party chairmanRichard Ticeall laid out their plans for security after a question from a retired police chief inspector. LAURA KUENSSBERG:Five against two REALITY CHECK:The claims from the debate FULL PROGRAMME:Catch-up on iPlayer VIDEO:Watch the best bits FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways AS IT HAPPENED:The debate live All seven paid tribute to the emergency services and the public for their response. Mr Sunak said it was the ""first duty of every government"" to keep the public safe. He promised the Conservatives would ""continue to do that"" by investing in police and giving them the powers they need to tackle threats to the UK. Labour's Ms Long-Bailey agreed there needed to be more investment in police. But she said Tory cuts had reduced personnel by 20,000 - the number by which Boris Johnson has pledged to increase forces if he continues as prime minister. ""It is right to recognise the direct impact [of those cuts] and invest more in community policing - the eyes and ears of our communities,"" Ms Long-Bailey added. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external The Lib Dems' Ms Swinson also promised 20,000 more police officers, and backed the need for community policing. She then praised police work in Scotland - namely the violence reduction unit in Glasgow, which has been credited withmore than halving incidents of knife crime. The Brexit Party's Mr Tice added to the calls for more police on the streets of the UK, but said ""people must remain vigilant"" in light of attacks. For the Green Party, Ms Lucas accepted no amount of police could prevent such incidents, but added: ""More police would help."" She also said political leaders ""all have a responsibility... to show compassion and love"" in light of attacks such as the one in London Bridge. This video can not be played Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey and Conservative Rishi Sunak argue over their spending promises Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would ""make sure we support our security services"". But she said Brexit would stop the UK from ""keeping access to the best intelligence"". And Plaid's Mr Price said there had to be ""a multiplicity of answers as no one answer will keep us safe"". He said resources were ""always part of the answer"", and called for a rise in numbers in Wales, but he also suggested ""a more preventative approach"" to stop the ""normalisation"" of knife crime. When it came to Brexit, the debate became more heated. Mr Sunak stuck by the Tories' message that to vote for them to ""get Brexit done"". He said the party ""have got a deal and it's ready to go"", and with a majority in Parliament, it could pass it to stop the ""dither"" of other parties. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives' main campaign messages and escaped largely unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the ante and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the party's policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit Party's Richard Tice provided some fiery moments, which won't have done either any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems' stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a ""seismic"" event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymru's Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labour's record in government in Wales, and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an election campaign issue. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. But he was challenged by Remain-backing politicians over Boris Johnson's pledge to do a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, and his threat to leave without a deal if the deadline isn't reached. Ms Swinson, who says the Lib Dems will cancel Brexit if they win the election, said: ""It is like we're in episode one of a 10 season box set, and if you don't like what you've seen up to now you don't have to watch the rest."" Ms Sturgeon said the slogan to ""get Brexit done"" was ""the biggest con of this election"", backed by the Greens' Ms Lucas, who said Mr Johnson's deal was ""just the start of years more wrangling"". Mr Sunak failed to rule out a no-deal Brexit when pressed by the other candidates. However, the Brexit Party's Mr Tice said it was time to get a deal done regardless, adding: ""Just imagine, with Brexit done properly we have an amazing future - and that's why I am here."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Tice clash On spending plans, Labour's Ms Long-Bailey claimed her party had ""the most detailed manifesto"" while the Tories had ""fabricated lies"" about their own spending. But Mr Sunak accused his rivals of being ""reckless"", claiming the Conservative manifesto was ""fully costed"". Ms Swinson replied: ""If you're listening to that and you think in your heart of hearts you just know that's not true, then you need to look for parties who are going to set out where they will get the money from."" The ongoing row over whether the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US post-Brexitagain reared its head, with the SNP's Ms Sturgeon calling for the Tories to support a law blocking its inclusion. But Mr Tice accused parties of ""scaremongering"" and said Labour - who first raised the concern - of not knowing the difference between buying and selling. In another clash, the Tories and the Brexit Party backed plans for an ""Australian-style"" points based system for immigration, with Mr Tice blaming immigration levels for suppressing wages in the UK. But Ms Lucas said she was ""proud to stand up"" for the EU's existing free movement rules. Mr Price said it would not be possible to apply EU rules ""exactly"" to the rest of the world, but people should be welcome to come to the UK. The final question to each politician was what message they wanted to give Donald Trump, who is due to come to the UK next week for a Nato summit. Mr Sunak simply wished him a ""happy Thanksgiving"", while Ms Sturgeon said: ""Please step down"". This video can not be played Adam Price attacks Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit But while others brought up Brexit and climate change, Mr Price responded: ""Resign and take Boris with you.""

"This year's Black Friday sale could break buying records in the UK, early figures suggest. At 10:00 GMT, Barclaycard said transaction volumes were up 12.5% from last year, and between 13:00 and 14:00 they were 9% higher. ""The fact that records are continuing to be broken suggests that appetite for Black Friday sales is not abating,"" said Rob Cameron from Barclaycard. John Lewis said buyers were snapping up Apple iPads and Lego Star Wars toys. The department store also reported interest in cut-price aftershave and underwear, as shoppers seek bargains for gifts. However, some of the most popular gifts are not being discounted, according to Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at Money.co.uk. Extinction Rebellion protested at the Black Friday sales at Oxford Circus over disposable fashion ""Consumers hoping to snap up one of this year's most popular gadgets today could be disappointed as our research found there are very few Black Friday deals to be had on the most sought-after products,"" he said. ""It begs the question, are stores discounting the products that shoppers really want, or slashing prices on the gear they have been unable to shift throughout the year? Black Friday: I feel guilty about how much I return Loan sharks cash in on Black Friday spending spree The website's research found discounts on products such as the Nintendo Switch gaming console and GoPro digital cameras were hard to come by at big retailers.

"This video can not be played E.On's UK head Michael Lewis says the energy retail market is under ""considerable strain"" Energy firm Npower is to cut up to 4,500 UK jobs as part of a plan to make it more profitable. Three call centres are under threat of closure, at Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, an office in Hull and one in Worcester. Unions called the action a ""cruel blow"" for the company's workers in the run-up to Christmas. Under the restructuring, Npower's owner E.On will merge computer systems to save money. ""The UK market is currently particularly challenging,"" said Johannes Teyssen, E.On chief executive. ""We've emphasised repeatedly that we'll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability."" The company said reports from unions of 4,500 job cuts were of the correct ""order of magnitude"", but that the final figure would not be announced while it is still consulting with unions. There are around 2,500 jobs at Houghton-le-Spring, and more than 600 at each of the Hull and Worcester offices. Npower's other sites in the UK are at Leeds, Birmingham, Swindon, Solihull and Oldbury. The restructuring plan - which is set to cost Npower Â£500m - would see small businesses and consumers served by the same computer systems and customer service teams. Large industrial customers would still be served separately. This is a Goldilocks moment in the energy sector. Businesses do not want to be too big or too small to be just right. The biggest suppliers have pointed to the pressures they face on their domestic business from the energy price cap, although this has been to the benefit of millions of consumers. Legacy IT systems also cost a lot. Meanwhile, 16 small energy companies have collapsed since the beginning of last year. Many had grown too quickly, leading to terrible customer service. Their size also meant they struggled to cope with price changes on the wholesale markets. So, that leaves those in the middle, some of which have been successfully picking up domestic customers through switches and serving them through more nimble IT systems. Analysts Cornwall Insight say challenger brands now hold a 30% share of the household energy market, up from 18% two years ago. In four years, it says there could be a 50/50 split between the big six and the challengers. Npower's announcement adds some weight to that prediction. Germany-based E.On said profit for the first nine months of its financial year fell 27% to â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn). The firm said its division serving households would effectively be merged into E.On's. The government-imposed price cap had eroded profits, as it had at competitors, it said. Its division serving other businesses ""is a profitable very good business,"" it said, and would keep the Npower brand name. The GMB union said the announcement would be a ""body blow"" to Npower workers. ""Government has to urgently wake up to the impact that the price cap is having on good and reasonably well-paid jobs in UK energy companies. New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo deal 'Big six' energy firm to cut 900 jobs Do you work for Npower? Get in touch:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""Npower is a poorly managed company with significant losses in the UK but it's always the workers that face the brunt of poor management coupled with regulation that sends work overseas whilst sacking energy workers in the UK."" Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said the news was a ""cruel blow"" for workers. ""They've been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas. ""The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse. If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties,"" he said, urging the government to take ownership of the retail businesses of the six largest providers. Npower, one of the big six energy providers in the UK, announced plans in January to cut 900 jobs in another attempt to save costs. The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap, which began at the start of January.

"The owner of the Daily Mail, DMGT, has bought the i newspaper and website for Â£49.6m from JPI Media. DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said the paper was ""a highly respected publication with a loyal and engaged readership"". ""We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high-quality and politically independent editorial style."" The Competition and Markets Authority will have to approve the deal. In 2018, the i reported an operating profit of Â£11m from Â£34m in sales. The deal means that the paper will have its fourth owner in as many years. The sale was attacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said in a tweet that two billionaires now owned half the UK's top 10 daily newspapers. Allow Twitter content?

The i was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to the Independent. It sells for 65p on weekdays and Â£1.20 on Saturdays. When it first hit the newsstands, executives at the company said it was aimed at ""time-poor newspaper readers"", especially commuters, who lacked the time to read a quality newspaper on a regular basis. At its launch, it shared the same editorial staff as its sister paper and was seen as a way of extending the Independent's brand to a new market. But in 2016, the Independent closed its print edition and the i was sold for Â£24m to Johnston Press. Despite this, links to the paper's former parent remained, with the i continuing to provide a print home for some of the Independent's now otherwise digital-only content. In November 2018, the i changed hands again after Johnston Press was bought out of administration by JPI Media. DMGT had been mulling the purchase for at least a year, but was beaten by JPI Media's deal with administrators. Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK with a history dating back more than 250 years, but it had debts of Â£220m. The deal leaves JPI with The Scotsman and Yorkshire Post among its biggest titles. In total, it owns about 200 newspaper brands. If the DMGT deal is approved, the UK's national newspapers will be owned by just six companies. DMGTalready owns the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro. Reach, formerly known as Trinity Mirror, owns the Daily Mirror, Sunday People, Daily Express, Daily Star and associated Sunday titles.

"Activists formed a human chain outside an Amazon depot Activists across France have staged Black Friday protests against Amazon, decrying consumerism and its impact on the environment. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the company's French headquarters in Clichy, north of Paris. Protesters also tried to blockade a shopping centre in Paris and a logistics centre near the eastern city of Lyon. In video from Lyon riot police can be seen dragging activists away. The protests aimed to disrupt Black Friday, a discount shopping day that activists have blamed for environmental damage. In response, Amazon told the BBC it respected the right to protest but disagreed with ""the actions of these individuals"". Amazon hit by Black Friday walkouts and protests 'I feel guilty about how much I return' Amazon boss promises climate-change action Firms make green energy vows as call for action grow Similar protests against Amazon erupted in other European countries, including Germany, where workers from six distribution centres staged a walkout over pay and conditions. The union Verdi, which called the strike, said its members' hard work could not be bought for ""knock-down prices"". Union members at this distribution centre in Werne, Germany went on strike Some French lawmakers want to ban Black Friday because of its environmental impact, and Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne has warned against the ""consumption frenzy"" linked to the event. The shopping day began in the US on the Friday after Thanksgiving but in recent years spread to other countries. Environmentalists have accused Amazon of accelerating climate change through its rapid delivery services, which they say contribute to greenhouse gases emissions. This video can not be played Some of the activists in Clichy scaled a fence overnight Amazon ships around 10 billion packages per year,according to Reuters news agency,external. To mitigate its impact on the climate,the US e-commerce company pledged to go net carbon neutral by 2040by investing in electric delivery vans, among other initiatives. Manon Aubry, a left-wing member of the European parliament, said the protest was intended to ""denounce the social, environmental and fiscal damage from Amazon"". Video from a protest in Lyon showed police in riot helmets dragging away activists Coline Vanhenacker, a spokeswoman for environmental group Friends of the Earth, said Amazon represented ""overproduction, overconsumption and overwaste"". ""Today 25% of French greenhouse gas emissions are linked to textiles and electronics products and Amazon is the leading distributor so we have to put a stop to it,"" she said. The demonstrations, dubbed ""Block Friday"", are aiming to disrupt Amazon's business operations in France and other countries. One of the groups involved in organising the protests, anti-globalisation movement Attac, said it would ""take action across France to disrupt Amazon's business"". Activists hold a banner that reads ""Stop Amazon and its world"" in Nantes France's first protest was held on Thursday, when dozens of activists formed a human chain, lay on hay bales and dumped old fridges and microwaves outside the Amazon depot in Bretigny-sur-Orge. At the protest, about 40km (24 miles) south of Paris, some activists held banners which read: ""Amazon: for the climate, for employment, stop expanding, stop over-production"". More demonstrations took place on Friday, with environmental groups threatening to turn 29 November into a ""Black Day for Amazon"". Demonstrators aimed to disrupt Amazon's business operations across France on Black Friday As of Friday morning, dozens of activists from various groups had gathered outside Amazon France's facilities, including its headquarters in Clichy. They held up a sign saying: ""No to Amazon and its world."" In Lyon, a sit-down protest outside an Amazon distribution centre degenerated into skirmishes between activists and riot police carrying batons and shields. One of the groups involved, Lyon Climat, accused the police of being heavy-handed. Footage posted to social media showed police hauling some activists along the floor. In Paris, around 40 young protesters attempted to block the doorway of a large shopping centre in La DÃ©fense business district of the city. They linked arms to stop people entering the shopping centre and chanted: ""Work, consume and shut up, that is the message given to our youth."" Greenhouse gas concentrations again break records China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Climate signal links global floods and fires In a statement, Amazon said it respected ""everyone's right to voice their opinions"" but disagrees with the means used by some protesters. It accused Attac of spreading ""false allegations"" and ""pointing the finger at Amazon for political ends"". Amazon said it would continue to serve its customers despite the protests ""Amazon directly employs 9,300 people in France, provides business opportunities for thousands of companies and SMEs in France, and has made ambitious commitments in our 'Climate Pledge' plan to become a net zero carbon company ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement,"" the company told the BBC. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply wrong."" Recent polling data carried by the Huffington Post,externaldoes suggest the popularity of Black Friday may be waning in France. A third of people surveyed by YouGov France said they were not planning to take part in this year's sales. A majority of respondents - 57% - said they believed the promotions were false. Some MPs want to, citing concerns over the effects of consumerism on the planet. An ""anti-waste"" bill was amended to include a proposal to prohibit Black Friday by a French legislative committee on Monday. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly France's former Environment Minister Delphine Batho tabled the amendment, which will be debated next month in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. ""Black Friday celebrates a model of consumption that is anti-ecological and anti-social,"" said MP Mattieu Orphelin, a former member of President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party. A trade union in France has opposed the proposal. So too have conservative MPs, including Republican lawmaker Eric Woerth, who called the debate over the amendment a ""useless row"".

"Prime Minister Muscat is facing calls to resign over the murder of Daphne Curuana Galizia Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has said a suspect in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia will not be granted immunity to reveal what he knows about the case. Businessman Yorgen Fenech had requested a presidential pardon in exchange for information. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption activist, was killed by a car bomb. Mr Fenech appeared in court on Friday to argue the chief investigator of the case, Keith Arnaud, should be removed. Mr Muscat is under increasing pressure to resign over the case, which started when Ms Galizia was killed in 2017. Mr Fenech's lawyers argue that Mr Arnaud should be removed, due to alleged ties to Mr Muscat and Keith Schembri,  the prime minister's former aide who is allegedly linked to the killing. Mr Schembri resigned last week as chief of staff to the prime minister and was arrested on Tuesday. Mr Fenech has filed a request for President George Vella, and not the cabinet, to consider his request for a pardon, alleging a conflict of interest. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Europe Correspondent It was the most bizarre of sights. The man at the centre of the murder investigation that's rocking Malta strolled out of court, calmly lit a cigarette and walked down the street. Shaven-headed, wearing sunglasses and an expensive suit, Yorgen Fenech was immediately surrounded by journalists. Mr Fenech is one of Malta's richest individuals. I asked him if he was going to name people close to the prime minister who he suggests are implicated in events connected to the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia. He replied in the affirmative, adding he was ""determined that the truth will come out"". When I asked if he himself had ordered the journalist's assassination, he flashed back: ""No I didn't say that. I'm confident the truth will come out."" Mr Fenech's lawyers say the chief police investigator is too close to those around Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, and they claimed in court that there was evidence his chief of staff was leaking secret details about the police investigation. Claims and counter-claims of murky dealings: more reasons why many believe Daphne Caruana Galizia was right about the rotten nature of Malta's state. The prime minister has previously said he will only step down when those who ordered the killing are identified. However,the Times of Malta reported on Friday,externalthat Mr Muscat was preparing to announce his resignation ""immediately"" amid the worsening political crisis. Mr Muscat's Labour Party has cancelled an event on Sunday at which the prime minister was due to speak. The murder that could bring down Malta's government Resignations spark Malta crisis in murder scandal In another development, Council of Europe special rapporteur Pieter Omtzigt, who was appointed in 2018 to monitor the inquiry, called on Mr Muscat to resign.

""Only the three initial suspects have been charged and no-one has been convicted,""he said in a statement,external. ""It is therefore absolutely essential that the next government is free of the suspicions of corruption and misconduct that surrounded the Muscat administration."" Last week Mr Fenech was arrested in a dramatic raid on his yacht. He received hospital treatment after his arrest and has been given police bail. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. Caruana Galizia wrote about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging it had links to senior government figures. Mr Muscat called an emergency cabinet meeting on Thursday night to decide whether to grant Mr Fenech's request. The prime minister said it was the most appropriate course as Mr Fenech had made allegations against the PM's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri - who resigned last week and was arrested on Tuesday. ""I left the final decision with my colleagues, who decided that it's not fitting to grant a pardon,"" Mr Muscat announced at a press conference, flanked by ministers. He stressed that his cabinet had followed the advice of the chief of police and the attorney general. Police confirmed on Thursday that Mr Schembri had been released and was no longer of interest to investigators. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Angry protesters gathered outside the government palace in the early hours of Friday morning. One of Caruana Galizia's sons threw fruit at the car of a government minister and shouted insults, Reuters news agency reports. Under Malta's constitution a pardon can be granted to ""any person concerned in or convicted of any offence"". Investigations into Caruana Galizia's murder intensified when a suspected middleman was pardoned on Monday. The prime minister told parliament the suspect, Melvin Theuma, was being given immunity in return for information about the killing. Maltese reports suggested he had audio recordings linked to the case. On Tuesday, Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi resigned and Economy Minister Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself after being questioned by police on Saturday. They deny involvement. Protests outside government buildings have intensified Mr Muscat's chief aide, Keith Schembri, who had previously been named in the Panama Papers, quit. Caruana Galizia alleged that Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi had benefited from secretive ""shell companies"". Both deny wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio 150,000 euros (Â£132,000),Reuters news agency reports,external. Police have continued to investigate in the hope of finding out who ordered the killing. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children The late journalist's sister, Corinne Vella, told the BBC it was time the truth came out. ""We're finally starting to see some progress in the investigation into Daphne's murder,"" she said. ""It's welcome, it's important, but it's very far long overdue. To us, Daphne's death has always been linked to her work, and we've maintained all along that justice for Daphne means justice for her murder, but also justice for all her stories, because to us they were connected.""

"An archaic law policing women's behaviour was repealed and the party of the former regime was dissolved Sudan has repealed a restrictive public order law that controlled how women acted and dressed in public. On Twitter, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok paid tribute to women who had ""endured the atrocities that resulted from the implementation of this law"". The country's transitional authorities also dissolved the party of former President Omar al-Bashir. Mr Bashir seized power in a 1989 coup and ruled for nearly 30 years before peaceful protests ousted him in April. Sudan is currently led by a joint military and civilian council, as well as a civilian-led cabinet headed by Prime Minister Hamdok. Allow Twitter content?

Both the repeal of the public order law and dissolution of the National Congress Party (NCP) were a response to key demands of the protest movement, which aims to dismantle Mr Bashir's regime. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Khartoum overnight at news of the moves. Sudan's revolutionaries pin hopes on new PM Thousands demand justice for Sudan protesters Africa Live: More on this and other stories Aisha Musa, one of two women on Sudan's new Sovereign Council, told BBC Newsday that while the former regime had focused on how women dressed and acted - including preventing women from wearing trousers - it had ignored their education and healthcare. ""It is about time that all this corruption stops, that all this treatment for the women of Sudan stops,"" she said. A 2017 report by two charities described the restrictions,externalas a blend of legal and moral prohibitions ""designed to exclude and intimidate women from actively participating in public life"". They gave the authorities sweeping powers to arbitrarily control what women wore, whom they spoke to and saw, and any job they might hold - with any perceived offender facing punishment by flogging, or in rare cases stoning and even execution. Moreover, the public order rules were kept ""vague and open-ended leaving them open to exploitation as a social control tool by the authorities,"" the report said. The women driving change in Sudan Why this woman became symbolic to Sudanese protesters 'Sudanese women have always been in the frontlines' Human rights activist Hala al-Karib told BBC Newsday that repealing the law was a ""massive step"" for her country, arguing the legislation had enforced the old regime's ideology, which was ""based in terror and discrimination"". Authorities had had the power to ""literally hunt women"", she said, and these laws had disproportionately affected poorer women, women from conflict zones and people outside Khartoum. But while she welcomed the end of the law, Ms Karib said more needed to be done to end ""a very discriminatory legal framework"". This video can not be played Ahlam Khidir, a grieving mother and one of the movement's most prominent figures Women were at the forefront of the movement that toppled Mr Bashir. Throughout the demonstrations women were visible on the frontlines, demanding greater freedoms for themselves and their country. ""We need a fair and just country. We have suffered a lot. More than men in many cases. Women should be at the centre of any government,""one activist told Al Jazeera news agency in April,external. One 22-year-old studentAlaa Salah became an icon for demonstratorsafter a video of her leading chants against the former leader went viral, earning her the nickname ""Nubian Queen"". On 25 November, Sudan held its first march in decades for the International Day for Eliminating Violence Against Women. By James Copnall, BBC News, Sudan analyst The decision to revoke the Public Order Law is a momentous step. The authorities used it in particular to control women. Some received 40 lashes for wearing trousers in public. The way the law was applied underlined the divisions and tensions within Sudanese society. In recent years it was common to see rich Khartoum women wearing trousers in public - while those targeted by the morality police were often poorer women from the marginalised areas on the periphery of this vast country. The NCP, meanwhile, was a colossus, the political vehicle for a regime which tried to reshape every part of Sudanese life - and cracked down extremely hard on anybody who disagreed. The authorities hope that dismantling the NCP will help stop the old regime from undermining the transitional government. There is a certain irony about a transitional government set up to move the country to democracy banning a political party. But nobody other than its partisans will mourn the NCP, which is blamed for creating so much misery. Those who led the protests - and women's rights activists in particular - are celebrating the demise of the NCP and the law, even if they recognise this is just the start of a longer struggle to transform Sudan. Dissolving Mr Bashir's National Congress Party (NCP) means that the authorities can seize the party's assets. The decree confirmed that a committee would be formed to do this. This, Mr Hamdok tweeted, was so they could ""retrieve the stolen wealth of the people of Sudan"". The decree also said ""none of the symbols of the regime or party would be allowed to engage in any political activity for 10 years"". The changes announced by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok meet key demands of the protesters A spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, the protest group that toppled Mr Bashir, told the BBC this was ""a historic moment"". ""This is a moment of relief, because each and every person in Sudan has been affected in some way or the other by this regime in a negative manner,"" spokeswoman Samahir Mubarak said. But the NCP condemned the move as ""nothing more than a moral scandal, an act of intellectual bankruptcy and a total failure on the part of the illegal government"". ""The party is not bothered by any law or decision issued against it as the NCP is a strong party and its ideas will prevail,"" a post on the party's Facebook page read. The unrest in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when the Bashir government imposed emergency austerity measures. Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards, and the anger spread to the capital. The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years. In April, the president was overthrown by the military after sit-ins outside the defence ministry, but demonstrators then wanted to ensure authority was swiftly transferred to a civilian administration. A transitional government which came to power in August has vowed to reunite the country.

"David Pemsel spent eight years at Guardian Media Group Newly-appointed Premier League chief executive David Pemsel has resigned before starting the job. Pemsel was appointed in October, and was due to start in February, but has stood down following newspaper allegations about his private life. The Premier League said Richard Masters will stay as interim chief executive. Pemsel was the third person to be offered the job following the departure of ex-chief executive Richard Scudamore, who left in November 2018. Susanna Dinnage was originally named as Scudamore's successor but later declined the role to remain at media organisation Discovery. Senior BBC executive Tim Davie also turned down the chance to take up the post. The Premier League said in a statement: ""Following media disclosures earlier this week and discussions with David Pemsel, the Premier League has today accepted David's resignation and he will no longer be joining as chief executive."" Pemsel's appointment was unanimously approved at a special Premier League shareholders' meeting in October. At the time, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who is also chairman of the Premier League nominations committee, said of Pemsel: ""His straightforward style and personal integrity make him an ideal person to lead the business."" By BBC Sport editor Dan Roan The Premier League has acted decisively since allegations regarding David Pemsel's private life first surfaced two days ago, and executives believe it shows they are a principled organisation. But almost 18 months after previous chief executive Richard Scudamore announced he was stepping down, the fact that the ill-fated and protracted search for a replacement is about to resume for a fourth time is highly embarrassing for an organisation previously renowned for its decision-making and stability. However, with talks over the controversy led by acting chair Claudia Arney, Premier League executives and club officials concluded that Pemsel had demonstrated a lack of judgement that made it impossible for him to take up one of the most powerful jobs in world sport. Maybe acting chief executive Richard Masters, who has impressed while in temporary charge, will now be handed the job permanently.

"Nigel Farage on the campaign trail in Hartlepool, County Durham He's a pro. To watch Nigel Farage in front of a crowd of believers is to witness a well-honed performance. He's in uniform - tweed jacket, tan corduroy trousers, check shirt, knitted red tie, every garment a cultural signal. He jokes with the crowd, and they laugh happily. He invokes the enemy, successively the Lib Dems (hiss), Diane Abbott (laughter), Theresa May (groan) Jeremy Corbyn (boo!). The crowd enjoys it so much, he warns he may have to close the bar, heh-heh-ing to himself as he segues into a pledge of a better future for the fishing industry (this is Grimsby in mid-November, and Farage is on a campaign visit). By the time the Brexit Party leader finishes, with a flailing attack on a corrupt, out-of-date political system, the audience is eating out of his hand. A few days later, in front of a more hostile BBC Question Time audience, he's equally practised. He's done that side of electioneering plenty of times - and maybe the gestures are a bit choppier and the posture less relaxed, but he has been beleaguered in a studio before. No, he's not a racist, and the Brexit Party has an impressively diverse team of candidates, he says. No, he doesn't want to privatise the NHS - but he would like to see more better-off people taking out private health insurance to cut the burden on taxpayers, and he is unimpressed by concerns that this might undermine the principle of a universal service. He wants to limit immigration because the population is rising too fast. Yes, the future outside the EU is bright. Those who expected a cartoon ogre may not be converted, but he's not quite what they expected. Nigel Farage is a political force in his own right - a creator of parties, not a cog within them. That rare sub-species of politician seen by voters as distinctive. He took UKIP - the party he led three times over the course of 20 years, but left last year - from the political fringe to centre stage by stitching together a coalition of angry voters from across normal party lines. In the process, he cornered David Cameron into promising the 2016 referendum. Just four months after he set up the Brexit Party, in February, it topped the polls in the 2019 European Parliamentary elections. This sent him back to Strasbourg for a fifth term as an MEP. Brexit is his baby, if anyone is the father. And those who know Farage well understand his very human reluctance to see someone else dandling his baby on their knee. Part of his fury at the political establishment is because they always treated him with disdain, never acknowledged the scale of his achievement, and now the Conservative leadership want to co-opt it. ""You can make a convincing case that Nigel Farage is the most influential politician of the modern era,"" says Professor Matthew Goodwin, an academic who has studied the rise of UKIP. ""He is responsible for mainstreaming Euroscepticism, bringing about the 2016 referendum and then delivering the vote for Brexit - and it's all the more impressive because he never reached the House of Commons. But maybe the price of that is that he has eroded British political culture and, for his critics, he has eroded consensus and civility."" So how did he do it? One close colleague says he has the strengths (and weaknesses) of his former career as a commodities trader. ""He can spot openings in a market and take snap decisions, but he does not think strategically. He thinks and acts on the spur of the moment, as you would expect of a trader."" Nigel Farage drinks a pint as he visits Seaham, 2019 The gap in the market was for a radical-right populist in a politics dominated by Oxbridge-educated political professionals. Farage may be a prosperous, public-school educated MEP, who can look forward to a generous European Parliament pension after his 20 years in Strasbourg, but his language, style and character were shaped to appeal to working-class blokes and middle-class Eurosceptics. His clothes, his talk about World War Two, the drinking and the laddish vibe all appeal to disaffected voters who don't connect with the elite of orthodox politics. Nigel Paul Farage was born 3 April 1964 in Kent. His stockbroker father was an alcoholic and walked out on the family when Nigel was five. Farage attended fee-paying school Dulwich College in south-east London. At 18, he got a job as a trader in the City. In his 20s Farage was run over by a car, sustaining major injuries. He married his nurse, Grainne Hayes, in 1986. In 1992, he left the Conservatives in protest at the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. In 1993 he became a founding member of UKIP. Farage was elected to the European Parliament in 1999. The same year he married his second wife Kirsten Mehr. He resigned as UKIP leader to stand in the 2010 general election. On election day, Farage was seriously injured in a plane crash. In 2014, Farage led UKIP to the largest share of the vote in the European election. In 2019, Farage stood down from UKIP and launched the Brexit Party. Douglas Carswell, a Conservative MP who defected to UKIP and the only person ever elected under a UKIP banner at a general election, says Farage is driven by his cause: ""If you asked Cameron, or [Gordon] Brown, or Theresa May, why they wanted to be prime minister, they would give you vague answers about being good at the job. Nigel genuinely went into politics to get us out of the European Union. He's the only other leader in my lifetime, apart from Margaret Thatcher, who had a sense of mission which extended beyond themselves."" Farage was one of the first to realise that immigration was becoming a big issue, and he was one of the first to register the alienation in heartland Labour constituencies, where voters, perhaps, felt taken for granted by New Labour. He talks about how at the Oldham by-election of 2011 he walked through the streets and realised those votes were up for grabs, because, he thought, Labour was no longer connected to the concerns of their heartland voters. It was Ed Miliband's decision not to commit to an EU referendum in 2015 that allowed UKIP to take four million votes, many from Labour, in crucial marginal seats. That tilted the electoral balance and allowed David Cameron to win in 2015, but only at the price of committing himself to a referendum. The Brexit Party policy offer is centred on the idea of a challenge to the establishment, in what the party calls a contract with the people (an idea that echoes the Republican Contract with America which won them the 1994 congressional elections). The focus is on ditching what they see as unpopular ideas foisted on an unwilling population by an unaccountable elite. Out goes HS2, the high-speed rail line, the apprenticeship levy and interest charges on student loans. In come promises of investment in left-behind Britain and policies to revive the High Street. There's a particular promise to regenerate fishing communities. Farage is often criticised for his poor attendance record as a member of the European Parliament fisheries committee - one out of a possible 42 meetings. He has said the committee is ""pointless"" and has no legislative or policy role. There's a pledge to invest in strategic industries and create thousands of jobs in steel, railways and defence. Above all, there's a pledge to cap immigration at 50,000 people per year. It all speaks very directly at the areas where UKIP had its greatest electoral success - and where the Brexit Party hopes to inherit that vote. Brexit Party MEPs turn their backs during the European anthem ahead of the inaugural session at the European Parliament, 2019 The former Labour MP John Woodcock who saw UKIP take nearly 12% in his Leave-voting seat, Barrow-in-Furness, in 2015, said Labour campaigners found Farage a frustrating target. This was because lines of attack about his long and lucrative tenure in the European Parliament, and his privileged background, simply didn't stick to him. At the same time, he was perfectly capable of attacking others for being children of privilege, or for doing well out of a career in the EU. ""For all our efforts, he's still seen as someone who speaks truth to power and represents the basic anti-Europeanism that many traditional Labour voters feel,"" Woodcock - who recently announced he would be voting Conservative in the election - said. ""Over the years he has managed to tap into concerns about immigration that are felt in places like Barrow, despite it being 99.4% white British."" Another ex-Labour MP for a Leave seat analyses his appeal: ""White working-class voters are very angry, feel left behind by globalisation and think things are done to them with no-one asking - immigration, their way of life is threatened, and they're told it's redundant or even racist. Nigel Farage speaking in Hartlepool, 2019 ""Nigel Farage would not seem to be their natural spokesman, but he is - he's angry about the same things, he speaks to their patriotism, and he doesn't bang on about market forces, which matters because for a lot of people outside London, their experience of market forces is pretty negative. It's one reason why a lot of Conservative rhetoric doesn't impress them. ""He may be a public schoolboy, but they would send their children to a private school if they could afford it, and he also reaches a group of middle-class voters who are further to the right than many people realise."" And perhaps that sense of identification is why allegations against him don't seem to stick. And there have been plenty. Most spectacularly, he had to deny placing currency bets against sterling on the night of the EU referendum, after he wrongly conceded victory to the Remain camp. His spokesperson insisted Farage ""had no financial interest in currency movements on the night of Brexit"", after claims that currency speculators used inaccurate early predictions of a Remain victory to profit by short-selling the pound. There have also been questions about who funds his personal expenses, and about his European Parliament expenses, but they seem to simply bounce off him. As well as being firmly denied, they don't matter to his core supporters. The other side of that coin is a certain toxicity. In the past he has been accused of scare-mongering, xenophobia and, by some, inciting hatred.  During the 2016 referendum, a great deal of the internal politics of the Leave campaign was about limiting Farage's visibility, so as not to frighten off swing voters. Others argue that the Leave vote needed to mobilise both undecided voters and Farage supporters to succeed. If his voters had stayed at home, the Leave vote would not have been delivered - so perhaps there were some advantages in there being two campaigns, speaking to different constituencies, with different voices. One of Farage's quirks is his reliance on a cadre of highly committed activists, usually younger men like press officer Dan Jukes, or Chris Bruni-Lowe, the former UKIP campaign director who holds the same position in the Brexit Party. In small-party politics, that mattered because he didn't have a vast structure to call on. And he frequently leant on a chief wingman, successively party stalwart Andy Reid, then the self-styled ""Bad Boy of Brexit"" Arron Banks, and now the property developer and millionaire, Richard Tice. They're not underlings, they're people who he looks up to, and whose advice he listens to. Bankshelped bankroll Farageto the tune of Â£450,000 in the year after the Brexit referendum - paying for his London home, his car and trips to the US to meet Donald Trump - saying it was an ""honour to help"". Nigel Farage and Dan Jukes (right), London, 2017 The quality of Farage's output varies with the quality of his wingmen. His tactical errors often stemmed from his taking bad advice from the wingman of the day - in particular, colleagues point to his flirtation with Steve Bannon, the guru of the American populist right, who managed Trump's presidential campaign. That connection made Farage the first British politician to meet the then President-elect Trump, who suggested he should become the ambassador to Washington, and later urged the Conservatives to strike an election pact with the Brexit Party. Farage, for his part, suggested that Trump's peace initiative to North Korea merited a Nobel Peace Prize. Leader profiles Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Even after Bannon left the White House, Farage remained in contact with the president - one associate suspects they exchange direct messages via Twitter. But the influence of Bannon, critics say, was behind Farage's remark about Aids-infected immigrants in a televised election debate in 2015. He said Britain should not be spending money on health tourism, adding: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV, and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to Â£25,000 per year per patient. What we need to do is to put the NHS there for British people and families, who in many cases have paid into the system for decades."" Donald Trump greets Nigel Farage at the Mississippi Coliseum, Jackson, 2016 UKIP hit the big time when it topped the poll in the 2014 elections to the European Parliament. That attracted serious talent and serious money to the party - but it also exposed a major Farage flaw. He could sense on instinct when public opinion was moving, but he struggled to build an effective party organisation. There was a conflict between his insistence on maintaining control and his waning attention span when confronted with the endless detail and the endless trade-offs of building a political machine. This is where the wingmen became crucial - they would speak with his voice, and the words ""Nigel wants"" were usually decisive. But the wingmen could come and go, and the decisions relayed to the party could change with them. Sometimes the internal mantra was not ""what Nigel wants, Nigel gets,"" but ""Nigel is our greatest asset and our greatest liability"". Farage's frustration with those party machine issues shows in the design of the Brexit Party. Its chairman, the long term Farage ally, Richard Tice, compares it to a fast-growing tech start-up. Farage calls the shots, with no tiresome committees of stubborn party worthies to get in the way. That allows him to pivot to a new position with dizzying speed. UKIP could never have decided on a Monday afternoon to stand down 300 candidates, and just do it. It would have taken six months of infighting to get something like that through its internal structure. Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of the Brexit Party, Coventry, 2019 And, incidentally, his decision to abandon UKIP and set up an entirely new organisation gave the lie to his claims that it was not a one-man band. The ""left behind"" voters he had won for UKIP followed him, and his former party imploded in his wake. But is his magic fading? In 2015 UKIP attracted four million votes. But for this, they only got one MP - and it wasn't N Farage. In this election, insurgency has been harder. Brexit is the policy of the Conservative government, and that forces Farage into more nuanced arguments about its version of Brexit as opposed to his. At those election rallies he sounded much more comfortable bashing Remainers. Then there was his decision not to contest a Commons seat himself. Having failed to win the election in Eastleigh in 1994, Salisbury (1997), Bexhill and Battle (2001), South Thanet (2005 - his first attempt at the seat), Buckingham (2010) and finally South Thanet again in 2015, John Woodcock wonders if there might be a kind of glass ceiling to his appeal. ""It's interesting that someone with his star quality can't get elected, it gives me some solace about the instincts of the voters."" A plane carrying Nigel Farage crashed on the day of the 2010 general election when its UKIP-promoting banner became entangled in the tail fin In fairness, the other parties threw everything into their efforts to prevent Farage reaching Parliament in 2015, not least because he had pledged to resign as leader if he was not elected. His defeat was bruising and dispiriting, and he would have faced the same problems of fighting an intense constituency battle while also leading a national campaign, wherever he might have run this time. Another factor is that, until now, he has faced Conservative leaders who couldn't match his appeal to those Brexity, working-class and traditional Tory voters. John Major wanted to be at the heart of Europe, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard did toy with Farage-esque populism, but didn't convince. David Cameron was a liberal centrist, and Theresa May's initial ""Iron Lady"" appeal corroded rapidly. But Boris Johnson is a direct rival for the hearts and minds Farage had claimed as his own. ""Farage will say he thinks Johnson and Johnsonism are over-rated, but the reality is that he's now up against a charismatic politician who can match him,"" says one long-standing Brexit campaigner. An early sign was Farage's inability to pin the blame for the postponement of Brexit on the prime minister - part of the reason for that was that there wasn't a group of hard Brexit Conservative MPs willing to attack the government's new-look Brexit deal as BRINO (Brexit in Name Only). There's a parasitical co-dependent relationship between the Brexiteer Tory right and Farage. He does best when they're crying betrayal and amplifying his message to Conservative voters, that they've been let down by their leaders, once again. What next? Will he be able to revive the Brexit Party if there is no Brexit or an unsatisfactory Brexit? His decision to stand down Brexit Party candidates in Conservative seats infuriated some of his supporters, and provoked open rebellion among a few. It may be hard to get the band back together again. Despite his confident exterior, this is the first time Farage has found himself on the defensive, but he continues to insist that the Brexit Party is needed, although after the UK leaves, it might need to be re-branded. And John Woodcock is struck by the ""remarkable"" way the UKIP/Brexit Party electoral coalition has on occasion ""collapsed in on itself"" and then re-assembled, particularly for mid-term elections like those for the European Parliament. Nigel Farage campaigning in Plymouth, 2019 But before that, there's a general election. And even if the Brexit Party fails to gain a single seat, its intervention (or non-intervention) could tip the balance in hundreds of constituencies. Might an over-enthusiastic campaign actually prevent a Tory victory, lead on to a hung parliament and then to a second referendum? Farage's sense of ownership of Brexit is deeply, deeply personal, and makes it hard to let go, and stand aside to allow Boris Johnson to deliver it.  So could the man who spent 30 years in the wilderness arguing for Brexit ultimately be the man who stops it happening altogether? The question is whether he knows when to stop, or is even capable of stopping. There are, Farage-watchers say, two Nigels: Nice Nigel and Nasty Nigel. They reflect the fun, patriotic, Del Boy side of populism, and its angrier flipside - in other words, the charismatic, optimistic, Happy Warrior or the angry populist Dark Knight. And this election could still turn on which one emerges in this campaign. All photos subject to copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"Melania Geymonat (right) and her date Chris needed hospital treatment A group of boys who subjected two women on a bus to homophobic comments ""wanted to be shown how lesbians have sex"", a court was told. Melania Geymonat and Christine Hannigan were harassed and pelted with coins by the boys in north London on 30 May. Three boys, aged 15, 16 and 17,admitted public order offenceson Thursday. A judge ruled homophobia was behind the 17-year-old's involvement, after he had contested this. At Highbury Corner Youth Court, he was sentenced to a four-month youth rehabilitation order, a 20-hour reparation requirement, similar to community service, and a two-week curfew. The other two boys, who did not contest the prosecution's case, will be sentenced next month. Ms Hannigan had told the court they were targeted ""because of who they were"". She added: ""We were clearly together in a romantic sense, we were being affectionate. ""It is pretty intimidating being cornered and making homophobic comments. ""They wanted us to show them how lesbians have sex. They said 'show us' and I don't remember if it was on its own or part of a larger phrase but the words were said."" This video can not be played 'I was and still am angry at bus attack' When asked whether the teenagers were being aggressive or annoying, Ms Hannigan replied: ""I think they were being both. ""They were being extremely aggressive verbally and then they made it physical."" Defence solicitor David Wood said although the boy threw coins and made a kissing gesture at the couple, the action was not based on their sexual orientations. ""He was 17 and just being stupid,"" Mr Wood said. ""They have got over excited in a puerile, immature way over the fact that these women were in some sort of relationship."" Passing judgment, District Judge Susan Williams said: ""I am quite sure this was a hostile act. However, I also have to be sure that you were hostile because Ms Hannigan was a lesbian. ""In other words that you were picking on her because of who she was and not just fooling around. ""I have come to the short conclusion that is exactly what you were doing.""

"SNH will now pay to remove the fallen trees Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has apologised for killing more than 300 mature beech trees on an island in Loch Lomond. SNH said it should have consulted Inchtavannach Island's owners beforepoisoning the beech treeswith a chemical injection. SNH had agreed a ""selective felling"" of non-native trees on the island in 2013, but did not tell Luss Estates about the change of plan. It will pay to remove the fallen trees. Luss Estates previously said the island was left looking like a ""wasteland"" and accused SNH of creating a ""major eyesore in one of Scotland's foremost beauty spots"". The two parties have now reached an agreement in the long-running dispute. The beech trees were poisoned with a chemical injection SNH's David Maclennan said that Luss Estates had been party to the original management agreement in 2013 over the removal of rhododendron and the selective felling of non-native species over a five-year period. However, he said: ""Scottish Natural Heritage accepts that the subsequent amendment, which proposed to kill all the beech trees on Inchtavannach in a single operation by chemical injection of glyphosate was not shared with Luss Estates Company. ""SNH apologise for what was, with hindsight, an error on our part."" Mr McLennan said that SNH should have ensured that Luss Estates was informed of and consented to the proposed operations. Simon Miller of Luss Estates said: ""After nearly six years, we are pleased that SNH has apologised for the killing of the beech trees at Inchtavannach, and accept this gesture. ""SNH has now agreed, at its expense, to remove as much of the fallen timber as possible this year.""

"Witnesses described armed police arriving at the scene and shooting a man ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run'."" Mustafa Salih was behind the wheel of a bus heading towards London Bridge when he was ordered to join the crowds fleeing a sudden violent attack at one of the city's most well-known locations. That was the moment he realised the bridge had been targeted for the second time in three years. Mr Salih joined scores running from the scene wheretwo people had been stabbed to death and the suspected attacker shot dead by police. Just before 14:00 GMT bars and restaurants on the south side of the bridge had been filling up with tourists and office workers. In an instant that all changed - and London Bridge was in lockdown yet again. Mr Salih, 62, was travelling from Borough High Street when he saw a stream of people, including some in tears, running towards him. ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run',"" he said. ""I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. One woman was crying. It was all very scary as we did not know what was happening."" This video can not be played Video shows the moment before a man was apparently shot by police on London Bridge Nurse Jackie Bensfield, 32, described how she asked to be let off a bus on the bridge after she heard gunshots. Ms Bensfield, who was on her way home from work, said she got off the bus and ""ran like hell"" to escape the shots. Another witness, Connor Allen, who was in his van on the bridge at the time, said: ""Everyone just started running, you heard these pops and that was it. ""We just got out [of] the van and started running.""

""Then I heard this distant sound coming from the market direction,"" he said. ""There was one American couple who were separated from their daughter, they were obviously really scared. Afterwards the police came and told us to evacuate."" Juan Rios described hearing a sound like ""popcorn"" coming from the direction of Borough Market The bridge remains cordoned off, while nearby Borough Market has also been blocked off by officers and no-one is being allowed through towards the crime scene. Businesses have been evacuated of shoppers but there is a constant flow of police officers heading into - and out of - the cordon. London Bridge station was closed and restaurants and bars which had been filling up earlier - and would normally be a hive of activity on a Friday night - were empty. Workers are being allowed to leave down Borough High Street, but no-one is being allowed through towards the scene of the incident. Residents have been told to find elsewhere to stay as the police cordon remains in place around the London Bridge area. Meanwhile, the November night sky is lit up by blue flashing lights, and a helicopter continues to hover overhead. Shop worker David Lockwood was among those caught up in the incident. ""Most people were very calm, we have practised this after the last attack here two Junes ago,"" he said.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and
people in the UK can live and work in any EU countryâ, more than half the
respondentsto a ComRes survey carried out earlier this month,externalsupported the
idea â 31% strongly, 25% âsomewhatâ. (âNeither agree nor disagreeâ and âdonât knowâ were 11% and
10%). And a 2017 poll by YouGov,externalfor anti-Brexit campaign group
Best for Britain asked
about a plan that is effectively freedom of movement, without calling it that:
âThe right to travel, work, study or retire
in Britain, in exchange for EU countries giving British citizens the same
rights.â The results were 69% in favour and 13% against (and 19%
âdonât knowâ). But when the same survey asked the
same people how important reducing EU immigration was in Brexit negotiations,
70% said it was important in some way (15% said it was the most important
issue, 31% very important, 24% fairly important). So Ms Lucas is correct â but only
if, as she said, the question is asked in a specific way. BBC Radio 5 Live Another caller to BBC Radio 5 Live, Gary from Northern Ireland, says he was concerned that the debate didn't include any of the parties in his part of the country. He says Brexit is a major concern for people there, and so the outcome of this election is likely to be very significant. ""My wife shops in Donegal,"" he says. ""Sheâs concerned, is she going to get border checks on her
shopping?"" Gary says ""English people have a right to decide what their own destiny is"" but he says he doesn't think they understand the border issues. ""English people donât see the raw side of the north of
Ireland, how a wee chip can do so much damage,"" he says. ""And Brexit is a big chip between the communities."" If you didn't have time to watch or listen to the full seven-way debate earlier, you can still catch up with it now. It's available to viewon iPlayer here, or there's an audio versionon BBC Sounds. This video can not be played BBC Debate: 'Would you use nuclear weapons?' Party representatives are split on whether they would use nuclear weapons if the UK was under nuclear attack. Watch them respond to a question on the issue in the BBC debate. Party representatives are split on whether they would use nuclear weapons if the UK was under nuclear attack. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives main campaign messages and escaped relatively unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile in the party and beyond. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the anti and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the partyâs policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit partyâs Richard Tice provided some of the fiery moments which wonât have done either of them any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a âseismicâ event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labourâs record in government in Wales and the Green Partyâs Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an issue in the election campaign. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Well after they came off stage I think none of the seven participants will be hanging their heads in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to they be punching the air in victory. Essentially, everyone taking part got a fair crack of the whip. Reality Check The claim:Rishi Sunak said: ""We've decarbonised our economy faster than any other major economy in the world."" The verdict:A parliamentary report earlier this year noted that ""the UK has achieved greater decarbonisation than any other country in the G20"". So is Mr Sunak correct? Not entirely. The source of that claim in the parliamentary report is theLow Carbon Economy Index,external, published by PwC. It notes that the UK reduced the carbon intensity of its economy - the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted for each unit of economic output - by 3.7% on average between 2000 and 2018. That's the most impressive record in the G20 group of major nations. However, it's not just a Conservative achievement. For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008
crash and are only just now catching up.  This video can not be played General election 2019: Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate Politicians appearing on this evening's election special shared their plans to tackle security issues in the UK after the terror attack in London Bridge. The early focus was on the incident in the capital,which saw two people killed and the attacker shot dead. The politicians moved on to more robust discussions on topics including Brexit, the NHS and immigration. Read our full story on the seven-way debatehere.

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000
more nurses on our wards, 50m more GP appointments and new and upgraded
hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average
percentage increase in health spending â this investment would mean funding
going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the
years from 2010 â under the Conservatives in coalition government with the
Liberal Democrats - when it was between 1 and 2%. But it would be significantly
lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we
should be wasting Â£200bn on it.â Nicola Sturgeon says it would cost Â£200bn to replace the
UKâs Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland. But that relies on assumptions about costs stretching ahead
for several decades â it
is not Â£200bn spent (or saved) all at once. The SNPâs number comes from the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But
because those estimates are for decades from now, they make assumptions about
the future economy â so itâs impossible to be precise about the number. BBC political correspondent says... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He says Boris Johnson said we would leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", and do he cannot believe what he says now. Olivia says she was undecided but she was leaning towards the Lib Dems after tonight, although ""I never thought I would say it"". She says Jo Swinson seemed the most honest and what she said on climate change was positive.  Reality Check The claim:Jo Swinson said: ""Offshore wind is the cheapest electricity that you can now create, thanks to the Liberal Democrats supporting that technology when we ran the climate change department."" The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price. An auction in Septembersaw developers agree to sell power from their projects for less than Â£40 a megawatt hour - a record low price for offshore wind. Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson has pledged to make it easier to help struggling UK companies after Brexit, if the Tories win the general election. The PM said being free of EU rules on state aid would make it quicker to intervene, and bring in ""buy British"" guidelines for public bodies. He added that an Australian-style immigration system would be in place in place by 1 January, 2021. But Labour criticised the Tories' past record of supporting industry. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the prime minister's promise on state aid rules ""sticks in his throat"". He said the Conservatives had ""sat on their hands and used state aid as an excuse"" when refusing to intervene to save a steel works in his Teesside constituency in 2015. Business lobby group the Institute of Directors said the PM's proposals ""suggest a retreat away from free and open markets"" and would have ""clear implications"" for the UK's ability to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs said greater use of state aid to help firms in trouble would ""translate to veiled support for cronyism"". What are the EU rules about state aid? Live: Latest from the campaign trail Parties to be quizzed in seven-way election debate Earlier on Friday, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was hoping for another hung parliament, with her party holding the balance of power. Mr Johnson has guaranteed that if the Conservatives win a working majority, the UK will leave the EU by 31 January at the latest. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, free movement from the EU will continue for 11 months after Brexit during a transition period. Mr Johnson said a new Australian-style immigration system would be in place when the current rules end on 31 December 2020. Under this scheme, those applying to come to the UKwould be awarded pointsbased on professional and personal characteristics, similar to the existing system for non-EU nationals. The PM wanted to set out not just the timescale for leaving the EU but what he saw as the benefits of Brexit for voters While the Conservatives were once the party of free trade, Boris Johnson donned the cloak of protectionism by outlining a new post-brexit state aid regime. And he said public bodies would be encouraged to adopt a ""Buy British"" policy to boost local economies. Critics say these measures would impede attempts to strike a trade deal with the EU. Mr Johnson also declined to say that no-deal preparations would be stood down but expressed confidence a trade agreement would be struck by the end of next year. With Gisela Stuart standing next to him, politically Boris Johnson wants to highlight differences with Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, ""By lowering the number of unskilled immigrants, the system will remove a major force that puts a downward pressure on people's wages and reduce the overall level of immigration,"" Mr Johnson said. As part of what he said was a ""Brexit roadmap"" designed to show voters the benefits of leaving the EU, he said a re-elected Conservative government would take ""immediate steps"" to introduce new rules to take effect after the transition period is due to finish at the end of 2020. Former Labour MP Gisela Stuart said voting Conservative did ""not make me a Tory"" These would include a new state aid regime to help industries in trouble, scrapping VAT on sanitary products and promoting a ""buy British"" rule for public bodies to help farmers. The Conservatives say current EU rules on state aid are bureaucratic and inflexible, citing the difficulties the UK had in getting emergency financial for Tata Steel's UK business in 2012. The party said introducing a new UK state aid regime would allow decisions on whether and how to intervene to be taken within days, allowing a quicker response to economic downturns. The PM said his aim was not to bail out failing business but to ensure a ""level playing field"" for industry. Despite saying he was confident that a free trade agreement would be in place by the end of 2020 when the transition period ends. Mr Johnson added that he saw ""no reason to dismantle"" preparations for leaving the EU without a deal. He said the preparations - which included pledges of Â£2.1bn extra spending under Mr Johnson - were ""thoroughly useful"" in convincing the EU that the UK was ""in earnest"" about leaving. ""Many of those preparations will be extremely valuable as we come out of the EU arrangements anyway, so I think they are the right thing to have done and to keep in a state of readiness,"" he said. Mr Johnson said only a Conservative victory would lift the country out of its ""political morass"" and ""deliver the change that people voted for by getting Brexit done"". He also said: He was not ""running scared"" from an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil, which other party leaders have committed to He wanted to ""take the division out"" of social care funding by finding a cross-party solution which would ensure no one has to sell their home to pay for care His previous remarks that the monarchy was ""beyond reproach"", which followed Prince Andrew's BBC interview, referred to the Queen rather than the Royal Family as a whole He said it was ""inconceivable"" the party would bring back fox hunting and it intended to improve animal welfare after Brexit, including banning ""barbaric"" shark's fin soup Appearing alongside the PM, former Labour minister Gisela Stuart said she would be voting Conservative and urged other traditional Labour voters to do the same if they wanted to see Brexit delivered. Ms Stuart, who stood down at the 2017 election, was the most senior Labour figure in the Vote Leave referendum campaign. ""In this election, I will not vote for Jeremy Corbyn but I can vote for Brexit,"" she said. ""A vote for Boris Johnson this time around is a vote to get Brexit done, But let me be clear, voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future."" The Labour manifesto does not directly mention state aid, but the party has pledged to bring mail, rail, water and energy back into state ownership, and part-nationalise BT. Leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested he thinks EU rules could restrict the government's ability to intervene to support industry. Labour would keep free movement rules if the UK stays in the EU following its planned referendum, or otherwise ""seek to protect"" them if voters opt for its Brexit deal instead. The Brexit Party has vowed to cap permanent immigration into the UK at 50,000 a year. The Liberal Democrats want the UK to stay in the EU, meaning it would continue to follow existing rules on state aid and free movement.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and
people in the UK can live and work in any EU countryâ, more than half the
respondentsto a ComRes survey carried out earlier this month,externalsupported the
idea â 31% strongly, 25% âsomewhatâ. (âNeither agree nor disagreeâ and âdonât knowâ were 11% and
10%). And a 2017 poll by YouGov,externalfor anti-Brexit campaign group
Best for Britain asked
about a plan that is effectively freedom of movement, without calling it that:
âThe right to travel, work, study or retire
in Britain, in exchange for EU countries giving British citizens the same
rights.â The results were 69% in favour and 13% against (and 19%
âdonât knowâ). But when the same survey asked the
same people how important reducing EU immigration was in Brexit negotiations,
70% said it was important in some way (15% said it was the most important
issue, 31% very important, 24% fairly important). So Ms Lucas is correct â but only
if, as she said, the question is asked in a specific way. BBC Radio 5 Live Another caller to BBC Radio 5 Live, Gary from Northern Ireland, says he was concerned that the debate didn't include any of the parties in his part of the country. He says Brexit is a major concern for people there, and so the outcome of this election is likely to be very significant. ""My wife shops in Donegal,"" he says. ""Sheâs concerned, is she going to get border checks on her
shopping?"" Gary says ""English people have a right to decide what their own destiny is"" but he says he doesn't think they understand the border issues. ""English people donât see the raw side of the north of
Ireland, how a wee chip can do so much damage,"" he says. ""And Brexit is a big chip between the communities."" If you didn't have time to watch or listen to the full seven-way debate earlier, you can still catch up with it now. It's available to viewon iPlayer here, or there's an audio versionon BBC Sounds. This video can not be played BBC Debate: 'Would you use nuclear weapons?' Party representatives are split on whether they would use nuclear weapons if the UK was under nuclear attack. Watch them respond to a question on the issue in the BBC debate. Party representatives are split on whether they would use nuclear weapons if the UK was under nuclear attack. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives main campaign messages and escaped relatively unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile in the party and beyond. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the anti and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the partyâs policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit partyâs Richard Tice provided some of the fiery moments which wonât have done either of them any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a âseismicâ event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labourâs record in government in Wales and the Green Partyâs Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an issue in the election campaign. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Well after they came off stage I think none of the seven participants will be hanging their heads in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to they be punching the air in victory. Essentially, everyone taking part got a fair crack of the whip. Reality Check The claim:Rishi Sunak said: ""We've decarbonised our economy faster than any other major economy in the world."" The verdict:A parliamentary report earlier this year noted that ""the UK has achieved greater decarbonisation than any other country in the G20"". So is Mr Sunak correct? Not entirely. The source of that claim in the parliamentary report is theLow Carbon Economy Index,external, published by PwC. It notes that the UK reduced the carbon intensity of its economy - the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted for each unit of economic output - by 3.7% on average between 2000 and 2018. That's the most impressive record in the G20 group of major nations. However, it's not just a Conservative achievement. For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008
crash and are only just now catching up.

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000
more nurses on our wards, 50m more GP appointments and new and upgraded
hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average
percentage increase in health spending â this investment would mean funding
going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the
years from 2010 â under the Conservatives in coalition government with the
Liberal Democrats - when it was between 1 and 2%. But it would be significantly
lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we
should be wasting Â£200bn on it.â Nicola Sturgeon says it would cost Â£200bn to replace the
UKâs Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland. But that relies on assumptions about costs stretching ahead
for several decades â it
is not Â£200bn spent (or saved) all at once. The SNPâs number comes from the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But
because those estimates are for decades from now, they make assumptions about
the future economy â so itâs impossible to be precise about the number. BBC political correspondent says... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He says Boris Johnson said we would leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", and do he cannot believe what he says now. Olivia says she was undecided but she was leaning towards the Lib Dems after tonight, although ""I never thought I would say it"". She says Jo Swinson seemed the most honest and what she said on climate change was positive.  Reality Check The claim:Jo Swinson said: ""Offshore wind is the cheapest electricity that you can now create, thanks to the Liberal Democrats supporting that technology when we ran the climate change department."" The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price. An auction in Septembersaw developers agree to sell power from their projects for less than Â£40 a megawatt hour - a record low price for offshore wind. Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008
crash and are only just now catching up.

The early focus was on the incident in the capital,which saw two people killed and the attacker shot dead. The politicians moved on to more robust discussions on topics including Brexit, the NHS and immigration. Read our full story on the seven-way debatehere.

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000
more nurses on our wards, 50m more GP appointments and new and upgraded
hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average
percentage increase in health spending â this investment would mean funding
going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the
years from 2010 â under the Conservatives in coalition government with the
Liberal Democrats - when it was between 1 and 2%. But it would be significantly
lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we
should be wasting Â£200bn on it.â Nicola Sturgeon says it would cost Â£200bn to replace the
UKâs Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland. But that relies on assumptions about costs stretching ahead
for several decades â it
is not Â£200bn spent (or saved) all at once. The SNPâs number comes from the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But
because those estimates are for decades from now, they make assumptions about
the future economy â so itâs impossible to be precise about the number. BBC political correspondent says... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live listeners who say they were undecided before the debate call in to say whether any of the politicians swayed them. Ali says he is still undecided. He says we have two main candidates for prime minister and ""I don't trust either of them"". He says Boris Johnson said we would leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", and do he cannot believe what he says now. Olivia says she was undecided but she was leaning towards the Lib Dems after tonight, although ""I never thought I would say it"". She says Jo Swinson seemed the most honest and what she said on climate change was positive.  Reality Check The claim:Jo Swinson said: ""Offshore wind is the cheapest electricity that you can now create, thanks to the Liberal Democrats supporting that technology when we ran the climate change department."" The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price. An auction in Septembersaw developers agree to sell power from their projects for less than Â£40 a megawatt hour - a record low price for offshore wind. Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This year's Black Friday sale could break buying records in the UK, early figures suggest. At 10:00 GMT, Barclaycard said transaction volumes were up 12.5% from last year, and between 13:00 and 14:00 they were 9% higher. ""The fact that records are continuing to be broken suggests that appetite for Black Friday sales is not abating,"" said Rob Cameron from Barclaycard. John Lewis said buyers were snapping up Apple iPads and Lego Star Wars toys. The department store also reported interest in cut-price aftershave and underwear, as shoppers seek bargains for gifts. However, some of the most popular gifts are not being discounted, according to Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at Money.co.uk. Extinction Rebellion protested at the Black Friday sales at Oxford Circus over disposable fashion ""Consumers hoping to snap up one of this year's most popular gadgets today could be disappointed as our research found there are very few Black Friday deals to be had on the most sought-after products,"" he said. ""It begs the question, are stores discounting the products that shoppers really want, or slashing prices on the gear they have been unable to shift throughout the year? Black Friday: I feel guilty about how much I return Loan sharks cash in on Black Friday spending spree The website's research found discounts on products such as the Nintendo Switch gaming console and GoPro digital cameras were hard to come by at big retailers. The shopping spree has also suffered a backlash from campaigners concerned that it encourages wasteful impulse buying. Earlier this week,consumer group Which? warned that few real deals were available, with most goods cheaper or available for the same price at other times.

"The owner of the Daily Mail, DMGT, has bought the i newspaper and website for Â£49.6m from JPI Media. DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said the paper was ""a highly respected publication with a loyal and engaged readership"". ""We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high-quality and politically independent editorial style."" The Competition and Markets Authority will have to approve the deal. In 2018, the i reported an operating profit of Â£11m from Â£34m in sales. The deal means that the paper will have its fourth owner in as many years. The sale was attacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said in a tweet that two billionaires now owned half the UK's top 10 daily newspapers. Allow Twitter content?

The i was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to the Independent. It sells for 65p on weekdays and Â£1.20 on Saturdays. When it first hit the newsstands, executives at the company said it was aimed at ""time-poor newspaper readers"", especially commuters, who lacked the time to read a quality newspaper on a regular basis. At its launch, it shared the same editorial staff as its sister paper and was seen as a way of extending the Independent's brand to a new market. But in 2016, the Independent closed its print edition and the i was sold for Â£24m to Johnston Press. Despite this, links to the paper's former parent remained, with the i continuing to provide a print home for some of the Independent's now otherwise digital-only content. In November 2018, the i changed hands again after Johnston Press was bought out of administration by JPI Media. DMGT had been mulling the purchase for at least a year, but was beaten by JPI Media's deal with administrators. Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK with a history dating back more than 250 years, but it had debts of Â£220m. The deal leaves JPI with The Scotsman and Yorkshire Post among its biggest titles. In total, it owns about 200 newspaper brands. If the DMGT deal is approved, the UK's national newspapers will be owned by just six companies. DMGTalready owns the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro.

"Brad Gobright fell around 300 metres to his death A world-renowned American free solo climber has died attempting to descend the side of a cliff face. Brad Gobright, 31, fell around 300m (1,000ft) to his death in El Potrero Chico in northern Mexico. His companion, fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, fell a shorter distance and survived with injuries. Gobright was best known for free soloing, or climbing without any safety gear, but at the time the two were abseiling, a technique using ropes. Abseiling accidents are believed to be the most common cause of fatalities in the sport. The two men were simul-rappelling - a technique where two climbers descend opposite strands of an anchored rope, with their bodies acting as counterweights to each other - with an 80m rope, the Outside website reports. ""We started rapping,"" Mr Jacobson told the Outside website,,externalusing the North American term for abseiling. ""I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."" This video can not be played Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds speed climbing El Capitan in 2017 While Mr Jacobson crashed through a bush, which cushioned his fall, before striking a ledge, Gobright fell to his death. ""It was basically a blur,"" Mr Jacobson added. ""He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge."" Born in California in 1988, Gobright first started climbing at the age of six. He reportedly dropped out of an Orange County community college in 2009 and worked odd jobs to fund his climbs around North America, before his talent began to attract sponsorship deals. ""I always worked for four months, climbed for eight, and started over,""he told Rock and Ice magazine for a 2017 profile,external. Tributes to Gobright, who once held the coveted speed record on the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, have come in from across the climbing world. Jim Reynolds, who set that speed record with Gobright, wrote on Instagram:""We will carry your spirit, dear friend."",external ""The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,"" said Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. ""You will be dearly missed,""Free Solo director Jimmy Chin wrote on social media,external, calling Gobright ""a true climber's climber"". ""He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I've ever met,"" wrote Alice Hafer, one of Gobright's climbing partners. ""He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me."" It is unclear exactly what happened that caused Gobright to fall. But a Reddit climbing forum discussed the dangers of rappelling in the wake of Gobright's death, posting statistics which suggestmore than a quarter of climbing accidents in North America happen during the descent,external. ""It feels like it's always rappelling... it's not over till you're on the ground folks,"" wrote one commenter. Another said climbers can ""let their guard down"" after a long and tiring day, or become distracted in the rush to get down before the sun sets.

"IT problems experienced by NatWest account holders on Friday have been resolved, the bank has said. The High Street bank said there had been a glitch affecting mobile and online transactions throughout the day. Friday was payday for some customers, and many were seeking out Black Friday offers. ""All our services are now operating as normal. We apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused,"" a NatWest spokesperson said. The bank said debit cards, credit cards, ATMs, telephone and branch banking services had not been affected. However the inability to transfer money between accounts caused problems for some including asthmatic Tim Pitman who moved money hoping to pay for a prescription. The 49-year-old singer, from Glastonbury, said he had to borrow money from a friend to pay at the chemist, which was a 15-minute drive away. He said NatWest should have been clearer with customers who were affected. Some of those customers include people hoping to get a deal during Black Friday promotions. Allow Twitter content?

"Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders A man who stabbed two people to death and wounded three others in a ""terror-related"" attack was shot dead by police on London Bridge after he was held down by members of the public. Usman Khan, 28, had been released from jail on licence in 2018, half-way through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences. Cambridge University graduates Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed in the attack. Messages of condolences left at London Bridge Jack Merritt, studied law at the University of Manchester before going to Cambridge to continue his studies. Saskia Jones, was from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and both were involved in a university prisoner rehabilitation programme at Cambridge University. Mr Merritt, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, was a co-ordinator and Ms Jones a volunteer, the Met Police said. They were attacked during a conference being held on Friday afternoon at Fishmongers' Hall, at the north end of London Bridge. Saskia Jones was killed in the London Bridge attack The family of Ms Jones paid tribute to her as a ""positive influence at the centre of many people's lives"". Ms Jones' former university tutor Colleen Moore told BBC Breakfast: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment"" to the scheme,known as Learning Together, according to people who worked with him. His father David Merritt said his son was ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog"". A member of university staff was also among the three people injured. Two of those, both of them women, remain in a stable condition in hospital, according to police. Fishmongers Hall, below London Bridge Khan's attack began at 13:58 GMT inside Fishmongers' Hall. Fishmonger Company chief executive Toby Williamson said staff who fought Khan as he launched his attack believed he was wearing a bomb. He described the scene inside the hall as a game of ""pinball bomb with added knives"". He said one staff member in the hall's reception tried in vain to hold Khan back behind doors while another calmly placed a call to emergency services. Mr Williamson said two men used chairs, fire extinguishers, a pole and a narwhal tusk, which was hanging on the wall, to fend off Khan after he broke through the doors, driving him out of the building. One of those called Lukasz, a Polish national who was working as a porter in the hall's basement, suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a pole during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger, Mr Williamson said. Lukasz was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been able to return home. This video can not be played London Bridge attack: 'Pinball bomb with added knives' Khan was forced out of Fishmongers' Hall by a group of men - with hall staff joined by participants of the Learning Together conference - said to include ex-prisoners, probation and prison staff. Two men can be seen in a video holding the attacker back using a whale tusk, seized from a wall mount, and a fire extinguisher spray, before others stepped in to pin him down. In a second video a man is seen walking away holding a large knife they had retrieved. British Transport Police said later he was a plain clothes officer. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Metropolitan Police said its armed officers arrived on the scene within five minutes of the initial 999 call. The people holding Khan down were moved away by the armed police officers after they thought he was wearing a suicide vest under his jacket. Families lead tributes to London attack victims 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker 'Turn off your engine, get out and run' He was then shot by an officer. The Met's assistant commissioner said the explosive vest which turned out to be a hoax looked ""very convincing"". Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Basu said Khan was released from jail in December 2018. He had beenconvicted in 2012after plotting with a group from Stoke-on-Trent, London and Cardiff. Theydiscussed attacking the London Stock Exchangeand pubs in Stoke, and setting up a jihadist training camp in Pakistan. Usman Khan was photographed in 2008 One of the conditions of his release was that he should wear an electronic tag. He also had to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme, the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. The Parole Board said it had no involvement in his release from jail. Usman Khan had spent yearspreaching in Stokeand had links to the banned organisation al-Muhajiroun. Usman Khan (fourth from the left), pictured in Roath Park, Cardiff on 7 November 2010 An urgent review of the licence conditions of people jailed for terror offenceshas been launchedby the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). It confirmed the number of offenders convicted of terrorism offences who are currently under supervision in the community is 74. In a Twitter response to Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was murdered, Jack Merritt's father said: ""I obviously don't have full facts about the process that led to the attacker being released but what I can say with certainty is that no one at the event had the slightest inkling that he could or would do something like this. ""We don't need knee-jerk reactions."" Hundreds attended the vigil in Cambridge Avigil was held at the Guildhall Yard in London and outside the Guildhall in Cambridgeon Monday. Prayers have also been said at Southwark Cathedral for Mr Merritt and Ms Jones. The Dean, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said the incident had brought back memories of the 2017 attack. Officers removed items from the house in Stafford Officers have been carrying out two searches; in Stafford where Khan is believed to have lived, and in Stoke-on-Trent. Mr Basu said police were going through at least 500 images and videos sent to them. Police patrols across London have been increased as a result of the attack. The Queen sent ""thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones"" on behalf of herself and Prince Philip.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and

Best for Britain asked
about a plan that is effectively freedom of movement, without calling it that:
âThe right to travel, work, study or retire
in Britain, in exchange for EU countries giving British citizens the same
rights.â The results were 69% in favour and 13% against (and 19%
âdonât knowâ). But when the same survey asked the
same people how important reducing EU immigration was in Brexit negotiations,
70% said it was important in some way (15% said it was the most important
issue, 31% very important, 24% fairly important). So Ms Lucas is correct â but only
if, as she said, the question is asked in a specific way. BBC Radio 5 Live Another caller to BBC Radio 5 Live, Gary from Northern Ireland, says he was concerned that the debate didn't include any of the parties in his part of the country. He says Brexit is a major concern for people there, and so the outcome of this election is likely to be very significant. ""My wife shops in Donegal,"" he says. ""Sheâs concerned, is she going to get border checks on her
shopping?"" Gary says ""English people have a right to decide what their own destiny is"" but he says he doesn't think they understand the border issues. ""English people donât see the raw side of the north of
Ireland, how a wee chip can do so much damage,"" he says. ""And Brexit is a big chip between the communities.""

For Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labourâs record in government in Wales and the Green Partyâs Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an issue in the election campaign.

Essentially, everyone taking part got a fair crack of the whip. Reality Check The claim:Rishi Sunak said: ""We've decarbonised our economy faster than any other major economy in the world."" The verdict:A parliamentary report earlier this year noted that ""the UK has achieved greater decarbonisation than any other country in the G20"". So is Mr Sunak correct? Not entirely. The source of that claim in the parliamentary report is theLow Carbon Economy Index,external, published by PwC. It notes that the UK reduced the carbon intensity of its economy - the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted for each unit of economic output - by 3.7% on average between 2000 and 2018. That's the most impressive record in the G20 group of major nations. However, it's not just a Conservative achievement. For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000

hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average

going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the

lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we

Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But

Reality Check The claim:Jo Swinson said: ""Offshore wind is the cheapest electricity that you can now create, thanks to the Liberal Democrats supporting that technology when we ran the climate change department."" The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price. An auction in Septembersaw developers agree to sell power from their projects for less than Â£40 a megawatt hour - a record low price for offshore wind. Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders A man who stabbed two people to death and wounded three others in a ""terror-related"" attack was shot dead by police on London Bridge after he was held down by members of the public. Usman Khan, 28, had been released from jail on licence in 2018, half-way through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences. Cambridge University graduates Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed in the attack. Messages of condolences left at London Bridge Jack Merritt, studied law at the University of Manchester before going to Cambridge to continue his studies. Saskia Jones, was from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and both were involved in a university prisoner rehabilitation programme at Cambridge University. Mr Merritt, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, was a co-ordinator and Ms Jones a volunteer, the Met Police said. They were attacked during a conference being held on Friday afternoon at Fishmongers' Hall, at the north end of London Bridge. Saskia Jones was killed in the London Bridge attack The family of Ms Jones paid tribute to her as a ""positive influence at the centre of many people's lives"". Ms Jones' former university tutor Colleen Moore told BBC Breakfast: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment"" to the scheme,known as Learning Together, according to people who worked with him. His father David Merritt said his son was ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog"". A member of university staff was also among the three people injured. Two of those, both of them women, remain in a stable condition in hospital, according to police. Fishmongers Hall, below London Bridge Khan's attack began at 13:58 GMT inside Fishmongers' Hall. Fishmonger Company chief executive Toby Williamson said staff who fought Khan as he launched his attack believed he was wearing a bomb. He described the scene inside the hall as a game of ""pinball bomb with added knives"". He said one staff member in the hall's reception tried in vain to hold Khan back behind doors while another calmly placed a call to emergency services. Mr Williamson said two men used chairs, fire extinguishers, a pole and a narwhal tusk, which was hanging on the wall, to fend off Khan after he broke through the doors, driving him out of the building. One of those called Lukasz, a Polish national who was working as a porter in the hall's basement, suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a pole during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger, Mr Williamson said. Lukasz was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been able to return home. This video can not be played London Bridge attack: 'Pinball bomb with added knives' Khan was forced out of Fishmongers' Hall by a group of men - with hall staff joined by participants of the Learning Together conference - said to include ex-prisoners, probation and prison staff. Two men can be seen in a video holding the attacker back using a whale tusk, seized from a wall mount, and a fire extinguisher spray, before others stepped in to pin him down. In a second video a man is seen walking away holding a large knife they had retrieved. British Transport Police said later he was a plain clothes officer. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Metropolitan Police said its armed officers arrived on the scene within five minutes of the initial 999 call. The people holding Khan down were moved away by the armed police officers after they thought he was wearing a suicide vest under his jacket. Families lead tributes to London attack victims 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker 'Turn off your engine, get out and run' He was then shot by an officer. The Met's assistant commissioner said the explosive vest which turned out to be a hoax looked ""very convincing"". Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Basu said Khan was released from jail in December 2018. He had beenconvicted in 2012after plotting with a group from Stoke-on-Trent, London and Cardiff. Theydiscussed attacking the London Stock Exchangeand pubs in Stoke, and setting up a jihadist training camp in Pakistan. Usman Khan was photographed in 2008 One of the conditions of his release was that he should wear an electronic tag. He also had to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme, the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. The Parole Board said it had no involvement in his release from jail. Usman Khan had spent yearspreaching in Stokeand had links to the banned organisation al-Muhajiroun. Usman Khan (fourth from the left), pictured in Roath Park, Cardiff on 7 November 2010 An urgent review of the licence conditions of people jailed for terror offenceshas been launchedby the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). It confirmed the number of offenders convicted of terrorism offences who are currently under supervision in the community is 74. In a Twitter response to Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was murdered, Jack Merritt's father said: ""I obviously don't have full facts about the process that led to the attacker being released but what I can say with certainty is that no one at the event had the slightest inkling that he could or would do something like this. ""We don't need knee-jerk reactions."" Hundreds attended the vigil in Cambridge Avigil was held at the Guildhall Yard in London and outside the Guildhall in Cambridgeon Monday. Prayers have also been said at Southwark Cathedral for Mr Merritt and Ms Jones. The Dean, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said the incident had brought back memories of the 2017 attack. Officers removed items from the house in Stafford Officers have been carrying out two searches; in Stafford where Khan is believed to have lived, and in Stoke-on-Trent. Mr Basu said police were going through at least 500 images and videos sent to them. Police patrols across London have been increased as a result of the attack. The Queen sent ""thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones"" on behalf of herself and Prince Philip.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and
people in the UK can live and work in any EU countryâ, more than half the

The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price.

Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and
people in the UK can live and work in any EU countryâ, more than half the
respondentsto a ComRes survey carried out earlier this month,externalsupported the
idea â 31% strongly, 25% âsomewhatâ. (âNeither agree nor disagreeâ and âdonât knowâ were 11% and
10%). And a 2017 poll by YouGov,externalfor anti-Brexit campaign group
Best for Britain asked
about a plan that is effectively freedom of movement, without calling it that:
âThe right to travel, work, study or retire
in Britain, in exchange for EU countries giving British citizens the same
rights.â The results were 69% in favour and 13% against (and 19%
âdonât knowâ). But when the same survey asked the
same people how important reducing EU immigration was in Brexit negotiations,
70% said it was important in some way (15% said it was the most important
issue, 31% very important, 24% fairly important). So Ms Lucas is correct â but only
if, as she said, the question is asked in a specific way. BBC Radio 5 Live Another caller to BBC Radio 5 Live, Gary from Northern Ireland, says he was concerned that the debate didn't include any of the parties in his part of the country. He says Brexit is a major concern for people there, and so the outcome of this election is likely to be very significant. ""My wife shops in Donegal,"" he says. ""Sheâs concerned, is she going to get border checks on her
shopping?"" Gary says ""English people have a right to decide what their own destiny is"" but he says he doesn't think they understand the border issues. ""English people donât see the raw side of the north of
Ireland, how a wee chip can do so much damage,"" he says. ""And Brexit is a big chip between the communities.""

Watch them respond to a question on the issue in the BBC debate. Party representatives are split on whether they would use nuclear weapons if the UK was under nuclear attack. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives main campaign messages and escaped relatively unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile in the party and beyond. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the anti and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the partyâs policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit partyâs Richard Tice provided some of the fiery moments which wonât have done either of them any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a âseismicâ event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labourâs record in government in Wales and the Green Partyâs Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an issue in the election campaign. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Well after they came off stage I think none of the seven participants will be hanging their heads in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to they be punching the air in victory. Essentially, everyone taking part got a fair crack of the whip. Reality Check The claim:Rishi Sunak said: ""We've decarbonised our economy faster than any other major economy in the world."" The verdict:A parliamentary report earlier this year noted that ""the UK has achieved greater decarbonisation than any other country in the G20"". So is Mr Sunak correct? Not entirely. The source of that claim in the parliamentary report is theLow Carbon Economy Index,external, published by PwC. It notes that the UK reduced the carbon intensity of its economy - the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted for each unit of economic output - by 3.7% on average between 2000 and 2018. That's the most impressive record in the G20 group of major nations. However, it's not just a Conservative achievement. For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008
crash and are only just now catching up.

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000
more nurses on our wards, 50m more GP appointments and new and upgraded
hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average
percentage increase in health spending â this investment would mean funding
going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the
years from 2010 â under the Conservatives in coalition government with the
Liberal Democrats - when it was between 1 and 2%. But it would be significantly
lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we
should be wasting Â£200bn on it.â Nicola Sturgeon says it would cost Â£200bn to replace the
UKâs Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland. But that relies on assumptions about costs stretching ahead
for several decades â it
is not Â£200bn spent (or saved) all at once. The SNPâs number comes from the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But
because those estimates are for decades from now, they make assumptions about
the future economy â so itâs impossible to be precise about the number. BBC political correspondent says... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A former MP is to receive compensation and costs from the Metropolitan Police of nearly Â£900,000 over the force's disastrous investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring. Harvey Proctor, an ex-Tory politician, had his home raided following claims by fantasist Carl Beech. Mr Proctor, 72, said he would now attempt to repair his ""damaged life in the years that are left to me"". The Met confirmed a settlement was reached late on Thursday evening. Mr Proctor will receive Â£500,000 in compensation and nearly Â£400,000 towards legal fees from Scotland Yard. Operation Midland, which began in 2014, saw dawn raids on the homes of Mr Proctor, D-day veteran Lord Bramall -who died earlier this month, and the late Lord Brittan, following a series of allegations that turned out to be lies. Beech - then known as ""Nick"" - falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 1980s by members of a VIP paedophile ring. Carl Beech: Liar, fraudster and paedophile Judge suggests he was 'misled' over abuse warrants Ex-MP wants action on police who 'misled' judge Home secretary orders VIP abuse inquiry review He is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. During Beech's trial in June, Mr Proctor told of the impactthe allegations had on his life. He said media interest following the police raid led to him losing his job and deciding to leave the UK to live in Spain for his own safety. The payout is believed to be by far the biggest in relation to Operation Midland. In 2017, the forcewas reported to have paidLord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan Â£100,000 each. A statement from Mr Proctor and his lawyers said the settlement was also believed to be the largest ever made by a British police force for negligent behaviour, other than in cases where the victim had been imprisoned. Mr Proctor said he had been advised that he could receive more compensation by going to court. However, he said: ""I am heartily sick of these police and their mealy-mouthed apologies to me and I did not want to take a fortune from public funds. ""Just enough to put my innocence beyond doubt, and to warn police not to make this same mistake with other people."" Mark Stephens, one of Mr Proctor's lawyers, said the case was about a ""vindication of Harvey Proctor"" as well as repairing the ""real losses"" he experienced. As the only surviving figure who was wrongly accused by Beech, Mr Proctor said he also spoke ""for the those whose voices have been stilled"". ""It will take a very long time, if ever, for me to personally have confidence in the Metropolitan Police Service,"" he added. The Met was heavily criticised over Operation Midland in an independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. He reprimanded the force for believing Beech for too long, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald for announcing publicly that Beech's claims were ""credible and true"", and officers for applying for search warrants with flawed information and for failing to close the investigation sooner. Confirmation of the settlement came after Mr Proctor announced he had reported five former Met officers to Northumbria Police in a bid to spark a fresh inquiry into the investigation. Northumbria referred his complaint back to Scotland Yard, which said it was still assessing it.

"An archaic law policing women's behaviour was repealed and the party of the former regime was dissolved Sudan has repealed a restrictive public order law that controlled how women acted and dressed in public. On Twitter, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok paid tribute to women who had ""endured the atrocities that resulted from the implementation of this law"". The country's transitional authorities also dissolved the party of former President Omar al-Bashir. Mr Bashir seized power in a 1989 coup and ruled for nearly 30 years before peaceful protests ousted him in April. Sudan is currently led by a joint military and civilian council, as well as a civilian-led cabinet headed by Prime Minister Hamdok. Allow Twitter content?

Both the repeal of the public order law and dissolution of the National Congress Party (NCP) were a response to key demands of the protest movement, which aims to dismantle Mr Bashir's regime. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Khartoum overnight at news of the moves. Sudan's revolutionaries pin hopes on new PM Thousands demand justice for Sudan protesters Africa Live: More on this and other stories Aisha Musa, one of two women on Sudan's new Sovereign Council, told BBC Newsday that while the former regime had focused on how women dressed and acted - including preventing women from wearing trousers - it had ignored their education and healthcare. ""It is about time that all this corruption stops, that all this treatment for the women of Sudan stops,"" she said. A 2017 report by two charities described the restrictions,externalas a blend of legal and moral prohibitions ""designed to exclude and intimidate women from actively participating in public life"". They gave the authorities sweeping powers to arbitrarily control what women wore, whom they spoke to and saw, and any job they might hold - with any perceived offender facing punishment by flogging, or in rare cases stoning and even execution. Moreover, the public order rules were kept ""vague and open-ended leaving them open to exploitation as a social control tool by the authorities,"" the report said. The women driving change in Sudan Why this woman became symbolic to Sudanese protesters 'Sudanese women have always been in the frontlines' Human rights activist Hala al-Karib told BBC Newsday that repealing the law was a ""massive step"" for her country, arguing the legislation had enforced the old regime's ideology, which was ""based in terror and discrimination"". Authorities had had the power to ""literally hunt women"", she said, and these laws had disproportionately affected poorer women, women from conflict zones and people outside Khartoum. But while she welcomed the end of the law, Ms Karib said more needed to be done to end ""a very discriminatory legal framework"". This video can not be played Ahlam Khidir, a grieving mother and one of the movement's most prominent figures Women were at the forefront of the movement that toppled Mr Bashir. Throughout the demonstrations women were visible on the frontlines, demanding greater freedoms for themselves and their country. ""We need a fair and just country. We have suffered a lot. More than men in many cases. Women should be at the centre of any government,""one activist told Al Jazeera news agency in April,external. One 22-year-old studentAlaa Salah became an icon for demonstratorsafter a video of her leading chants against the former leader went viral, earning her the nickname ""Nubian Queen"". On 25 November, Sudan held its first march in decades for the International Day for Eliminating Violence Against Women. By James Copnall, BBC News, Sudan analyst The decision to revoke the Public Order Law is a momentous step. The authorities used it in particular to control women. Some received 40 lashes for wearing trousers in public. The way the law was applied underlined the divisions and tensions within Sudanese society. In recent years it was common to see rich Khartoum women wearing trousers in public - while those targeted by the morality police were often poorer women from the marginalised areas on the periphery of this vast country. The NCP, meanwhile, was a colossus, the political vehicle for a regime which tried to reshape every part of Sudanese life - and cracked down extremely hard on anybody who disagreed. The authorities hope that dismantling the NCP will help stop the old regime from undermining the transitional government. There is a certain irony about a transitional government set up to move the country to democracy banning a political party. But nobody other than its partisans will mourn the NCP, which is blamed for creating so much misery. Those who led the protests - and women's rights activists in particular - are celebrating the demise of the NCP and the law, even if they recognise this is just the start of a longer struggle to transform Sudan. Dissolving Mr Bashir's National Congress Party (NCP) means that the authorities can seize the party's assets. The decree confirmed that a committee would be formed to do this. This, Mr Hamdok tweeted, was so they could ""retrieve the stolen wealth of the people of Sudan"". The decree also said ""none of the symbols of the regime or party would be allowed to engage in any political activity for 10 years"". The changes announced by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok meet key demands of the protesters A spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, the protest group that toppled Mr Bashir, told the BBC this was ""a historic moment"". ""This is a moment of relief, because each and every person in Sudan has been affected in some way or the other by this regime in a negative manner,"" spokeswoman Samahir Mubarak said. But the NCP condemned the move as ""nothing more than a moral scandal, an act of intellectual bankruptcy and a total failure on the part of the illegal government"". ""The party is not bothered by any law or decision issued against it as the NCP is a strong party and its ideas will prevail,"" a post on the party's Facebook page read. The unrest in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when the Bashir government imposed emergency austerity measures. Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards, and the anger spread to the capital. The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years. In April, the president was overthrown by the military after sit-ins outside the defence ministry, but demonstrators then wanted to ensure authority was swiftly transferred to a civilian administration. A transitional government which came to power in August has vowed to reunite the country.

"Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo murdered his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow in a ""brutal and evil attack"" has been jailed. Sana Muhammad, 35, was shot in the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her Ilford home on 12 November, 2018. He hid in the shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard. Unmathallegadoo, 51, was jailed for life with a minimum of 33 years. Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child - survived the attack and was delivered by Caesarean section, the court heard. Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was nine months pregnant when she was killed On the morning of November 12, the defendant, armed with two crossbows, was disturbed by Mrs Muhammad's husband Imtiaz, who had gone to the shed to store a box. Unmathallegadoo ran into the house and shot his ex-wife with an 18-inch arrow as she fled upstairs. Judge Mark Lucraft QC described the killing as ""brutal and evil"", saying if it was not for the presence of her children, Unmathallegadoo would have shot Mr Muhammad too. Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo had been plotting the attack for weeks - buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018. ""You have carefully planned this attack. You had two loaded crossbows and I'm entirely satisfied you intended an attack on Sana and then on Imtiaz,"" the judge said. ""One can only assume that you were jealous of their life together and the fact that they had formed a loving bond between themselves and with your children."" Mrs Muhammad's widower previously paid tribute to his outgoing ""soul mate"". ""She was very friendly, talkative and always made me laugh. She was my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly. ""Ram must have been very jealous of the life Sana and I had and that we were living a happy life."" A jury rejected the defendant's claim he fired the crossbow by accident and found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations The court heard the victim was 16 when she entered into an arranged marriage with the defendant, then aged 30, in Mauritius. Their relationship ended in 2012 after an incident where she jumped from an upstairs window and broke her ankle. Mrs Muhammed filed for an order which banned the defendant from going within 100 metres of her home. It was still in place at the time of the attack.

"Brad Gobright fell around 300 metres to his death A world-renowned American free solo climber has died attempting to descend the side of a cliff face. Brad Gobright, 31, fell around 300m (1,000ft) to his death in El Potrero Chico in northern Mexico. His companion, fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, fell a shorter distance and survived with injuries. Gobright was best known for free soloing, or climbing without any safety gear, but at the time the two were abseiling, a technique using ropes. Abseiling accidents are believed to be the most common cause of fatalities in the sport. The two men were simul-rappelling - a technique where two climbers descend opposite strands of an anchored rope, with their bodies acting as counterweights to each other - with an 80m rope, the Outside website reports. ""We started rapping,"" Mr Jacobson told the Outside website,,externalusing the North American term for abseiling. ""I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."" This video can not be played Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds speed climbing El Capitan in 2017 While Mr Jacobson crashed through a bush, which cushioned his fall, before striking a ledge, Gobright fell to his death. ""It was basically a blur,"" Mr Jacobson added. ""He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge."" Born in California in 1988, Gobright first started climbing at the age of six. He reportedly dropped out of an Orange County community college in 2009 and worked odd jobs to fund his climbs around North America, before his talent began to attract sponsorship deals. ""I always worked for four months, climbed for eight, and started over,""he told Rock and Ice magazine for a 2017 profile,external. Tributes to Gobright, who once held the coveted speed record on the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, have come in from across the climbing world. Jim Reynolds, who set that speed record with Gobright, wrote on Instagram:""We will carry your spirit, dear friend."",external ""The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,"" said Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. ""You will be dearly missed,""Free Solo director Jimmy Chin wrote on social media,external, calling Gobright ""a true climber's climber"". ""He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I've ever met,"" wrote Alice Hafer, one of Gobright's climbing partners. ""He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me."" It is unclear exactly what happened that caused Gobright to fall. But a Reddit climbing forum discussed the dangers of rappelling in the wake of Gobright's death, posting statistics which suggestmore than a quarter of climbing accidents in North America happen during the descent,external. ""It feels like it's always rappelling... it's not over till you're on the ground folks,"" wrote one commenter. Another said climbers can ""let their guard down"" after a long and tiring day, or become distracted in the rush to get down before the sun sets.

"Carmarthenshire council said 193 pupils at Ysgol Bro Myrddin are off sick with a stomach bug Nearly 200 pupils at a Carmarthen secondary school are off sick with suspected norovirus. Carmarthenshire council confirmed 193 of the 893 pupils at Ysgol Bro Myrddin have stayed home. The school asked parents to ensure affected children do not return within 48 hours of sickness, after seeking advice from Public Health Wales (PHW). PHW said investigations were ongoing into the source and cause of the illness but norovirus is suspected. SiÃ´n Lingard, consultant in health protection for PHW, said: ""Norovirus has typical symptoms of sudden onset of profuse vomiting and/or diarrhoea, but in most people it is self-limiting and subsides within 72 hours."" He advised people who are unwell to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before preparing food, and not to share towels with others.

"Robert Pugh denies 10 other charges of indecent assault against three boys A former climbing instructor has been found not guilty of three charges of historical child abuse. A judge directed the jury to find Robert Pugh not guilty of the allegations due to a lack of evidence. Mr Pugh, 75, of Cardiff, still faces 10 other charges of indecent assault of three boys at Storey Arms Outdoor Activity Centre in the Brecon Beacons during the 1980s and 1990s. He denies all the charges at Cardiff Crown Court. All three victims allege they were under the age of 16 when Mr Pugh started abusing them at the outdoor pursuits centre. The court heard they were subjected to a ""pattern of abuse"" where ""each allege Mr Pugh tried to touch their genitals either over or under their sleeping bags"". One of the boys alleged he was ""petrified"" when asked to share a tent with Mr Pugh on a camping trip and was taken to a pub and given beer, despite only being 15. The jury heard the third man came forward after media reports of the trial earlier this year. The prosecution said this complainant was also taken to a pub regularly and was forced to share a double bed with Mr Pugh during a skiing trip, when he tried to touch his genitals in the night. Storey Arms Outdoor Activity Centre at the foot of Pen-y-Fan has been part of Cardiff council's education service since 1971 Mr Pugh, who specialised in mountaineering, told the jury children came to the centre through their schools and those with ""significant enthusiasm"" were invited back for further courses. He said he remembered all three boys said there had never been any animosity with any of the complainants and witnesses in the trial.Â He did not remember the one boy staying overnight in a tent. Defending Hillary Roberts asked: ""He alleges you tried to grope him, did anything like that ever happen?"" Mr Pugh replied: ""Nothing, no"". Boy 'repeatedly assaulted by climbing instructor' Boy 'shared tent with abuser for free holiday' Abuse-accused 'forced boys to share tent' He said after the trip, he had no further contact with the boy until the allegations emerged. Mr Pugh told the jury he would occasionally knock on the door of the second boy, who was assisting staff at the Storey Arms centre, as a ""wake-up call"" but he did not remember going into the room and sitting on his bed.Â Ms Roberts asked: ""Did you ever make an attempt to grab his groin area?"" Mr Pugh replied ""certainly not"". Mr Pugh said he did not remember if the boy travelled in his car on a foreign trip but said he was sure they had never shared a tent and he never made any attempt to grab him in any way. In regards to the third boy, Mr Pugh told the court it was ""just untrue"" that he constantly tried to grab his genitals, and denied doing anything indecent. He added: ""When it comes to arms around his shoulders, teachers did those things in the '80s, I can't remember if I did."" Roger Griffiths, prosecuting, asked whether it was appropriate to be sharing a bedroom during a skiing trip with a schoolboy. Mr Pugh replied: ""At the time, yes - but I probably wouldn't now."" He added that allegations he attempted to perform oral sex on the boy in a parked car were ""outrageous and completely untrue"". He also denied trying to touch the boy's genitals in a lay-by near Dover on return from the trip. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? Two members of the public have died and another three people were injured in a stabbing attack at London Bridge, the Met Police's commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told a press conference the stabbing attack, which has been declared a terrorist incident, began at an event at Fishmonger's Hall. Within five minutes of being called officers confronted the suspect - who was shot dead by police - she said. The suspect was wearing what is thought to have been a hoax explosive device. He was a former prisoner and convicted of a terrorist offence, sources have told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to people who were inside Fishmonger's Hall, where a criminal justice event was taking place. Dozens of people were in attendance, including students from Cambridge University and former prisoners. The university said it was ""gravely concerned"" about reports of its students and staff being caught up in the attack and was urgently seeking further information. Ms Dick said police were working at ""full tilt"" to understand what had happened and whether anyone else was involved. Officers were still working to identify the dead, she said. Of the injured people, one is critical but stable, a second is stable and a third has less serious injuries, the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens said. Details of what happened are still emerging, but videos on social media appear to show passers-by holding down the suspect on London Bridge. Another man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. Footage then shows an officer arriving, seeming to indicate to the group to move, and firing a shot. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". She added: ""Ours is a great city because we embrace each other's differences. ""We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed."" This video can not be played Tour guide Stevie Hurst told 5 Live he kicked the suspect in the head London Bridge: What we know so far Follow the latest updates 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker In pictures: London Bridge attack There was no intelligence of anything about to happen, sources say, and police reacted to events as they unfolded. At the start of this month, the UK threat level was lowered from severe to substantial - reflecting an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack was likely rather than highly likely because of a relative decline in activity. The challenge for police and security services is that low-tech attacks - involving knives or vehicles - and often carried out by lone actors can be hard to spot in advance since they involve relatively little preparation and communication. But in the wake of previous incidents in both the UK and other countries, police have been prepared for this kind of incident and seem to have been fast to intervene, taking few chances, although members of the public were also involved in restraining the individual. The priority for police and MI5 now will be establishing the identity of the individual, whether he had any links or associations and whether there is any ongoing related threat. Earlier, Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the suspect was wearing what is believed to be a hoax explosive device. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said attackers wear fake suicide vests for a couple of reasons: To add to public panic and in some cases to ensure police shoot them dead. To some attackers, martyrdom is preferable to capture, trial and spending many years in prison, our correspondent added. Police have said cordons will remain in place and extra police patrols will be held across the capital. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to Downing Street from his constituency, will convene a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee at 21:30. He said the emergency services and members of the public who intervened ""represent the very best of our country"". ""This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack and our values, our British values, will prevail,"" Mr Johnson added. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our country will never be divided or intimidated...our values will prevail"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan thanked the members of the public who showed ""breathtaking heroism"" in running towards danger - ""not knowing what confronted them"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it has begun a mandatory investigation into the shooting. London Bridge station and Tube has now reopened after it was earlier closed, Network Rail said. But trains may continue to be delayed, cancelled or revised while services are reinstated, it added.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? Two members of the public have died and another three people were injured in a stabbing attack at London Bridge, the Met Police's commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told a press conference the stabbing attack, which has been declared a terrorist incident, began at an event at Fishmonger's Hall. Within five minutes of being called officers confronted the suspect - who was shot dead by police - she said. The suspect was wearing what is thought to have been a hoax explosive device. He was a former prisoner and convicted of a terrorist offence, sources have told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to people who were inside Fishmonger's Hall, where a criminal justice event was taking place. Dozens of people were in attendance, including students from Cambridge University and former prisoners. The university said it was ""gravely concerned"" about reports of its students and staff being caught up in the attack and was urgently seeking further information. Ms Dick said police were working at ""full tilt"" to understand what had happened and whether anyone else was involved. Officers were still working to identify the dead, she said. Of the injured people, one is critical but stable, a second is stable and a third has less serious injuries, the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens said. Details of what happened are still emerging, but videos on social media appear to show passers-by holding down the suspect on London Bridge. Another man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. Footage then shows an officer arriving, seeming to indicate to the group to move, and firing a shot. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". She added: ""Ours is a great city because we embrace each other's differences. ""We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed.""

At the start of this month, the UK threat level was lowered from severe to substantial - reflecting an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack was likely rather than highly likely because of a relative decline in activity. The challenge for police and security services is that low-tech attacks - involving knives or vehicles - and often carried out by lone actors can be hard to spot in advance since they involve relatively little preparation and communication. But in the wake of previous incidents in both the UK and other countries, police have been prepared for this kind of incident and seem to have been fast to intervene, taking few chances, although members of the public were also involved in restraining the individual. The priority for police and MI5 now will be establishing the identity of the individual, whether he had any links or associations and whether there is any ongoing related threat. Earlier, Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the suspect was wearing what is believed to be a hoax explosive device. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said attackers wear fake suicide vests for a couple of reasons: To add to public panic and in some cases to ensure police shoot them dead. To some attackers, martyrdom is preferable to capture, trial and spending many years in prison, our correspondent added.

"Prime Minister Muscat is facing calls to resign over the murder of Daphne Curuana Galizia Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has said a suspect in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia will not be granted immunity to reveal what he knows about the case. Businessman Yorgen Fenech had requested a presidential pardon in exchange for information. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption activist, was killed by a car bomb. Mr Fenech appeared in court on Friday to argue the chief investigator of the case, Keith Arnaud, should be removed. Mr Muscat is under increasing pressure to resign over the case, which started when Ms Galizia was killed in 2017. Mr Fenech's lawyers argue that Mr Arnaud should be removed, due to alleged ties to Mr Muscat and Keith Schembri,  the prime minister's former aide who is allegedly linked to the killing. Mr Schembri resigned last week as chief of staff to the prime minister and was arrested on Tuesday. Mr Fenech has filed a request for President George Vella, and not the cabinet, to consider his request for a pardon, alleging a conflict of interest. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Europe Correspondent It was the most bizarre of sights. The man at the centre of the murder investigation that's rocking Malta strolled out of court, calmly lit a cigarette and walked down the street. Shaven-headed, wearing sunglasses and an expensive suit, Yorgen Fenech was immediately surrounded by journalists. Mr Fenech is one of Malta's richest individuals. I asked him if he was going to name people close to the prime minister who he suggests are implicated in events connected to the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia. He replied in the affirmative, adding he was ""determined that the truth will come out"". When I asked if he himself had ordered the journalist's assassination, he flashed back: ""No I didn't say that. I'm confident the truth will come out."" Mr Fenech's lawyers say the chief police investigator is too close to those around Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, and they claimed in court that there was evidence his chief of staff was leaking secret details about the police investigation. Claims and counter-claims of murky dealings: more reasons why many believe Daphne Caruana Galizia was right about the rotten nature of Malta's state. The prime minister has previously said he will only step down when those who ordered the killing are identified. However,the Times of Malta reported on Friday,externalthat Mr Muscat was preparing to announce his resignation ""immediately"" amid the worsening political crisis. Mr Muscat's Labour Party has cancelled an event on Sunday at which the prime minister was due to speak. The murder that could bring down Malta's government Resignations spark Malta crisis in murder scandal In another development, Council of Europe special rapporteur Pieter Omtzigt, who was appointed in 2018 to monitor the inquiry, called on Mr Muscat to resign.

""Only the three initial suspects have been charged and no-one has been convicted,""he said in a statement,external. ""It is therefore absolutely essential that the next government is free of the suspicions of corruption and misconduct that surrounded the Muscat administration."" Last week Mr Fenech was arrested in a dramatic raid on his yacht. He received hospital treatment after his arrest and has been given police bail. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. Caruana Galizia wrote about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging it had links to senior government figures. Mr Muscat called an emergency cabinet meeting on Thursday night to decide whether to grant Mr Fenech's request. The prime minister said it was the most appropriate course as Mr Fenech had made allegations against the PM's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri - who resigned last week and was arrested on Tuesday. ""I left the final decision with my colleagues, who decided that it's not fitting to grant a pardon,"" Mr Muscat announced at a press conference, flanked by ministers. He stressed that his cabinet had followed the advice of the chief of police and the attorney general. Police confirmed on Thursday that Mr Schembri had been released and was no longer of interest to investigators. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Angry protesters gathered outside the government palace in the early hours of Friday morning. One of Caruana Galizia's sons threw fruit at the car of a government minister and shouted insults, Reuters news agency reports. Under Malta's constitution a pardon can be granted to ""any person concerned in or convicted of any offence"". Investigations into Caruana Galizia's murder intensified when a suspected middleman was pardoned on Monday. The prime minister told parliament the suspect, Melvin Theuma, was being given immunity in return for information about the killing. Maltese reports suggested he had audio recordings linked to the case. On Tuesday, Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi resigned and Economy Minister Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself after being questioned by police on Saturday. They deny involvement. Protests outside government buildings have intensified Mr Muscat's chief aide, Keith Schembri, who had previously been named in the Panama Papers, quit. Caruana Galizia alleged that Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi had benefited from secretive ""shell companies"". Both deny wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio 150,000 euros (Â£132,000),Reuters news agency reports,external. Police have continued to investigate in the hope of finding out who ordered the killing. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children The late journalist's sister, Corinne Vella, told the BBC it was time the truth came out. ""We're finally starting to see some progress in the investigation into Daphne's murder,"" she said. ""It's welcome, it's important, but it's very far long overdue. To us, Daphne's death has always been linked to her work, and we've maintained all along that justice for Daphne means justice for her murder, but also justice for all her stories, because to us they were connected.""

"One of the victims of Friday's attack is named as Jack Merritt, a Cambridge graduate The condition of one of the victims in hospital has improved from critical to stable A woman was also killed. Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

"Aaron Donald will serve a minimum of 18 years in prison A man who murdered a Fife mother by bludgeoning her to death with a claw hammer has been jailed for life. Aaron Donald, 28, struck the back of Claire Turnbull's head eight times with the weapon, shattering her skull. Donald admitted killing the 36-year-old mother in Blairhall near Dunfermline, but claimed it was not murder by reason of diminished responsibility. However, a jury at at the High Court in Livingston rejected this. He will serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. Donald struck Claire Turnbull eight times with a claw hammer Sentencing him, judge Lady Scott told Donald: ""Claire Turnbull was a deeply loving woman known to be friendly and caring. ""You brutally took her life. You have left her young children, her partner and her family without her. ""You had never met her before that day and launched a savage and frenzied attack when she was in the flat and struck her repeatedly with a hammer at least eight times. ""The reason for this attack is not clear. You said she was disrespecting you. ""You present a very real risk of serious harm to the public. However, it is up to the parole board when you are released."" Claire Turnbull was attacked at her flat in Blairhall Donald admitted killing Ms Turnbull at a flat in Blairhall in October 2018 and leaving her lying in a pool of blood. He claimed he had reacted violently after seeing his girlfriend Laura McMurdo fighting off sexual advances from Ms Turnbull. Ms Turnbull's partner Charles Weir said there was no truth to these claims. Ms McMurdo, 30, was also originally charged with Ms Turnbull's murder but was cleared after trial in October.

"This video can not be played E.On's UK head Michael Lewis says the energy retail market is under ""considerable strain"" Energy firm Npower is to cut up to 4,500 UK jobs as part of a plan to make it more profitable. Three call centres are under threat of closure, at Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, an office in Hull and one in Worcester. Unions called the action a ""cruel blow"" for the company's workers in the run-up to Christmas. Under the restructuring, Npower's owner E.On will merge computer systems to save money. ""The UK market is currently particularly challenging,"" said Johannes Teyssen, E.On chief executive. ""We've emphasised repeatedly that we'll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability."" The company said reports from unions of 4,500 job cuts were of the correct ""order of magnitude"", but that the final figure would not be announced while it is still consulting with unions. There are around 2,500 jobs at Houghton-le-Spring, and more than 600 at each of the Hull and Worcester offices. Npower's other sites in the UK are at Leeds, Birmingham, Swindon, Solihull and Oldbury. The restructuring plan - which is set to cost Npower Â£500m - would see small businesses and consumers served by the same computer systems and customer service teams. Large industrial customers would still be served separately. This is a Goldilocks moment in the energy sector. Businesses do not want to be too big or too small to be just right. The biggest suppliers have pointed to the pressures they face on their domestic business from the energy price cap, although this has been to the benefit of millions of consumers. Legacy IT systems also cost a lot. Meanwhile, 16 small energy companies have collapsed since the beginning of last year. Many had grown too quickly, leading to terrible customer service. Their size also meant they struggled to cope with price changes on the wholesale markets. So, that leaves those in the middle, some of which have been successfully picking up domestic customers through switches and serving them through more nimble IT systems. Analysts Cornwall Insight say challenger brands now hold a 30% share of the household energy market, up from 18% two years ago. In four years, it says there could be a 50/50 split between the big six and the challengers. Npower's announcement adds some weight to that prediction. Germany-based E.On said profit for the first nine months of its financial year fell 27% to â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn). The firm said its division serving households would effectively be merged into E.On's. The government-imposed price cap had eroded profits, as it had at competitors, it said. Its division serving other businesses ""is a profitable very good business,"" it said, and would keep the Npower brand name. The GMB union said the announcement would be a ""body blow"" to Npower workers. ""Government has to urgently wake up to the impact that the price cap is having on good and reasonably well-paid jobs in UK energy companies. New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo deal 'Big six' energy firm to cut 900 jobs Do you work for Npower? Get in touch:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""Npower is a poorly managed company with significant losses in the UK but it's always the workers that face the brunt of poor management coupled with regulation that sends work overseas whilst sacking energy workers in the UK."" Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said the news was a ""cruel blow"" for workers. ""They've been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas. ""The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse. If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties,"" he said, urging the government to take ownership of the retail businesses of the six largest providers. Npower, one of the big six energy providers in the UK, announced plans in January to cut 900 jobs in another attempt to save costs. The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap, which began at the start of January.

"Representatives of seven major political parties appeared in a live BBC debate Debate began with tributes to London Bridge victims and emergency services There were clashes over spending plans, the economy, the NHS, Brexit and immigration PM returned to No 10 after terrorist incident to chair an emergency Cobra meeting Parties suspend campaigning in London Vanessa Barford, Joseph Lee and Ella Wills And that's a wrap... We are ending today's live election coverage here. Thanks for joining us. Before we go, a reminder of the main headlines: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Richard Tice and Nicola Sturgeon has some of the most notable clashes All of the politicians of course spent time paying tribute to the bravery of the members of the public who ran towards danger on London Bridge. They all emphasised the need to support the police and security services. But that was more or less where the unity ended. A group of five against two developed quickly. Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens attacked the duet of the Tories and the Brexit Party on the central issues - not just Brexit, but also on the NHS. There is no formal pact, of course, between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives, despite the suggestions of opposition parties in recent weeks. Yet, throughout the 90 minutes, it was Brexiteers versus the rest, whether on our relationship with the EU, or their attitude to the health service. Read the full analysis From sparks flying over NHS claims to learning who would press the nuclear button in a crisis, we've recapped some of the key moments from our seven-way debate. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Caroline Lucas said: âWhen people are shown that freedom of
movement is a reciprocal right, then
actually itâs something that is popular in this country.â Nick Robinson, as host, asked about most opinion polls
showing support for controls on immigration â something Ms Lucas took issue
with. This is a scenario where differently phrased questions on the same topic can produce different answers. Asked how strongly they agree with keeping freedom of
movement â âso that people from any EU country can live and work in the UK, and
people in the UK can live and work in any EU countryâ, more than half the
respondentsto a ComRes survey carried out earlier this month,externalsupported the
idea â 31% strongly, 25% âsomewhatâ. (âNeither agree nor disagreeâ and âdonât knowâ were 11% and
10%). And a 2017 poll by YouGov,externalfor anti-Brexit campaign group
Best for Britain asked
about a plan that is effectively freedom of movement, without calling it that:
âThe right to travel, work, study or retire
in Britain, in exchange for EU countries giving British citizens the same
rights.â The results were 69% in favour and 13% against (and 19%
âdonât knowâ). But when the same survey asked the
same people how important reducing EU immigration was in Brexit negotiations,
70% said it was important in some way (15% said it was the most important
issue, 31% very important, 24% fairly important). So Ms Lucas is correct â but only
if, as she said, the question is asked in a specific way. BBC Radio 5 Live Another caller to BBC Radio 5 Live, Gary from Northern Ireland, says he was concerned that the debate didn't include any of the parties in his part of the country. He says Brexit is a major concern for people there, and so the outcome of this election is likely to be very significant. ""My wife shops in Donegal,"" he says. ""Sheâs concerned, is she going to get border checks on her
shopping?"" Gary says ""English people have a right to decide what their own destiny is"" but he says he doesn't think they understand the border issues. ""English people donât see the raw side of the north of
Ireland, how a wee chip can do so much damage,"" he says. ""And Brexit is a big chip between the communities.""

Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives main campaign messages and escaped relatively unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile in the party and beyond. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the anti and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the partyâs policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit partyâs Richard Tice provided some of the fiery moments which wonât have done either of them any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a âseismicâ event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labourâs record in government in Wales and the Green Partyâs Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an issue in the election campaign. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Well after they came off stage I think none of the seven participants will be hanging their heads in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to they be punching the air in victory. Essentially, everyone taking part got a fair crack of the whip. Reality Check The claim:Rishi Sunak said: ""We've decarbonised our economy faster than any other major economy in the world."" The verdict:A parliamentary report earlier this year noted that ""the UK has achieved greater decarbonisation than any other country in the G20"". So is Mr Sunak correct? Not entirely. The source of that claim in the parliamentary report is theLow Carbon Economy Index,external, published by PwC. It notes that the UK reduced the carbon intensity of its economy - the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted for each unit of economic output - by 3.7% on average between 2000 and 2018. That's the most impressive record in the G20 group of major nations. However, it's not just a Conservative achievement. For much of that time, the UK had a Labour government, and between 2010 and 2015, the UK had a coalition government with the Lib Dems running the Energy and Climate Change department. And in recent years, the UK's performance has not been so outstanding. The decline in carbon intensity in 2017-18 was 3.5%, in ninth place, behind Germany, China, and even Saudi Arabia. PwC says the UK will have to increase its rate of decarbonisation dramatically, to 9.7%, to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050. BBC Radio 5 Live Matt Flinders, politics professor at the University of Sheffield, gives his verdict on the debate:  There's ""no clear winner"" and ""everything is up for grabs"". He says the debate took place in the shadow of the London Bridge attacks, which perhaps made the politicians better behaved and the audience more subdued. But he says the election is ""defined by trust and credibility"" and voters ""don't trust Boris and think Corbyn isn't credible on money"". Prof Flinders says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey struggled to escape from the ""Brexit trap"" of having a less-clear position that other parties. But he says Rishi Sunak could not deal with the problem that people ""would like to have a beer"" with Mr Johnson, but ""they don't trust him to run the country"". Towards the end of the debate, the politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds with him. Here's some of their replies... Nicola Sturgeon: ""Please stand down."" Rishi Sunak: ""Happy Thanksgiving."" Rebecca Long-Bailey: ""I'm a good Catholic so I won't say in public what I probably would say to him, but the most important point I'd make is about the climate emergency and how he needs to change his position."" Richard Tice: ""Let's get a quick trade deal done."" Adam Price: ""Resign and take Boris with you."" Reality Check The Brexit Partyâs Richard Tice said:
âUnlimited immigration in the last 15 years has depressed wagesâ¦We had zero real wage growth.â Last year, thegovernmentâs
independent adviser on migration,externalconcluded that migration âis not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born
workersâ. It âfound some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled
workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however
the magnitude of the impacts are generally small.â The UK has effectively had zero
real wage growth since 2007 - but that is because wages fell after the 2008
crash and are only just now catching up.

the Treasury, said: âWe've outlined a plan for Â£34bn, that will go on putting 50,000
more nurses on our wards, 50m more GP appointments and new and upgraded
hospitalsâ That is the amount of money that
will be added to the annual NHS budget by 2023-24, but the cash sum isnât necessarily
the most helpful figure to use. Because the costs of medicines
and equipment and paying staff are rising, the governmentâs own figures show
this will actually be worth less by 2023-24 â about Â£20.5bn once adjusted for inflation. That's what we
call the ""real-terms"" amount because it's a reflection of how much
you can buy with the money by the time it is used. When it comes to the average
percentage increase in health spending â this investment would mean funding
going up by 3.4% a year through to 2023-4. This would be higher than the
years from 2010 â under the Conservatives in coalition government with the
Liberal Democrats - when it was between 1 and 2%. But it would be significantly
lower than the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when it
averaged 6% a year. Reality Check âI think Trident isâ¦ a financial issue â I donât think we
should be wasting Â£200bn on it.â Nicola Sturgeon says it would cost Â£200bn to replace the
UKâs Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland. But that relies on assumptions about costs stretching ahead
for several decades â it
is not Â£200bn spent (or saved) all at once. The SNPâs number comes from the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, which it based on the best available figures. The largest element
by far is the annual in-service cost, spread over 30 years, estimated at more than
Â£140bn. The Ministry of Defence says the cost of building new submarines would
be Â£31bn alone. But
because those estimates are for decades from now, they make assumptions about
the future economy â so itâs impossible to be precise about the number. BBC political correspondent says... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Olivia says she was undecided but she was leaning towards the Lib Dems after tonight, although ""I never thought I would say it"". She says Jo Swinson seemed the most honest and what she said on climate change was positive.  Reality Check The claim:Jo Swinson said: ""Offshore wind is the cheapest electricity that you can now create, thanks to the Liberal Democrats supporting that technology when we ran the climate change department."" The verdict:Offshore wind is currently more expensive than onshore wind, gas, or solar, but costs have been tumbling rapidly in price. An auction in Septembersaw developers agree to sell power from their projects for less than Â£40 a megawatt hour - a record low price for offshore wind. Analysis by Carbon Brief,externalsuggests that when these new windfarms start running in 2023, they could be slightly cheaper than existing gas-fired power plants. However, the cost of that power in the future will depend on wholesale gas prices, which are impossible to predict. Lib Dems managed the Department for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2015 - so they can claim some credit for supporting the remarkable development of the offshore wind industry during those years. However, the price for offshore wind fell by 30% in the past two years, long after the Lib Dems left government.  Â© 2025 BBC.

He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

"Boris Johnson has pledged to make it easier to help struggling UK companies after Brexit, if the Tories win the general election. The PM said being free of EU rules on state aid would make it quicker to intervene, and bring in ""buy British"" guidelines for public bodies. He added that an Australian-style immigration system would be in place in place by 1 January, 2021. But Labour criticised the Tories' past record of supporting industry. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the prime minister's promise on state aid rules ""sticks in his throat"". He said the Conservatives had ""sat on their hands and used state aid as an excuse"" when refusing to intervene to save a steel works in his Teesside constituency in 2015. Business lobby group the Institute of Directors said the PM's proposals ""suggest a retreat away from free and open markets"" and would have ""clear implications"" for the UK's ability to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs said greater use of state aid to help firms in trouble would ""translate to veiled support for cronyism"". What are the EU rules about state aid? Live: Latest from the campaign trail Parties to be quizzed in seven-way election debate Earlier on Friday, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was hoping for another hung parliament, with her party holding the balance of power. Mr Johnson has guaranteed that if the Conservatives win a working majority, the UK will leave the EU by 31 January at the latest. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, free movement from the EU will continue for 11 months after Brexit during a transition period. Mr Johnson said a new Australian-style immigration system would be in place when the current rules end on 31 December 2020. Under this scheme, those applying to come to the UKwould be awarded pointsbased on professional and personal characteristics, similar to the existing system for non-EU nationals. The PM wanted to set out not just the timescale for leaving the EU but what he saw as the benefits of Brexit for voters While the Conservatives were once the party of free trade, Boris Johnson donned the cloak of protectionism by outlining a new post-brexit state aid regime. And he said public bodies would be encouraged to adopt a ""Buy British"" policy to boost local economies. Critics say these measures would impede attempts to strike a trade deal with the EU. Mr Johnson also declined to say that no-deal preparations would be stood down but expressed confidence a trade agreement would be struck by the end of next year. With Gisela Stuart standing next to him, politically Boris Johnson wants to highlight differences with Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, ""By lowering the number of unskilled immigrants, the system will remove a major force that puts a downward pressure on people's wages and reduce the overall level of immigration,"" Mr Johnson said. As part of what he said was a ""Brexit roadmap"" designed to show voters the benefits of leaving the EU, he said a re-elected Conservative government would take ""immediate steps"" to introduce new rules to take effect after the transition period is due to finish at the end of 2020. Former Labour MP Gisela Stuart said voting Conservative did ""not make me a Tory"" These would include a new state aid regime to help industries in trouble, scrapping VAT on sanitary products and promoting a ""buy British"" rule for public bodies to help farmers. The Conservatives say current EU rules on state aid are bureaucratic and inflexible, citing the difficulties the UK had in getting emergency financial for Tata Steel's UK business in 2012. The party said introducing a new UK state aid regime would allow decisions on whether and how to intervene to be taken within days, allowing a quicker response to economic downturns. The PM said his aim was not to bail out failing business but to ensure a ""level playing field"" for industry. Despite saying he was confident that a free trade agreement would be in place by the end of 2020 when the transition period ends. Mr Johnson added that he saw ""no reason to dismantle"" preparations for leaving the EU without a deal. He said the preparations - which included pledges of Â£2.1bn extra spending under Mr Johnson - were ""thoroughly useful"" in convincing the EU that the UK was ""in earnest"" about leaving. ""Many of those preparations will be extremely valuable as we come out of the EU arrangements anyway, so I think they are the right thing to have done and to keep in a state of readiness,"" he said. Mr Johnson said only a Conservative victory would lift the country out of its ""political morass"" and ""deliver the change that people voted for by getting Brexit done"". He also said: He was not ""running scared"" from an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil, which other party leaders have committed to He wanted to ""take the division out"" of social care funding by finding a cross-party solution which would ensure no one has to sell their home to pay for care His previous remarks that the monarchy was ""beyond reproach"", which followed Prince Andrew's BBC interview, referred to the Queen rather than the Royal Family as a whole He said it was ""inconceivable"" the party would bring back fox hunting and it intended to improve animal welfare after Brexit, including banning ""barbaric"" shark's fin soup Appearing alongside the PM, former Labour minister Gisela Stuart said she would be voting Conservative and urged other traditional Labour voters to do the same if they wanted to see Brexit delivered. Ms Stuart, who stood down at the 2017 election, was the most senior Labour figure in the Vote Leave referendum campaign. ""In this election, I will not vote for Jeremy Corbyn but I can vote for Brexit,"" she said. ""A vote for Boris Johnson this time around is a vote to get Brexit done, But let me be clear, voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future."" The Labour manifesto does not directly mention state aid, but the party has pledged to bring mail, rail, water and energy back into state ownership, and part-nationalise BT. Leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested he thinks EU rules could restrict the government's ability to intervene to support industry. Labour would keep free movement rules if the UK stays in the EU following its planned referendum, or otherwise ""seek to protect"" them if voters opt for its Brexit deal instead. The Brexit Party has vowed to cap permanent immigration into the UK at 50,000 a year. The Liberal Democrats want the UK to stay in the EU, meaning it would continue to follow existing rules on state aid and free movement.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? Two members of the public have died and another three people were injured in a stabbing attack at London Bridge, the Met Police's commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told a press conference the stabbing attack, which has been declared a terrorist incident, began at an event at Fishmonger's Hall. Within five minutes of being called officers confronted the suspect - who was shot dead by police - she said. The suspect was wearing what is thought to have been a hoax explosive device. He was a former prisoner and convicted of a terrorist offence, sources have told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to people who were inside Fishmonger's Hall, where a criminal justice event was taking place. Dozens of people were in attendance, including students from Cambridge University and former prisoners. The university said it was ""gravely concerned"" about reports of its students and staff being caught up in the attack and was urgently seeking further information. Ms Dick said police were working at ""full tilt"" to understand what had happened and whether anyone else was involved. Officers were still working to identify the dead, she said. Of the injured people, one is critical but stable, a second is stable and a third has less serious injuries, the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens said. Details of what happened are still emerging, but videos on social media appear to show passers-by holding down the suspect on London Bridge. Another man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. Footage then shows an officer arriving, seeming to indicate to the group to move, and firing a shot. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". She added: ""Ours is a great city because we embrace each other's differences. ""We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed.""

At the start of this month, the UK threat level was lowered from severe to substantial - reflecting an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack was likely rather than highly likely because of a relative decline in activity. The challenge for police and security services is that low-tech attacks - involving knives or vehicles - and often carried out by lone actors can be hard to spot in advance since they involve relatively little preparation and communication. But in the wake of previous incidents in both the UK and other countries, police have been prepared for this kind of incident and seem to have been fast to intervene, taking few chances, although members of the public were also involved in restraining the individual. The priority for police and MI5 now will be establishing the identity of the individual, whether he had any links or associations and whether there is any ongoing related threat. Earlier, Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the suspect was wearing what is believed to be a hoax explosive device. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said attackers wear fake suicide vests for a couple of reasons: To add to public panic and in some cases to ensure police shoot them dead. To some attackers, martyrdom is preferable to capture, trial and spending many years in prison, our correspondent added. Police have said cordons will remain in place and extra police patrols will be held across the capital. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to Downing Street from his constituency, will convene a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee at 21:30. He said the emergency services and members of the public who intervened ""represent the very best of our country"". ""This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack and our values, our British values, will prevail,"" Mr Johnson added. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our country will never be divided or intimidated...our values will prevail"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan thanked the members of the public who showed ""breathtaking heroism"" in running towards danger - ""not knowing what confronted them"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it has begun a mandatory investigation into the shooting. London Bridge station and Tube has now reopened after it was earlier closed, Network Rail said. But trains may continue to be delayed, cancelled or revised while services are reinstated, it added. Both the Conservatives and Labour say they have suspended election campaigning for the night following the attack. This video can not be played Einar Orn was on his lunch break when suddenly he saw police cars and heard gunshots Witnesses have spoken to the BBC about what they saw. Amanda Hunter, who was on a bus on London Bridge at the time, said: ""All of a sudden [it] stopped and there was some commotion and I looked out the window and I just saw these three police officers going over to a manâ¦ ""It seemed like there was something in his hand, I'm not 100% sure. But then one of the police officers shot him."" Bus driver Mustafa Salih, 62, was travelling from Borough High Street towards London Bridge where he saw emergency vehicles and the police cordon. He told BBC London: ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get off and run'. ""I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. ""One woman was crying. I ran back down to Borough High Street. It was all very scary as we did not know what was happening."" More from witnesses at the scene London Bridge was the scene of another attack, on 3 June 2017, in which eight people were killed and many more injured. This latest attack comes after the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. London Bridge attack: Witness describes scene.

"The watchdog said the banks broke rules by not sending text alerts People who bank with HSBC and Santander are in line for a refund after a watchdog said they had failed to alert customers who went into the red. The Competition and Market Authority said they broke rules by not sending text messages allowing people to avoid unarranged overdraft charges. HSBC said it would refund a total of Â£8m to 115,000 customers. Santander also said it would comply, but has not worked out the cost of the refunds yet. The CMA said the banks first breached the rules in February 2018. It said the refunds would cover all fees incurred by customers who had gone into unarranged overdrafts without being warned in time to take action. The competition watchdog added that it was requiring the two banks to have their compliance with the rules checked independently. HSBC's refund amounts to an average of just over Â£69.50 for each customer affected. However, the actual refund that any customer receives will depend on how much he or she was charged for being overdrawn. HSBC was found to have committed two breaches of the CMA's Retail Banking Market Investigation Order. HSBC broke the rules because it had a policy of not disturbing customers after 22:45, the CMA found. This meant that if customers went overdrawn between that time and 23:45, when balances were calculated, they were not alerted by text. An HSBC spokesperson said: ""Having been the first bank to auto-enrol customers to unarranged overdraft SMS alerts, and seeing that six in 10 of our customers who receive one then pay in money, avoiding additional charges, we appreciate how helpful these text messages can be. ""We apologise to those customers who for different reasons did not receive an alert. We will continue contacting customers who incurred overdraft charges as a result of these issues to apologise and provide a refund."" Santander broke the rules six times. It said: ""We are very sorry that some customers in certain circumstances were not sent the required overdraft alerts. The introduction of these alerts is a move we welcomed and believe is a real support to customers. ""We have carried out a detailed review to understand why the errors happened and have taken steps to fix the issues. We are now working to identify and refund all affected customers as quickly as possible."" This is not the first time that the CMA has taken action against a financial institution over this issue. In August, it ordered Nationwide building society torefund Â£6m in chargesto 320,000 overdrawn customers after failing to send them the correct text warnings. The CMA found that Nationwide had broken rules over text alerts 20 times.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? Two members of the public have died and another three people were injured in a stabbing attack at London Bridge, the Met Police's commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told a press conference the stabbing attack, which has been declared a terrorist incident, began at an event at Fishmonger's Hall. Within five minutes of being called officers confronted the suspect - who was shot dead by police - she said. The suspect was wearing what is thought to have been a hoax explosive device. He was a former prisoner and convicted of a terrorist offence, sources have told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to people who were inside Fishmonger's Hall, where a criminal justice event was taking place. Dozens of people were in attendance, including students from Cambridge University and former prisoners. The university said it was ""gravely concerned"" about reports of its students and staff being caught up in the attack and was urgently seeking further information. Ms Dick said police were working at ""full tilt"" to understand what had happened and whether anyone else was involved. Officers were still working to identify the dead, she said. Of the injured people, one is critical but stable, a second is stable and a third has less serious injuries, the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens said. Details of what happened are still emerging, but videos on social media appear to show passers-by holding down the suspect on London Bridge. Another man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. Footage then shows an officer arriving, seeming to indicate to the group to move, and firing a shot. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". She added: ""Ours is a great city because we embrace each other's differences. ""We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy.

At the start of this month, the UK threat level was lowered from severe to substantial - reflecting an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack was likely rather than highly likely because of a relative decline in activity. The challenge for police and security services is that low-tech attacks - involving knives or vehicles - and often carried out by lone actors can be hard to spot in advance since they involve relatively little preparation and communication. But in the wake of previous incidents in both the UK and other countries, police have been prepared for this kind of incident and seem to have been fast to intervene, taking few chances, although members of the public were also involved in restraining the individual. The priority for police and MI5 now will be establishing the identity of the individual, whether he had any links or associations and whether there is any ongoing related threat. Earlier, Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the suspect was wearing what is believed to be a hoax explosive device. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said attackers wear fake suicide vests for a couple of reasons: To add to public panic and in some cases to ensure police shoot them dead.

"The watchdog said the banks broke rules by not sending text alerts People who bank with HSBC and Santander are in line for a refund after a watchdog said they had failed to alert customers who went into the red. The Competition and Market Authority said they broke rules by not sending text messages allowing people to avoid unarranged overdraft charges. HSBC said it would refund a total of Â£8m to 115,000 customers. Santander also said it would comply, but has not worked out the cost of the refunds yet. The CMA said the banks first breached the rules in February 2018. It said the refunds would cover all fees incurred by customers who had gone into unarranged overdrafts without being warned in time to take action. The competition watchdog added that it was requiring the two banks to have their compliance with the rules checked independently. HSBC's refund amounts to an average of just over Â£69.50 for each customer affected. However, the actual refund that any customer receives will depend on how much he or she was charged for being overdrawn. HSBC was found to have committed two breaches of the CMA's Retail Banking Market Investigation Order. HSBC broke the rules because it had a policy of not disturbing customers after 22:45, the CMA found. This meant that if customers went overdrawn between that time and 23:45, when balances were calculated, they were not alerted by text. An HSBC spokesperson said: ""Having been the first bank to auto-enrol customers to unarranged overdraft SMS alerts, and seeing that six in 10 of our customers who receive one then pay in money, avoiding additional charges, we appreciate how helpful these text messages can be. ""We apologise to those customers who for different reasons did not receive an alert. We will continue contacting customers who incurred overdraft charges as a result of these issues to apologise and provide a refund."" Santander broke the rules six times. It said: ""We are very sorry that some customers in certain circumstances were not sent the required overdraft alerts. The introduction of these alerts is a move we welcomed and believe is a real support to customers. ""We have carried out a detailed review to understand why the errors happened and have taken steps to fix the issues. We are now working to identify and refund all affected customers as quickly as possible."" This is not the first time that the CMA has taken action against a financial institution over this issue. In August, it ordered Nationwide building society torefund Â£6m in chargesto 320,000 overdrawn customers after failing to send them the correct text warnings. The CMA found that Nationwide had broken rules over text alerts 20 times.

"Brad Gobright fell around 300 metres to his death A world-renowned American free solo climber has died attempting to descend the side of a cliff face. Brad Gobright, 31, fell around 300m (1,000ft) to his death in El Potrero Chico in northern Mexico. His companion, fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, fell a shorter distance and survived with injuries. Gobright was best known for free soloing, or climbing without any safety gear, but at the time the two were abseiling, a technique using ropes. Abseiling accidents are believed to be the most common cause of fatalities in the sport. The two men were simul-rappelling - a technique where two climbers descend opposite strands of an anchored rope, with their bodies acting as counterweights to each other - with an 80m rope, the Outside website reports. ""We started rapping,"" Mr Jacobson told the Outside website,,externalusing the North American term for abseiling. ""I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."" This video can not be played Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds speed climbing El Capitan in 2017 While Mr Jacobson crashed through a bush, which cushioned his fall, before striking a ledge, Gobright fell to his death. ""It was basically a blur,"" Mr Jacobson added. ""He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge."" Born in California in 1988, Gobright first started climbing at the age of six. He reportedly dropped out of an Orange County community college in 2009 and worked odd jobs to fund his climbs around North America, before his talent began to attract sponsorship deals. ""I always worked for four months, climbed for eight, and started over,""he told Rock and Ice magazine for a 2017 profile,external. Tributes to Gobright, who once held the coveted speed record on the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, have come in from across the climbing world. Jim Reynolds, who set that speed record with Gobright, wrote on Instagram:""We will carry your spirit, dear friend."",external ""The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,"" said Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. ""You will be dearly missed,""Free Solo director Jimmy Chin wrote on social media,external, calling Gobright ""a true climber's climber"". ""He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I've ever met,"" wrote Alice Hafer, one of Gobright's climbing partners. ""He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me."" It is unclear exactly what happened that caused Gobright to fall. But a Reddit climbing forum discussed the dangers of rappelling in the wake of Gobright's death, posting statistics which suggestmore than a quarter of climbing accidents in North America happen during the descent,external. ""It feels like it's always rappelling... it's not over till you're on the ground folks,"" wrote one commenter. Another said climbers can ""let their guard down"" after a long and tiring day, or become distracted in the rush to get down before the sun sets. ""It takes all of 20 seconds to check yourself, check your partner, and knot your ropes."" El Capitan speed climbing record smashed.

"Activists formed a human chain outside an Amazon depot Activists across France have staged Black Friday protests against Amazon, decrying consumerism and its impact on the environment. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the company's French headquarters in Clichy, north of Paris. Protesters also tried to blockade a shopping centre in Paris and a logistics centre near the eastern city of Lyon. In video from Lyon riot police can be seen dragging activists away. The protests aimed to disrupt Black Friday, a discount shopping day that activists have blamed for environmental damage. In response, Amazon told the BBC it respected the right to protest but disagreed with ""the actions of these individuals"". Amazon hit by Black Friday walkouts and protests 'I feel guilty about how much I return' Amazon boss promises climate-change action Firms make green energy vows as call for action grow Similar protests against Amazon erupted in other European countries, including Germany, where workers from six distribution centres staged a walkout over pay and conditions. The union Verdi, which called the strike, said its members' hard work could not be bought for ""knock-down prices"". Union members at this distribution centre in Werne, Germany went on strike Some French lawmakers want to ban Black Friday because of its environmental impact, and Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne has warned against the ""consumption frenzy"" linked to the event. The shopping day began in the US on the Friday after Thanksgiving but in recent years spread to other countries. Environmentalists have accused Amazon of accelerating climate change through its rapid delivery services, which they say contribute to greenhouse gases emissions. This video can not be played Some of the activists in Clichy scaled a fence overnight Amazon ships around 10 billion packages per year,according to Reuters news agency,external. To mitigate its impact on the climate,the US e-commerce company pledged to go net carbon neutral by 2040by investing in electric delivery vans, among other initiatives. Manon Aubry, a left-wing member of the European parliament, said the protest was intended to ""denounce the social, environmental and fiscal damage from Amazon"". Video from a protest in Lyon showed police in riot helmets dragging away activists Coline Vanhenacker, a spokeswoman for environmental group Friends of the Earth, said Amazon represented ""overproduction, overconsumption and overwaste"". ""Today 25% of French greenhouse gas emissions are linked to textiles and electronics products and Amazon is the leading distributor so we have to put a stop to it,"" she said.

"Conner's mother Nadine says she is concerned how the changes will be implemented The mother of a teenager who was killed by a man on probation has joined calls to reunify Wales' probation service. Nadine Marshall fears that unless the National Probation Service (NPS) has responsibility for programmes and unpaid work, the risk of offenders committing further offences  increases. Her son Conner, 18,was murdered in 2015 by a man in breach of probation. The way offenders are managed in Wales changes next week, with a private firm handing back most work to the NPS. The UK Government said there was ""widespread support"" for the proposals. 'A stranger beat my son to death' But concerns have been raised there are still important areas of offender rehabilitation that will be under the remit of private firms or charities. The probation officers' union Napo pointed out that in so many serious further offence reviews, or homicide reviews, there is a call for the free flow of information so risk assessments are as accurate as possible. It worries that by keeping these two elements of offender management and rehabilitation separate, it reduces that flow, which in turn increases the risk to the public. Conner Marshall was attacked while staying at a caravan site with friends Conner Marshall, 18, died four days after being beaten with a pole by David Braddon at Trecco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, in 2015. Braddon - who had mistaken Conner for someone else - was jailed for life after admitting murder. In the nine months before the killing, Braddon, from Caerphilly, breached his probation by missing eight separate meetings. He was being monitored by a private company - Working Links, Wales' Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) - after he was convicted for drugs offences and assaulting a police officer. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) denied the unprovoked attack could have been predicted or prevented and the company has since gone into administration. Family want answers over son's murder Killer's probation monitoring 'shambolic' Conner Marshall murder 'not predictable' Mrs Marshall, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, backed the concerns of Napo that the changes will leave essential parts of probation being done by non-specialists. She is worried there might be more ""devastating cases like ours"". ""In our case, you don't know when that worm will turn,"" she added. ""It reaches back to the accountability of it - particularly if third sector organisations are expected to pick up the pieces. ""Risk is transient - it's not static, what's a risk today, isn't necessarily one tomorrow. There could be any manner of things that happen."" She said it was a huge expectation to expect non-professionals to notice changes in behaviour or triggers. David Braddon was jailed for life for murdering Conner Marshall in 2015 Napo said two separate organisations dealing with an offender also made it harder for professionals to know if the risks had increased. The changes will bring low and medium-risk offenders back under the NPS, alongside the management of high-risk offenders. But CRCs or third sector organisations will be responsible for unpaid work that offenders must carry out - as well as the courses they have to attend - for example, programmes for addicts, addressing aggressive behaviour or domestic violence. Four years ago the service was split, with private firms created to manage all but high-risk offenders, leading to a number of critical reports and a rise in the number of people on probation going on to commit serious crimes. These changes will happen in Wales first and will roll out to England in 2021. In itsresponse to the consultation earlier this year,external, the UK Government noted there was ""widespread support"" for the proposals in Wales and they were ""broadly considered"" as a positive step. Labour's manifesto said it would ""reunify probation and guarantee a publicly run, locally accountable probation service"". Plaid Cymru said it wanted to see the entire probation service devolved, alongside policing and justice. ""We want to ensure people are properly assessed and supervised so they are not a risk to the public,"" the party added. The Liberal Democrats said: ""The whole probation system needs to be reunified. The planned reforms - including ending the existing CRC contracts early - are clearly necessary but we do not believe these will go nearly far enough to address the major problems in probation"". Other parties have been approached for comment. 'High workloads' affect probation staff Probation services face radical overhaul Family want answers over son's murder 'Shambolic system' led to son's murder Murderer's actions 'not predictable' Mistaken ID murderer jailed for life LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo murdered his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow in a ""brutal and evil attack"" has been jailed. Sana Muhammad, 35, was shot in the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her Ilford home on 12 November, 2018. He hid in the shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard. Unmathallegadoo, 51, was jailed for life with a minimum of 33 years. Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child - survived the attack and was delivered by Caesarean section, the court heard. Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was nine months pregnant when she was killed On the morning of November 12, the defendant, armed with two crossbows, was disturbed by Mrs Muhammad's husband Imtiaz, who had gone to the shed to store a box. Unmathallegadoo ran into the house and shot his ex-wife with an 18-inch arrow as she fled upstairs. Judge Mark Lucraft QC described the killing as ""brutal and evil"", saying if it was not for the presence of her children, Unmathallegadoo would have shot Mr Muhammad too. Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo had been plotting the attack for weeks - buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018. ""You have carefully planned this attack. You had two loaded crossbows and I'm entirely satisfied you intended an attack on Sana and then on Imtiaz,"" the judge said. ""One can only assume that you were jealous of their life together and the fact that they had formed a loving bond between themselves and with your children."" Mrs Muhammad's widower previously paid tribute to his outgoing ""soul mate"". ""She was very friendly, talkative and always made me laugh. She was my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly. ""Ram must have been very jealous of the life Sana and I had and that we were living a happy life."" A jury rejected the defendant's claim he fired the crossbow by accident and found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations The court heard the victim was 16 when she entered into an arranged marriage with the defendant, then aged 30, in Mauritius. Their relationship ended in 2012 after an incident where she jumped from an upstairs window and broke her ankle. Mrs Muhammed filed for an order which banned the defendant from going within 100 metres of her home. It was still in place at the time of the attack.

"Jung Joon-young (left) rose to fame on a TV talent show while Choi Jong-hoon was part of a best-selling band A South Korean court has sentenced K-pop stars Jung Joon-young and Choi Jong-hoon to six and five years in prison for gang raping drunk unconscious women. Jung was also charged with filming the assault and distributing the footage. The men will have to do 80 hours of sexual violence treatment courses and are banned from working with children. The case is one of several sex and abuse scandals that have rocked the K-pop world in recent years. Gangnam: The scandal rocking the playground of K-pop Judge Kang Seong-soo said that Jung, 30, had raped women who were ""drunk and unable to resist, filmed them nude and having sex, then spread it on a group chat"". ""We can't imagine the pain the victims might have felt who found out later."" The K-pop star and the suffering of spy cam victims The woman who defied the world of K-pop South Korea's spy cam porn epidemic He also said it seemed Jung viewed the victims just as a tool for pleasure. In the final testimony, Jung - who rose to fame on a TV talent show - said: ""I deeply regret my foolishness and I feel great remorse."" ""From now on, I shall only... live in remorse,"" he added. In March,he quit the music businessafter admitting that he secretly filmed women and shared the videos. On Choi - a former member of the band F.T. Island, which had number one albums in South Korea - the court said the 30-year-old ""did not feel remorse after mass-raping drunken victims"". The allegations involving some of the the biggest stars of the K-pop world have become a growing scandal. When we investigated the issue earlier this year, lawyer Cha Mee-kyung described these rapes as ""hidden crimes"". I was told women did not want to come forward out of shame, and fear they would be judged - rather than their attackers. Take this chat-room reaction to today's sentence as an example. ""This is rather too much for this type of crime. These women were not kidnapped on the street, but followed the handsome singers."" But young women are realising that together, they do have a voice. In protests and marches they are speaking out. Thanks to them, things are changing. Two K-pop stars who joked about gang-raping women with their friends are now behind bars. At the very least, this horrific crime - which has taken place in the shadows of South Korean society - has been dragged into the light. The case against the two was discovered during a separate police investigation into K-pop superstar Seungri - who was reportedly a member of Jung's group chat. Seungri, whose boyband Big-bang have sold more than 140 million records, has been charged with supplying prostitutes to potential business investors. Police reportedly found Jung's videos while investigating that case.

The PM said being free of EU rules on state aid would make it quicker to intervene, and bring in ""buy British"" guidelines for public bodies. He added that an Australian-style immigration system would be in place in place by 1 January, 2021. But Labour criticised the Tories' past record of supporting industry. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the prime minister's promise on state aid rules ""sticks in his throat"". He said the Conservatives had ""sat on their hands and used state aid as an excuse"" when refusing to intervene to save a steel works in his Teesside constituency in 2015. Business lobby group the Institute of Directors said the PM's proposals ""suggest a retreat away from free and open markets"" and would have ""clear implications"" for the UK's ability to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs said greater use of state aid to help firms in trouble would ""translate to veiled support for cronyism"". What are the EU rules about state aid? Live: Latest from the campaign trail Parties to be quizzed in seven-way election debate Earlier on Friday, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was hoping for another hung parliament, with her party holding the balance of power. Mr Johnson has guaranteed that if the Conservatives win a working majority, the UK will leave the EU by 31 January at the latest. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, free movement from the EU will continue for 11 months after Brexit during a transition period. Mr Johnson said a new Australian-style immigration system would be in place when the current rules end on 31 December 2020. Under this scheme, those applying to come to the UKwould be awarded pointsbased on professional and personal characteristics, similar to the existing system for non-EU nationals. The PM wanted to set out not just the timescale for leaving the EU but what he saw as the benefits of Brexit for voters While the Conservatives were once the party of free trade, Boris Johnson donned the cloak of protectionism by outlining a new post-brexit state aid regime. And he said public bodies would be encouraged to adopt a ""Buy British"" policy to boost local economies. Critics say these measures would impede attempts to strike a trade deal with the EU. Mr Johnson also declined to say that no-deal preparations would be stood down but expressed confidence a trade agreement would be struck by the end of next year. With Gisela Stuart standing next to him, politically Boris Johnson wants to highlight differences with Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, ""By lowering the number of unskilled immigrants, the system will remove a major force that puts a downward pressure on people's wages and reduce the overall level of immigration,"" Mr Johnson said. As part of what he said was a ""Brexit roadmap"" designed to show voters the benefits of leaving the EU, he said a re-elected Conservative government would take ""immediate steps"" to introduce new rules to take effect after the transition period is due to finish at the end of 2020. Former Labour MP Gisela Stuart said voting Conservative did ""not make me a Tory"" These would include a new state aid regime to help industries in trouble, scrapping VAT on sanitary products and promoting a ""buy British"" rule for public bodies to help farmers. The Conservatives say current EU rules on state aid are bureaucratic and inflexible, citing the difficulties the UK had in getting emergency financial for Tata Steel's UK business in 2012. The party said introducing a new UK state aid regime would allow decisions on whether and how to intervene to be taken within days, allowing a quicker response to economic downturns. The PM said his aim was not to bail out failing business but to ensure a ""level playing field"" for industry. Despite saying he was confident that a free trade agreement would be in place by the end of 2020 when the transition period ends. Mr Johnson added that he saw ""no reason to dismantle"" preparations for leaving the EU without a deal. He said the preparations - which included pledges of Â£2.1bn extra spending under Mr Johnson - were ""thoroughly useful"" in convincing the EU that the UK was ""in earnest"" about leaving. ""Many of those preparations will be extremely valuable as we come out of the EU arrangements anyway, so I think they are the right thing to have done and to keep in a state of readiness,"" he said. Mr Johnson said only a Conservative victory would lift the country out of its ""political morass"" and ""deliver the change that people voted for by getting Brexit done"". He also said: He was not ""running scared"" from an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil, which other party leaders have committed to He wanted to ""take the division out"" of social care funding by finding a cross-party solution which would ensure no one has to sell their home to pay for care His previous remarks that the monarchy was ""beyond reproach"", which followed Prince Andrew's BBC interview, referred to the Queen rather than the Royal Family as a whole He said it was ""inconceivable"" the party would bring back fox hunting and it intended to improve animal welfare after Brexit, including banning ""barbaric"" shark's fin soup Appearing alongside the PM, former Labour minister Gisela Stuart said she would be voting Conservative and urged other traditional Labour voters to do the same if they wanted to see Brexit delivered. Ms Stuart, who stood down at the 2017 election, was the most senior Labour figure in the Vote Leave referendum campaign. ""In this election, I will not vote for Jeremy Corbyn but I can vote for Brexit,"" she said. ""A vote for Boris Johnson this time around is a vote to get Brexit done, But let me be clear, voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future."" The Labour manifesto does not directly mention state aid, but the party has pledged to bring mail, rail, water and energy back into state ownership, and part-nationalise BT. Leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested he thinks EU rules could restrict the government's ability to intervene to support industry. Labour would keep free movement rules if the UK stays in the EU following its planned referendum, or otherwise ""seek to protect"" them if voters opt for its Brexit deal instead. The Brexit Party has vowed to cap permanent immigration into the UK at 50,000 a year. The Liberal Democrats want the UK to stay in the EU, meaning it would continue to follow existing rules on state aid and free movement.

"A manuscript written by Queen Elizabeth I has been discovered after lying unnoticed for more than a century. A literary historian from the University of East Anglia made the startling find in Lambeth Palace Library in London. He turned detective to piece together a series of clues to establish that the queen was the author of the writings. The work is a translation of a book in which the Roman historian Tacitus wrote of the benefits of monarchical rule. The manuscript contains clues to the queen's identity as its author It was while searching in the library for translations of Tacitus that Dr John-Mark Philo found the mysterious 42-page manuscript. He established it was written on a very specific kind of paper, which had ""gained special prominence"" in the Tudor Court in the 1590s. ""There was, however, only one translator at the Tudor court to whom a translation of Tacitus was ascribed by a contemporary, and who was using the same paper in her translations and private correspondence - the queen herself,"" added Dr Philo. A further clue was the presence of three watermarks - a rampant lion and the initials G.B with a crossbow countermark - which are also found on the paper Elizabeth I used in her personal correspondence. But the clinching argument was the handwriting. The translation was copied by one of her secretaries but it is covered in corrections and additions which match the queen's highly distinctive, indeed rather messy, hand. Queen Elizabeth I coronation glove to go on show Dress linking Elizabeth I to Welsh confidante displayed Elizabeth I Armada portrait saved with help of 8,000 donors ""The corrections made to the translation are a match for Elizabeth's late hand, which was, to put it mildly, idiosyncratic,"" said Dr Philo. ""The higher you are in the social hierarchy of Tudor England, the messier you can let your handwriting become. For the queen, comprehension is somebody else's problem."" It also shows corrections made by her own hand Dr Philo suggested the monarch might have been studying the text for guidance on how to rule. The translation is from Tacitus's history of the Roman Empire and traces the death of Augustus, the rise of the Emperor Tiberius and the centralisation of power in a single individual. Dr Philo said Tacitus ""has always been considered the subversive historian, and was later reviled under Charles I as anti-monarchical"", which raises questions about why it would be of interest to Elizabeth. Was she drawing upon it for guidance on how to rule or for examples of misrule to be avoided? Alternatively, the translation could just have been a hobby for a queen who is known to have enjoyed classical history. The manuscript has been at Lambeth since the 17th Century but it is the first time the author has been identified. Elizabeth I's Translation of Tacitus is published on 29 November 2019 in the Review of English Studies. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or atbbcnewsents,external.

"Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children A mother whose daughter died at Scotland's largest hospital has said her daughter would be still alive had concerns about water contamination risks been addressed in time. Kimberly Darroch was speaking after a leaked inspection report into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) revealed ""high risks"" in 2015. Milly Main, 10, contracted an infection in 2017 while on the hospital campus. She was recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. The QEUH 2015 inspection report, which ranked infection control measures as ""high risk"" in several areas just two days after the hospital opened, was passed to Labour MSP Anas Sarwar by whistleblowers. The hospital stayed open despite the warnings but has since had to close some wards for a time due to the risks from the water. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) insisted the hospital campus had a ""safe and effective water supply"" and all inspection reports had been acted upon. Warning of 'high risk' to water supply at hospital Hospital infection spiked at time of child's death Ms Darroch told BBC Scotland on Thursday night: ""I'm shocked with the information that came out today. The fact that they've known since since 2015, it's absolutely disgusting that nothing was done about it and no action was taken and the hospital was still opened. ""I believe Milly would still be here if action had been taken. I've no doubt in my mind that Milly would be sitting beside me, right now. ""There is no words to describe that pain of knowing that if things had been different, that if things had been sorted with the water, she would still be here. ""I think the health board needs to be held to account for the mistakes that they made."" She added: ""We wouldn't have been made aware of any of this if it wasn't for the whistleblower coming forward. ""I think there will continue to be shocking revelations for the foreseeable future."" Kimberly Darroch said the leaked report had ""shocked"" her A spokesperson said the Scottish government was ""examining in detail"" the separate material Mr Sarwar had highlighted. They added: ""We want to ensure that all families who have been affected can get the answers that they are clearly entitled to and the health secretary has given her personal assurance that she will ensure this happens. ""We are committed to making sure that these matters are dealt with transparently and with clear accountability, which is one of the reasons the health secretary has instructed a public inquiry in these matters to be chaired by Lord Brodie."" Ms Darroch said she was ""very angry"" and felt the health board had swept the case ""under the carpet"". A hospital complaints manager had contacted her on Thursday but she had not received an apology, she said. Milly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died days later. Her death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death butMs Darroch says the family were kept in the darkabout a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ""We are very sorry for the ongoing distress that has been caused to Ms Darroch and we want to provide parents with as much support as possible. ""We are in contact with Ms Darroch and would like to meet her to answer her questions if she would be happy to do that."" The Legionella assessment was carried out by private contractor DMA Water Treatment two days after the hospital opened In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Sarwar said he had seen figures which suggested there were 50 cases of infections at the Royal Children's Hospital - part of the Â£842m QEUH campus - between 2015 and 2018, and a further 15 unconfirmed cases so far this year. Pressed on the warnings at first minister's questions, Nicola Sturgeon said she was determined to get the ""answers parents deserve"". The documents seen by Mr Sarwar show that NHS Estates commissioned three separate independent reports into the water supply at the QEUH. The first Legionella assessment, carried out by private contractor DMA Water Treatment on 29 April 2015 - two days after the hospital welcomed its first patients - categorised the management of the bacteria as ""high risk"" because there was ""significant communication issues between the parties"" responsible for managing the risk. The problem of contaminated water is one of a number to beset the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. Last year, two cancer wards at the children's hospital were shut because of concerns about infection, and children were moved to the QEUH instead. An inquiry by Health Protection Scotland later identified 23 potential water supply-linked infections during 2018. In January it emerged two patients at the QEUH had died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings.

"A former MP is to receive compensation and costs from the Metropolitan Police of nearly Â£900,000 over the force's disastrous investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring. Harvey Proctor, an ex-Tory politician, had his home raided following claims by fantasist Carl Beech. Mr Proctor, 72, said he would now attempt to repair his ""damaged life in the years that are left to me"". The Met confirmed a settlement was reached late on Thursday evening. Mr Proctor will receive Â£500,000 in compensation and nearly Â£400,000 towards legal fees from Scotland Yard. Operation Midland, which began in 2014, saw dawn raids on the homes of Mr Proctor, D-day veteran Lord Bramall -who died earlier this month, and the late Lord Brittan, following a series of allegations that turned out to be lies. Beech - then known as ""Nick"" - falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 1980s by members of a VIP paedophile ring. Carl Beech: Liar, fraudster and paedophile Judge suggests he was 'misled' over abuse warrants Ex-MP wants action on police who 'misled' judge Home secretary orders VIP abuse inquiry review He is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. During Beech's trial in June, Mr Proctor told of the impactthe allegations had on his life. He said media interest following the police raid led to him losing his job and deciding to leave the UK to live in Spain for his own safety. The payout is believed to be by far the biggest in relation to Operation Midland. In 2017, the forcewas reported to have paidLord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan Â£100,000 each. A statement from Mr Proctor and his lawyers said the settlement was also believed to be the largest ever made by a British police force for negligent behaviour, other than in cases where the victim had been imprisoned. Mr Proctor said he had been advised that he could receive more compensation by going to court. However, he said: ""I am heartily sick of these police and their mealy-mouthed apologies to me and I did not want to take a fortune from public funds. ""Just enough to put my innocence beyond doubt, and to warn police not to make this same mistake with other people."" Mark Stephens, one of Mr Proctor's lawyers, said the case was about a ""vindication of Harvey Proctor"" as well as repairing the ""real losses"" he experienced. As the only surviving figure who was wrongly accused by Beech, Mr Proctor said he also spoke ""for the those whose voices have been stilled"". ""It will take a very long time, if ever, for me to personally have confidence in the Metropolitan Police Service,"" he added. The Met was heavily criticised over Operation Midland in an independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. He reprimanded the force for believing Beech for too long, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald for announcing publicly that Beech's claims were ""credible and true"", and officers for applying for search warrants with flawed information and for failing to close the investigation sooner. Confirmation of the settlement came after Mr Proctor announced he had reported five former Met officers to Northumbria Police in a bid to spark a fresh inquiry into the investigation. Northumbria referred his complaint back to Scotland Yard, which said it was still assessing it. The Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by the officers during Operation Midland. In his statement, Mr Proctor called for a ""full criminal investigation of potential wrong doing"" by officers.

"Victims of historical child abuse are to receive compensation after a long campaign The head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service has contacted six institutions, including some religious orders, about compensation for victims of historical institutional child abuse. In a letter, David Sterling said they all had an obligation to contribute to payments. Mr Sterling said the civil service would ""pursue"" state-led institutions and churches over compensation. Earlier this month, a long-delayed law was passed to allow state compensation. MPs pass long-awaited abuse compensation bill HIA Inquiry finds 'widespread abuse' in children's homes Homes and institutions investigated by HIA The payment of compensation to victims and survivors of child abuse was recommended by the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry nearly three years ago. The inquiry investigated allegations of abuse at children's homes and residential institutions across Northern Ireland over a 73-year period. The HIA compensation is being overseen by a newly-formed redress board. Mr Sterling has made it clear that institutions found guilty of systematic failings by the HIA Inquiry, would be ""reminded of their obligations"". This was to ensure that payments did not fall solely on taxpayers. David Sterling said the civil service would ""pursue"" institutions over compensation The six institutions Mr Sterling has written to are: Barnardos, which ran the Macedon Home in Newtownabbey The Sisters of Nazareth The Good Shepherd Sisters The De La Salle order Irish Church Missions The Sisters of St Louis They have all been asked to identify a point of contact to oversee the redress payments. The Sisters of Nazareth have told BBC News NI they will ""cooperate"" with the redress scheme. The order of nuns ran Nazareth House Children's Home and St Joseph's Home, Termonbacca, both in Londonderry. In a statement on Friday evening, the sisters said: ""It is right and proper that those who have been abused are compensated. ""We are glad that interim arrangements are now in hand and we will cooperate with the [redress] scheme as required. ""We repeat our sincere apology to those who were abused while in our care. Jon McCourt, from campaign group Survivors North West, welcomed the news that the institutions had been asked to contribute. ""It's not right that the taxpayer has to carry the full burden of the redress process,"" he said. Mr McCourt said that the compensation was due to be funded from Northern Ireland's block grant from Westminster, which funds public services such as health and education, and that would be ""grossly unfair"". ""We have had amazing support from the general public here in the north,"" he said. ""I would hate to think that, as a result of the financial contribution that makes up the redress fund coming off the top of the block grant, we would lose the goodwill of the people who have supported us."" Jon McCourt said it was not right that the taxpayer should fund the full compensation bill He argued that money from the Treasury or Westminster should be made available to pay for the compensation because direct rule was in place during the period investigated by the HIA inquiry. It is thought that 5,000 victims could be eligible for a payment, with the final figure running into tens of millions of pounds. The compensation scheme was among the recommendations in the final report of the HIA Inquiry. The public inquiry examined allegations of physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children in residential institutions in Northern Ireland between 1922 and 1995. Chaired by the late Sir Anthony Hart, it investigated institutions run by religious, charitable and state organisations. The HIA Inquiry was chaired by the late Sir Anthony Hart (centre), a retired judge Sir Anthony recommended in his final report that all victims should receive tax free, lump sum payments ranging from Â£7,500 to Â£100,000 from a government-funded redress scheme. However, the legislation stalled after the collapse of Stormont in January 2017. Earlier this month,Appeal Court judges ruled that Stormont's Executive Office had the power to compensate survivors in Northern Ireland. The following day,long-awaited legislation that will provide compensationfor survivors was fast-tracked through Westminster, before Parliament was dissolved for the general election. Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith described the bill as the first of its kind in the UK, in terms of how abuse survivors should receive recompense.

"A former MP is to receive compensation and costs from the Metropolitan Police of nearly Â£900,000 over the force's disastrous investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring. Harvey Proctor, an ex-Tory politician, had his home raided following claims by fantasist Carl Beech. Mr Proctor, 72, said he would now attempt to repair his ""damaged life in the years that are left to me"". The Met confirmed a settlement was reached late on Thursday evening. Mr Proctor will receive Â£500,000 in compensation and nearly Â£400,000 towards legal fees from Scotland Yard. Operation Midland, which began in 2014, saw dawn raids on the homes of Mr Proctor, D-day veteran Lord Bramall -who died earlier this month, and the late Lord Brittan, following a series of allegations that turned out to be lies. Beech - then known as ""Nick"" - falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 1980s by members of a VIP paedophile ring. Carl Beech: Liar, fraudster and paedophile Judge suggests he was 'misled' over abuse warrants Ex-MP wants action on police who 'misled' judge Home secretary orders VIP abuse inquiry review He is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. During Beech's trial in June, Mr Proctor told of the impactthe allegations had on his life. He said media interest following the police raid led to him losing his job and deciding to leave the UK to live in Spain for his own safety. The payout is believed to be by far the biggest in relation to Operation Midland. In 2017, the forcewas reported to have paidLord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan Â£100,000 each. A statement from Mr Proctor and his lawyers said the settlement was also believed to be the largest ever made by a British police force for negligent behaviour, other than in cases where the victim had been imprisoned. Mr Proctor said he had been advised that he could receive more compensation by going to court. However, he said: ""I am heartily sick of these police and their mealy-mouthed apologies to me and I did not want to take a fortune from public funds. ""Just enough to put my innocence beyond doubt, and to warn police not to make this same mistake with other people."" Mark Stephens, one of Mr Proctor's lawyers, said the case was about a ""vindication of Harvey Proctor"" as well as repairing the ""real losses"" he experienced. As the only surviving figure who was wrongly accused by Beech, Mr Proctor said he also spoke ""for the those whose voices have been stilled"". ""It will take a very long time, if ever, for me to personally have confidence in the Metropolitan Police Service,"" he added. The Met was heavily criticised over Operation Midland in an independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. He reprimanded the force for believing Beech for too long, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald for announcing publicly that Beech's claims were ""credible and true"", and officers for applying for search warrants with flawed information and for failing to close the investigation sooner. Confirmation of the settlement came after Mr Proctor announced he had reported five former Met officers to Northumbria Police in a bid to spark a fresh inquiry into the investigation. Northumbria referred his complaint back to Scotland Yard, which said it was still assessing it. The Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by the officers during Operation Midland. In his statement, Mr Proctor called for a ""full criminal investigation of potential wrong doing"" by officers.

"The Conservative Party is embroiled in a row with Channel 4 over the broadcaster's decision to ""empty chair"" Boris Johnson during its election debate on climate change last night. Minister Michael Gove offered to take his place, but the broadcaster said the invitation was for leaders only. The party wrote to Ofcom saying placing an ice sculpture on the PM's podium was a ""provocative partisan stunt"". Mr Johnson has defended his absence, saying he can't appear on ""everything"". Labour has accused the PM of avoiding media scrutiny, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying Mr Johnson was also ""running scared"" of a one-on-one interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil that all the other party leaders have agreed to. But Mr Johnson told LBC Radio he had done ""plenty of debates"" and had told Channel 4 ""ages ago"" that he would not be attending its event.

Earlier, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said there ""no suggestion at all"" that Channel 4 was now under threat. ""The government has no plans in terms of changing what Channel 4 does,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. Former Conservative culture minister Ed Vaizey - who isnot standing for re-election as an MP- said it was not ""sensible"" for political parties to ""threaten"" broadcasters and he would be ""disappointed"" if the Conservatives took the matter any further after the election. With the Conservatives having the slowest timetable of the main parties currently in Parliament for virtually eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, environmentalists say Mr Gove's arrival at the Channel 4 debate as Boris Johnson's substitute was a diversion. The five party leaders who were present diverged on how quickly the UK could meet its aim of hitting the net zero carbon target. The Conservatives say they will do it by 2050 - but also plan to spend Â£28bn on road-building, which experts say will increase emissions. The Lib Dems and SNP want a 2045 deadline. The Greens and Plaid Cymru argue it must happen by 2030. Jeremy Corbyn said the majority of emissions must be gone by 2030 - but Labour haven't set a firm end date on reaching the zero target. All the leaders in the debate promised a green industrial revolution and joined in a bidding war over who would plant most trees. Mr Corbyn came under fire for dodging a question on whether he would support new nuclear power stations. The Greens and Lib Dems said they would tax frequent fliers, but other speakers slid away from answering that thorny question. Former Channel 4 chief executive Lord Grade told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire Programme that the ""alleged threat"" was ""pretty empty"" and from ""some lowly unnamed source"". But he said he never would have sanctioned the empty-chair decision, calling it ""a political statement"" and ""very, very dangerous"". Channel 4 also replaced Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage with ice in the hour-long programme. Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear said: ""These two ice sculptures represent the emergency on planet earth, not in any human form but are a visual metaphor for the Conservative and Brexit parties after their leaders declined our repeated invitations to attend tonight's vital climate debate.""

"Brad Gobright fell around 300 metres to his death A world-renowned American free solo climber has died attempting to descend the side of a cliff face. Brad Gobright, 31, fell around 300m (1,000ft) to his death in El Potrero Chico in northern Mexico. His companion, fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, fell a shorter distance and survived with injuries. Gobright was best known for free soloing, or climbing without any safety gear, but at the time the two were abseiling, a technique using ropes. Abseiling accidents are believed to be the most common cause of fatalities in the sport. The two men were simul-rappelling - a technique where two climbers descend opposite strands of an anchored rope, with their bodies acting as counterweights to each other - with an 80m rope, the Outside website reports. ""We started rapping,"" Mr Jacobson told the Outside website,,externalusing the North American term for abseiling. ""I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."" This video can not be played Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds speed climbing El Capitan in 2017 While Mr Jacobson crashed through a bush, which cushioned his fall, before striking a ledge, Gobright fell to his death. ""It was basically a blur,"" Mr Jacobson added. ""He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge."" Born in California in 1988, Gobright first started climbing at the age of six. He reportedly dropped out of an Orange County community college in 2009 and worked odd jobs to fund his climbs around North America, before his talent began to attract sponsorship deals. ""I always worked for four months, climbed for eight, and started over,""he told Rock and Ice magazine for a 2017 profile,external. Tributes to Gobright, who once held the coveted speed record on the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, have come in from across the climbing world. Jim Reynolds, who set that speed record with Gobright, wrote on Instagram:""We will carry your spirit, dear friend."",external ""The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,"" said Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. ""You will be dearly missed,""Free Solo director Jimmy Chin wrote on social media,external, calling Gobright ""a true climber's climber"". ""He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I've ever met,"" wrote Alice Hafer, one of Gobright's climbing partners. ""He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me."" It is unclear exactly what happened that caused Gobright to fall. But a Reddit climbing forum discussed the dangers of rappelling in the wake of Gobright's death, posting statistics which suggestmore than a quarter of climbing accidents in North America happen during the descent,external. ""It feels like it's always rappelling... it's not over till you're on the ground folks,"" wrote one commenter. Another said climbers can ""let their guard down"" after a long and tiring day, or become distracted in the rush to get down before the sun sets.

"A Japanese department store where staff could wear badges if they were on their period has said it will ""rethink"" that policy. The badges - which featured a cartoon character known as Miss Period - were introduced in October. The intention was that staff could get extra help, or longer breaks, if they were wearing one. ""It was never the intention to share the menstrual information with their customers,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. The Daimaru branch at Osaka Umeda introduced the badges in October for the 500 or so staff in the women's wardrobe section. The badges, which were voluntary, were introduced after a suggestion from employees themselves, and were linked to the opening of a new section of the store. Allow Twitter content?

On one side, the badge said the new section devoted to ""women's wellbeing"", was opening on 22 November. On the other side was the ""Seiri-chan"" mascot (seiri meaning period or menstruation). The idea, Daimaru spokeswoman Yoko Higuchi told the BBC, was to ""improve the working environment"" for staff by sharing the information. When the store told the media about the badges on 21 November, some outlets incorrectly reported that the purpose was to let customers - as well as colleagues - know if a woman was on her period. One unnamed Daimaru executivetold local media,externalthere were then ""many complaints"" from the public, with ""some of them concerning harassment"". How to create a period-friendly workplace Why are women sharing their period stories? Ms Higuchi said some staff ""didn't see the point"" in the badges or were ""reluctant"" to wear them. ""But others were positive,"" she added. ""If you saw a colleague was having her period, you could offer to carry heavy things for her, or suggest she takes longer breaks, and this support would be mutual."" She also said customers had phoned in with their support. Daimaru are not cancelling the policy, but they are rethinking it. Ms Higuchi said they would come up with a different way of sharing the information - without alerting the public. Analysis by Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo As in many countries, menstruation in Japan was something women rarely talked about in public, let alone with men. And the subject was always tinged with shame. But that is changing in a big way. A few days ago, a widely-watched morning programme ""Asaichi"", on the public broadcaster NHK, spent over an hour - with both female and male commentators - discussing how to talk frankly about menstruation with your family and friends. When the consumption tax rate was raised from 8% to 10% in October, menstrual products were subjected to the hike. This caused indignation among many women - and has added to the social dialogue about women's periods. While social media has contributed to this openness, another impetus has been the experience of many women in shelters during natural disasters. We've seen many (uncorroborated) stories on social media about women in those shelters being told to control their bleeding, or told that asking for tampons was contemptible. One reported response in the shelters, for example, was: ""How can you be thinking about sex at a time like this?""

"A former MP is to receive compensation and costs from the Metropolitan Police of nearly Â£900,000 over the force's disastrous investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring. Harvey Proctor, an ex-Tory politician, had his home raided following claims by fantasist Carl Beech. Mr Proctor, 72, said he would now attempt to repair his ""damaged life in the years that are left to me"". The Met confirmed a settlement was reached late on Thursday evening. Mr Proctor will receive Â£500,000 in compensation and nearly Â£400,000 towards legal fees from Scotland Yard. Operation Midland, which began in 2014, saw dawn raids on the homes of Mr Proctor, D-day veteran Lord Bramall -who died earlier this month, and the late Lord Brittan, following a series of allegations that turned out to be lies. Beech - then known as ""Nick"" - falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 1980s by members of a VIP paedophile ring. Carl Beech: Liar, fraudster and paedophile Judge suggests he was 'misled' over abuse warrants Ex-MP wants action on police who 'misled' judge Home secretary orders VIP abuse inquiry review He is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. During Beech's trial in June, Mr Proctor told of the impactthe allegations had on his life. He said media interest following the police raid led to him losing his job and deciding to leave the UK to live in Spain for his own safety. The payout is believed to be by far the biggest in relation to Operation Midland. In 2017, the forcewas reported to have paidLord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan Â£100,000 each. A statement from Mr Proctor and his lawyers said the settlement was also believed to be the largest ever made by a British police force for negligent behaviour, other than in cases where the victim had been imprisoned. Mr Proctor said he had been advised that he could receive more compensation by going to court. However, he said: ""I am heartily sick of these police and their mealy-mouthed apologies to me and I did not want to take a fortune from public funds. ""Just enough to put my innocence beyond doubt, and to warn police not to make this same mistake with other people."" Mark Stephens, one of Mr Proctor's lawyers, said the case was about a ""vindication of Harvey Proctor"" as well as repairing the ""real losses"" he experienced. As the only surviving figure who was wrongly accused by Beech, Mr Proctor said he also spoke ""for the those whose voices have been stilled"". ""It will take a very long time, if ever, for me to personally have confidence in the Metropolitan Police Service,"" he added. The Met was heavily criticised over Operation Midland in an independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. He reprimanded the force for believing Beech for too long, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald for announcing publicly that Beech's claims were ""credible and true"", and officers for applying for search warrants with flawed information and for failing to close the investigation sooner. Confirmation of the settlement came after Mr Proctor announced he had reported five former Met officers to Northumbria Police in a bid to spark a fresh inquiry into the investigation. Northumbria referred his complaint back to Scotland Yard, which said it was still assessing it. The Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by the officers during Operation Midland. In his statement, Mr Proctor called for a ""full criminal investigation of potential wrong doing"" by officers.

"The AQE has a three test procedure for transfer tests. The joint head of the AQE exam body has said that sick children who miss Saturday's third and final transfer test will not get to sit it again. Dr Darrin Barr spoke out after nine schools across NI were this week closed due to the winter vomiting bug. He said that while he felt sorry for those affected, ""there is no provision"" for an extra test. ""The system that we have allows for this eventuality, two tests can count towards the final result,"" he added. Hundreds of children across Northern Ireland have been sick this week,causing schools to close for deep cleansin a bid to stem the spread of the infection. Norovirus, also called the ""winter vomiting bug"", is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea. It can be very unpleasant but usually goes away in about two days. Advice for treatment is: Stay off school or work until the symptoms have stopped for two days Avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time Get plenty of rest Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash - take small sips if you feel sick. Source: NHS,external Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, the AQE (Association for Quality Education) head said that despite this, there will be no extra test for pupils to sit. ""The model of AQE is the two best results are taken from the three tests and that will produce a standardised score which can be used for application for entry into grammar school,"" he said. ""If the children only manage to do one test then they will be issued with a raw score by AQE at the same time as the children who are issued with the AQE result."" Dr Barr said that a raw result can be used to apply to grammar schools. ""That raw score can be used by the parents if they want to apply for special circumstances through the transfer procedure,"" he said. Dr Barr said it was not possible to arrange schools or overflow centres to facilitate an extra test ""A raw result does not give a final standardised score that grammar schools use for their entrance criteria. ""However, a raw score will be issued to the parent and they can then use that with any other primary school data to apply for special circumstances to the grammar schools."" The AQE chief added that it was a practical impossibility to hold an extra test: ""Even if we had a fourth test and had it printed and available, to ask the 34 schools and four overflow centres to put on a further test, it can't happen because of the way schools work.""

"The Conservatives are promising to strengthen England's education watchdog Ofsted, as they attack Labour and Liberal Democrat plans to replace the current inspection system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is announcing plans for longer inspections and an extra Â£10m funding for Ofsted. There will also be trials of ""no-notice inspections"", where schools could be visited without any prior warning. But Labour and the Lib Dems want to replace Ofsted with different bodies. Head teachers say the idea of no-notice inspections has been proposed and rejected as impractical so many times before that it is ""flogging a dead horse"". The Conservatives are setting out a clear dividing line in their policy on schools - calling for a bigger role for Ofsted while opposition parties are moving in the opposite direction and wanting to close it down. Mr Johnson says there will be an extra day added to inspections of secondary and large primary schools to focus on behaviour, bullying and extra-curricular activities, such as sport. He will also announce a pilot of inspections without any notice - an idea previously floated and then rejected because of concerns that inspectors could arrive on days when none of the relevant senior staff was present. Outstanding schools might not be that good Ofsted cuts leave parents guessing, say MPs Labour would replace 'unfit for purpose' Ofsted The idea behind ""no-notice"" inspections had been to reveal the unvarnished reality of schools, rather than giving staff a few hours to prepare. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, rejected the idea of no-notice inspections as making ""absolutely no sense"". ""No-notice inspections will do more harm than good - they will result in more wasted time for inspectors, whilst arrangements are frantically put in place to meet their needs,"" said Mr Whiteman. ""They will be more disruptive and stressful to teachers and pupils; and will give zero additional insight in return,"" he said. Mr Johnson will also confirm plans to end the exemption, introduced by Conservative education ministers, that saw ""outstanding"" schools not having to face regular inspections. ""Ofsted is an independent and trusted source of information for parents and teachers and their inspections help to raise standards in our schools,"" said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He said that Labour's plan to scrap Ofsted would leave parents without ""reliable information about the performance of their child's school"". Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, welcomed what he called a U-turn on removing the exemption on inspecting outstanding schools. But he said the idea of no-notice inspections had been ""raised and rejected"" so many times before that there was no ""purpose in flogging this dead horse yet again"". Labour has argued that Ofsted is ""unfit for purpose"" and needs to be replaced by a more effective body for checking standards. It would remove grades for schools - such as outstanding, good or inadequate - and would set up a new organisation to inspect them. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has warned that too often, Ofsted judgments were a reflection of ""the affluence of a school's intake and the social class of its pupils - not the performance of the school"". She said the education watchdog had ""created a culture of fear among teachers, driven thousands from the profession, and fails to give parents meaningful information about their children's school"". The Liberal Democrats say they would replace Ofsted with a new ""HM Inspector of Schools"", with inspections every three years. Under the current arrangements, the Lib Dems say that more than a thousand schools have not been inspected for over a decade. ""Hundreds of thousands of pupils could be in declining schools, but we simply don't know,"" said the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran. ""The Ofsted brand is fundamentally broken. It creates a huge unnecessary workload and stress for both pupils and teachers. It needs to be replaced with a schools watchdog that parents and teachers can trust,"" she said. The Public Accounts Committee warned last year that Ofsted had faced a significant cut in the value of its budget - which was Â£132m in 2018-19. The MPs warned that the amount spent on inspecting schools had fallen by 52% in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2017-18.

"This video can not be played E.On's UK head Michael Lewis says the energy retail market is under ""considerable strain"" Energy firm Npower is to cut up to 4,500 UK jobs as part of a plan to make it more profitable. Three call centres are under threat of closure, at Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, an office in Hull and one in Worcester. Unions called the action a ""cruel blow"" for the company's workers in the run-up to Christmas. Under the restructuring, Npower's owner E.On will merge computer systems to save money. ""The UK market is currently particularly challenging,"" said Johannes Teyssen, E.On chief executive. ""We've emphasised repeatedly that we'll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability."" The company said reports from unions of 4,500 job cuts were of the correct ""order of magnitude"", but that the final figure would not be announced while it is still consulting with unions. There are around 2,500 jobs at Houghton-le-Spring, and more than 600 at each of the Hull and Worcester offices. Npower's other sites in the UK are at Leeds, Birmingham, Swindon, Solihull and Oldbury. The restructuring plan - which is set to cost Npower Â£500m - would see small businesses and consumers served by the same computer systems and customer service teams. Large industrial customers would still be served separately. This is a Goldilocks moment in the energy sector. Businesses do not want to be too big or too small to be just right. The biggest suppliers have pointed to the pressures they face on their domestic business from the energy price cap, although this has been to the benefit of millions of consumers. Legacy IT systems also cost a lot. Meanwhile, 16 small energy companies have collapsed since the beginning of last year. Many had grown too quickly, leading to terrible customer service. Their size also meant they struggled to cope with price changes on the wholesale markets. So, that leaves those in the middle, some of which have been successfully picking up domestic customers through switches and serving them through more nimble IT systems. Analysts Cornwall Insight say challenger brands now hold a 30% share of the household energy market, up from 18% two years ago. In four years, it says there could be a 50/50 split between the big six and the challengers. Npower's announcement adds some weight to that prediction. Germany-based E.On said profit for the first nine months of its financial year fell 27% to â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn). The firm said its division serving households would effectively be merged into E.On's. The government-imposed price cap had eroded profits, as it had at competitors, it said. Its division serving other businesses ""is a profitable very good business,"" it said, and would keep the Npower brand name. The GMB union said the announcement would be a ""body blow"" to Npower workers. ""Government has to urgently wake up to the impact that the price cap is having on good and reasonably well-paid jobs in UK energy companies. New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo deal 'Big six' energy firm to cut 900 jobs Do you work for Npower? Get in touch:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""Npower is a poorly managed company with significant losses in the UK but it's always the workers that face the brunt of poor management coupled with regulation that sends work overseas whilst sacking energy workers in the UK."" Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said the news was a ""cruel blow"" for workers. ""They've been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas. ""The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse. If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties,"" he said, urging the government to take ownership of the retail businesses of the six largest providers. Npower, one of the big six energy providers in the UK, announced plans in January to cut 900 jobs in another attempt to save costs. The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap, which began at the start of January.

You can read more about the BBC's election debateshere, and the BBC's election guidelineshere. The production team will ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it. Throughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to ask further spontaneous questions to the panel, or, of course, to make their own comments.

"Five party leaders took part in Channel 4's climate debate. Two other leaders, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage were invited but chose not to take part. They were replaced by melting ice sculptures. Reality Check has been looking at some of the claims made in the debate. Reality Check:The Labour leader made this claim while talking about his party's plans to plant 2 billion trees by 2040 -something we've looked at in a separate piece. 13% of the UK is covered by trees which is well below the European Union (EU) average of more than 30%. A few European countries have even lower levels of tree coverage: Ireland has 11% and Malta has almost none. You can read more about the parties' tree-planting proposals here. Reality Check:That claim was supported byScottish government statistics in 2018,externalthat showed levels in 2016 were 49% below the 1990 baseline, following a 10.3% drop on the previous year. Much of that year's drop was attributed to the 2016closure of the Longannet power station. Butmore recent figures,externalshowed that by 2017 emissions were 47% down from 1990. Roger Harrabin: How far do the parties' climate promises go? How many trees can you plant? Should you fly, drive or take the train? Reality Check:Plans to make all UK homes zero-carbon were first proposed by Gordon Brown in 2006, andcancelled by the Conservative government in 2015,external. Zero-carbon homes have better energy efficiency standards and generate all the energy they need onsite through things like solar panels. The justification for the move was to reduce regulations on housebuilders, which would have made it harder for the government to meet its targets for home construction. Conservative Viscount Younger of Leckie said in 2015: ""research has shown that the zero-carbon standard would have placed a significant regulatory burden on housebuilders and developers."" The following year, the Mayor of London put in place a zero carbon standard for homes in the city. The Conservative Party has included a pledge to build ""environmentally-friendly homes"" in its 2019 manifesto. Reality Check:The Plaid Cymru leader made this claim when asked by the Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy whether he was prepared to tell sheep and cattle farmers in Wales that people would have to eat less meat to help the environment. He said no. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC) in August 2019 does not explicitly advise people to stop eating meat and drinking milk. But it does say: ""Consumption of healthy and sustainable diets presents major opportunities for reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. Examples of healthy and sustainable diets are high in coarse grains, pulses, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and low in energy-intensive animal-sourced and discretionary foods (such as sugary beverages)."" Reality Check:That figure is based on analysis of agovernment survey,external(carried out in 2014) by a group calling for a frequent flyer levy. It found that 52% of people surveyed had taken no flights in the previous year, 22% had taken one, 11% had taken two and 15% had taken three or more. The Department for Transport's published figures do not break down far enough to confirm the claim, butresearchers from Full Fact,externalspoke to the department, which confirmed that a more detailed breakdown of responses suggested those 15% of flyers made 70% of the total flights.

"UK drone pilots must register their details with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the end of 29 November or face a fine of Â£1,000. Anyone responsible for a drone which weighs more than 250g (8.8oz) must register it with the regulator online. The drone operator must be over 18 and pay a Â£9 annual fee. The CAA estimates that there are 130,000 drone users in Britain, but so far only around 50,000 people have registered. Anyone of any age can still fly a drone, if they complete a free 20 question multiple choice quiz online and the drone is registered with an adult. In December 2018, drone sightings on the runways at Gatwick Airportcaused havoc for thousands of Christmas travellers. The disruption caused about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or diverted over a 36-hour-period. Simon Smith, a pilot instructor at the Phantom Flight School in Maidstone, Kent, told the BBC that the new regulations could help keep the skies safe, but only in conjunction with better technologies. DJI's new Wi-Fi Aware protocol in action DJI, the largest consumer drone maker in the world, recently demonstrated a new protocol thatenables people to use smartphones to identify nearby dronesand pinpoint where their pilots are located. ""Hand-in-hand with regulations will come technology, as drones are automatically broadcasting details of where they are, who's flying them, where the pilot is located,"" said Mr Smith. ""Stuff like that will inevitably improve the situation. We've got to share the air safely and in order to do that, everybody has to got to know where everybody else is."" Apart from facing a hefty fine, people with unregistered drones also potentially face criminal charges if they fly them illegally or negligently, according to the police. The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for the criminal use of drones, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, said: ""We have plans in place to protect the public and we will pursue, investigate and prosecute anyone who uses a drone illegally or in a dangerous way that puts people at risk.""

Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, welcomed what he called a U-turn on removing the exemption on inspecting outstanding schools. But he said the idea of no-notice inspections had been ""raised and rejected"" so many times before that there was no ""purpose in flogging this dead horse yet again"". Labour has argued that Ofsted is ""unfit for purpose"" and needs to be replaced by a more effective body for checking standards. It would remove grades for schools - such as outstanding, good or inadequate - and would set up a new organisation to inspect them. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has warned that too often, Ofsted judgments were a reflection of ""the affluence of a school's intake and the social class of its pupils - not the performance of the school"". She said the education watchdog had ""created a culture of fear among teachers, driven thousands from the profession, and fails to give parents meaningful information about their children's school"". The Liberal Democrats say they would replace Ofsted with a new ""HM Inspector of Schools"", with inspections every three years. Under the current arrangements, the Lib Dems say that more than a thousand schools have not been inspected for over a decade. ""Hundreds of thousands of pupils could be in declining schools, but we simply don't know,"" said the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran. ""The Ofsted brand is fundamentally broken. It creates a huge unnecessary workload and stress for both pupils and teachers. It needs to be replaced with a schools watchdog that parents and teachers can trust,"" she said. The Public Accounts Committee warned last year that Ofsted had faced a significant cut in the value of its budget - which was Â£132m in 2018-19. The MPs warned that the amount spent on inspecting schools had fallen by 52% in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2017-18.

"Almost a quarter of young people are so dependent on their smartphones that it becomes like an addiction, suggests research by psychiatrists. The study, from King's College London, says such addictive behaviour means that people become ""panicky"" or ""upset"" if they are denied constant access. The youngsters also cannot control the amount of time they spend on the phone. The study warns that such addictions have ""serious consequences"" for mental health. The research, published in BMC Psychiatry, analysed 41 studies involving 42,000 young people in an investigation into ""problematic smartphone usage"". The study found 23% had behaviour that was consistent with an addiction - such as anxiety over not being able to use their phone, not being able to moderate the time spent and using mobiles so much that it was detrimental to other activities. Confessions of a smartphone addict 'Phone-free Fridays' to keep young off mobiles Half of parents want mobile phones banned in school Such addictive behaviour could be linked to other problems, says the study, such as stress, a depressed mood, lack of sleep and reduced achievement in school. ""Smartphones are here to stay and there is a need to understand the prevalence of problematic smartphone usage,"" says one of the report's authors, Nicola Kalk, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London. ""We don't know whether it is the smartphone itself that can be addictive or the apps that people use,"" said Dr Kalk. ""Nevertheless, there is a need for public awareness around smartphone use in children and young people, and parents should be aware of how much time their children spend on their phones."" Co-author Samantha Sohn warned that addictions ""can have serious consequences on mental health and day-to-day functioning, so there is a need for further investigation into problematic smartphone usage"". But Amy Orben, research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge, warned against assuming there were causal connections between problematic smartphone use and outcomes such as depression. ""It has been shown previously that smartphone effects are not a one-way street, but that mood can impact the amount of smartphone use, as well,"" said Dr Orben.

"This video can not be played E.On's UK head Michael Lewis says the energy retail market is under ""considerable strain"" Energy firm Npower is to cut up to 4,500 UK jobs as part of a plan to make it more profitable. Three call centres are under threat of closure, at Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, an office in Hull and one in Worcester. Unions called the action a ""cruel blow"" for the company's workers in the run-up to Christmas. Under the restructuring, Npower's owner E.On will merge computer systems to save money. ""The UK market is currently particularly challenging,"" said Johannes Teyssen, E.On chief executive. ""We've emphasised repeatedly that we'll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability."" The company said reports from unions of 4,500 job cuts were of the correct ""order of magnitude"", but that the final figure would not be announced while it is still consulting with unions. There are around 2,500 jobs at Houghton-le-Spring, and more than 600 at each of the Hull and Worcester offices. Npower's other sites in the UK are at Leeds, Birmingham, Swindon, Solihull and Oldbury. The restructuring plan - which is set to cost Npower Â£500m - would see small businesses and consumers served by the same computer systems and customer service teams. Large industrial customers would still be served separately. This is a Goldilocks moment in the energy sector. Businesses do not want to be too big or too small to be just right. The biggest suppliers have pointed to the pressures they face on their domestic business from the energy price cap, although this has been to the benefit of millions of consumers. Legacy IT systems also cost a lot. Meanwhile, 16 small energy companies have collapsed since the beginning of last year. Many had grown too quickly, leading to terrible customer service. Their size also meant they struggled to cope with price changes on the wholesale markets. So, that leaves those in the middle, some of which have been successfully picking up domestic customers through switches and serving them through more nimble IT systems. Analysts Cornwall Insight say challenger brands now hold a 30% share of the household energy market, up from 18% two years ago. In four years, it says there could be a 50/50 split between the big six and the challengers. Npower's announcement adds some weight to that prediction. Germany-based E.On said profit for the first nine months of its financial year fell 27% to â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn). The firm said its division serving households would effectively be merged into E.On's. The government-imposed price cap had eroded profits, as it had at competitors, it said. Its division serving other businesses ""is a profitable very good business,"" it said, and would keep the Npower brand name. The GMB union said the announcement would be a ""body blow"" to Npower workers. ""Government has to urgently wake up to the impact that the price cap is having on good and reasonably well-paid jobs in UK energy companies. New UK energy giant created in SSE-Ovo deal 'Big six' energy firm to cut 900 jobs Do you work for Npower? Get in touch:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""Npower is a poorly managed company with significant losses in the UK but it's always the workers that face the brunt of poor management coupled with regulation that sends work overseas whilst sacking energy workers in the UK."" Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said the news was a ""cruel blow"" for workers. ""They've been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas. ""The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse. If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties,"" he said, urging the government to take ownership of the retail businesses of the six largest providers. Npower, one of the big six energy providers in the UK, announced plans in January to cut 900 jobs in another attempt to save costs. The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap, which began at the start of January.

"Children under the age of 12 can no longer get a criminal record Regulations have come into force raising the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland. Previously children as young as eight could be held responsible for criminal acts - the lowest in Europe and one of the lowest in the world. That has now been raised to 12, below which a child is deemed to lack the capacity to commit a crime. Campaigners said it should be raised further, and ministers said they would review the change within three years. The change followed unanimous support at Holyrood in May 2019 for theAge of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Act,external, which ministers said would be implemented quickly. It is the first change in the age of criminal responsibility since 1933 when it was raised from seven to eight. The move will mean no child under the age of 12 can now be found guilty of a criminal act. At what age should children have a criminal record? Until the change in the law, primary school children aged eight to 11 could be referred to the Children's Panel on offence grounds and could be given a criminal record. However, no child under 12 has been prosecuted in a Scottish court since 2011. The charity Action for Children said the new provisions would ensure children were treated as children within the justice system. The lowest national age of criminal responsibility is seven in India, Pakistan and Nigeria. Scotland's new threshold will be higher than the rest of UK, where it is set at 10. But some other EU states, including Portugal, Lithuania and Luxembourg have it as high as 16. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says 12 should be ""the absolute minimum""; anything lower is not considered ""internationally acceptable"". A number of Asian countries including China, Japan, North and South Korea and Vietnam set the age at 14, while some South American countries including Ecuador, Colombia and Uruguay have opted for 18. In the USA, children from the age of 11 up can be charged with a federal offence, but there are 33 states where there is no minimum age of criminal responsibility at all. Paul Carberry, Action for Children's director for Scotland, said: ""We fully support the notion that no eight to 11-year-old should ever be regarded as an offender, nor should they be stigmatised in later life as a result of actions as a child, and now this will be enshrined into law. An advisory group will consider whether the age should be raised further ""The introduction of these provisions is a major step forward and something that is far more consistent with Scotland's approach of prevention and early intervention."" Scotland's position had been widely criticised, and there have been calls for the new limit of 12 to be raised further. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child said it should be raised to 14 ""immediately"", while Bruce Adamson, the Children and Young People's Commissioner for Scotland, made his view clear that 14 was the ""lowest acceptable age."" The Scottish government said it had set up an advisory group to review the new provisions and it would consider whether the age should be raised further. Children's Minister Maree Todd said: ""These new provisions mean that the behaviour of children under 12 in Scotland will no longer result in them being treated as offenders in the children's hearings system. ""Evidence shows that responding to childhood behaviour in a criminalising, stigmatising way serves only to promote escalation and further harm. That is neither in the interests of the child, nor of the safety of our communities. ""This marks the first chapter of a ground-breaking reform. The act will deliver a progressive, child-centred approach that will make a real difference to children's lives, while victims will continue to get the support they need.""

"Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children A mother whose daughter died at Scotland's largest hospital has said her daughter would be still alive had concerns about water contamination risks been addressed in time. Kimberly Darroch was speaking after a leaked inspection report into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) revealed ""high risks"" in 2015. Milly Main, 10, contracted an infection in 2017 while on the hospital campus. She was recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. The QEUH 2015 inspection report, which ranked infection control measures as ""high risk"" in several areas just two days after the hospital opened, was passed to Labour MSP Anas Sarwar by whistleblowers. The hospital stayed open despite the warnings but has since had to close some wards for a time due to the risks from the water. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) insisted the hospital campus had a ""safe and effective water supply"" and all inspection reports had been acted upon. Warning of 'high risk' to water supply at hospital Hospital infection spiked at time of child's death Ms Darroch told BBC Scotland on Thursday night: ""I'm shocked with the information that came out today. The fact that they've known since since 2015, it's absolutely disgusting that nothing was done about it and no action was taken and the hospital was still opened. ""I believe Milly would still be here if action had been taken. I've no doubt in my mind that Milly would be sitting beside me, right now. ""There is no words to describe that pain of knowing that if things had been different, that if things had been sorted with the water, she would still be here. ""I think the health board needs to be held to account for the mistakes that they made."" She added: ""We wouldn't have been made aware of any of this if it wasn't for the whistleblower coming forward. ""I think there will continue to be shocking revelations for the foreseeable future."" Kimberly Darroch said the leaked report had ""shocked"" her A spokesperson said the Scottish government was ""examining in detail"" the separate material Mr Sarwar had highlighted. They added: ""We want to ensure that all families who have been affected can get the answers that they are clearly entitled to and the health secretary has given her personal assurance that she will ensure this happens. ""We are committed to making sure that these matters are dealt with transparently and with clear accountability, which is one of the reasons the health secretary has instructed a public inquiry in these matters to be chaired by Lord Brodie."" Ms Darroch said she was ""very angry"" and felt the health board had swept the case ""under the carpet"". A hospital complaints manager had contacted her on Thursday but she had not received an apology, she said. Milly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died days later. Her death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death butMs Darroch says the family were kept in the darkabout a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ""We are very sorry for the ongoing distress that has been caused to Ms Darroch and we want to provide parents with as much support as possible. ""We are in contact with Ms Darroch and would like to meet her to answer her questions if she would be happy to do that."" The Legionella assessment was carried out by private contractor DMA Water Treatment two days after the hospital opened In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Sarwar said he had seen figures which suggested there were 50 cases of infections at the Royal Children's Hospital - part of the Â£842m QEUH campus - between 2015 and 2018, and a further 15 unconfirmed cases so far this year. Pressed on the warnings at first minister's questions, Nicola Sturgeon said she was determined to get the ""answers parents deserve"". The documents seen by Mr Sarwar show that NHS Estates commissioned three separate independent reports into the water supply at the QEUH. The first Legionella assessment, carried out by private contractor DMA Water Treatment on 29 April 2015 - two days after the hospital welcomed its first patients - categorised the management of the bacteria as ""high risk"" because there was ""significant communication issues between the parties"" responsible for managing the risk. The problem of contaminated water is one of a number to beset the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. Last year, two cancer wards at the children's hospital were shut because of concerns about infection, and children were moved to the QEUH instead. An inquiry by Health Protection Scotland later identified 23 potential water supply-linked infections during 2018. In January it emerged two patients at the QEUH had died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings.

"The health board has centralised vascular services to a new unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd The centralisation of vascular services by a health board has prompted calls for an independent review. North Wales Community Health Council wants the inquiry to use the same methods as the one carried out over theTawel Fan unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. Betsi Cadwaladr health board consulted the public on the original plans in 2013, but did not do so this time. The health board said: ""To date no serious incidents relating to the centralisation have been reported."" What are vascular services?,external The council's chief executive, Geoff Ryall-Harvey, said: ""What we want is an independent review, one that takes into account not just clinical elements, but also views of patients and staff."" He said this should use, as a model, some aspects of the review of Tawel Fan, whichshut in 2013 amid allegations patients were mistreated. Six years ago, people were consulted over plans to centralise complex vascular services to a new unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan and close the unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd unit at Bangor - more than 30 miles away - but it did not go ahead. The health board recently revived the centralisation plan, but used the 2013 consultation. The community health council said the health board should have held a new public consultation   because of the level of public concern. It is now holding a series of engagement meetings across the region itself, and will be sending the results to the health board. The health board planned to close the unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd Mr Ryall-Harvey said: ""That's why we are having the engagement events and we will feed that into the review, we want to look at the concerns of patients and concerns of the staff and we want to know that they are taken into account as part of the review."" Vascular patient Eric Jones, from Groeslon, Gwynedd, was treated at Ysbyty Gwynedd and said the board should reverse its decision. He said: ""We had a unit at Bangor which was world class, I am seen every three months as I have an aneurism and it has to be monitored, but I am considering refusing to go to Glan Clwyd."" Fear for life over changes to hospital Vascular services overhaul confirmed Vascular service change 'risks lives' The Bangor unit was led by Prof Dean Williams, a world expert in limb salvage, but he resigned from his post earlier this year. Bethan Russell Williamsresigned from her role on the health board in protestover the decision to close the unit. Bethan Russell Williams resigned from the board She said she was fearful people were dying because centralisation was not working. ""People from Lleyn have to travel long distances and we have lost one of the most highly-respected consultants and we need to have an independent review,"" she said. The health board said it now had ""a stable, fit-for-purpose, modern vascular service"". A statement said: ""It is widely recognised that the previous service model was too stretched and did not meet national guidelines. ""We have recruited seven vascular consultants since moving forward with the change in service, and now have a sustainable on-call rota which can care for patients in need of emergency care. ""To date, no serious incidents relating to the centralisation of vascular services have been reported.

"David Duckenfield was in charge of policing the 1989 FA Cup semi-final Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has been found not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. The former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, 75, was in charge of the FA Cup semi-final in which 96 fans were fatally injured. Men, women and children were crushed on the Leppings Lane terrace. Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, was cleared after a seven-week retrial at Preston Crown Court. Due to the law at the time, there can be no prosecution over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland. This is because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. The jury at Mr Duckenfield's original trial earlier this year failed to agree a verdict. There were gasps in court as the seven women and three men on the jury returned the verdict, following 13 hours and 43 minutes of discussions. This video can not be played Margaret Aspinall reacts to Mr Duckenfield's trial verdict Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James was among those who died, said: ""The question I'd like to ask all of you and people within the system is who put 96 people in their graves, who is accountable?"" A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the verdict did not affect the findings of the Hillsborough inquests, which ruled the victims had been unlawfully killed. This video can not be played The Hillsborough match commander apologised to the families Christine Burke, whose father Henry Burke was killed in the disaster, stood in the public gallery and addressed the judge after the verdict was read out. ""With all due respect, my lord, 96 people were found unlawfully killed to a criminal standard,"" she said. ""I would like to know who is responsible for my father's death because someone is."" Reaction as David Duckenfield is cleared of manslaughter Timeline of the 1989 stadium disaster Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, died in the disaster, said: ""I'm shocked and stunned by the verdict of the jury. ""We, the families, have fought for 30 years valiantly."" Mr Duckenfield's defence counselargued the case against him was ""deeply unfair"". Benjamin Myers QC told the jury his client had become ""the focus of blame"". ""We say that is unfair, there are so many other people at fault, and so many causes,"" the barrister added. The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster The prosecution alleged Mr Duckenfield had a ""personal responsibility"" for what happened at the match. The court heard he had ordered the opening of exit gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 14:52 BST on 15 April 1989 - eight minutes before kick-off, after the area outside the turnstiles became dangerously overcrowded. More than 2,000 fans then entered through exit gate C, with many heading for the tunnel ahead of them, which led to the central pens of the terrace where the crush happened. Paul Robinson, whose brother Steven was killed in the stadium crush, said: ""As a family we would like to thank all those who have supported us over the years in our quest for justice and accountability. ""We firmly believe that we have done everything in our power to do right by our Steven and we walk away from this case with our dignity and our heads held high."" The crush developed in the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough stadium Mr Duckenfield's wife, Ann, went over to comfort her husband in the courtroom after the verdict was read out. The former match commander's solicitor, Ian Lewis, said: ""David is of course relieved that the jury has found him not guilty, however his thoughts and sympathies remain with the families of those who lost their loved ones. ""He understands the public interest in this case, but would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected, and will not be commenting further."" Clive Coleman, BBC legal affairs correspondent For a person to be found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter the prosecution has to prove that he - or she - owed a duty of care to the victim and negligently breached it. It also must be proved that it could be foreseen the breach would give rise to an obvious risk of death, that it caused the death and - most challenging of all - that the circumstances of the breach were so reprehensible as to justify the conclusion that it amounted to gross negligence and required criminal sanction. That sets the bar very high for the prosecution. The defendant's conduct must fall so far below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent and careful person in the defendant's position, that it was something truly, exceptionally bad. The CPS spokeswoman said: ""The disaster at Hillsborough 30 years ago has caused unimaginable suffering to the families of those who sadly lost their lives and to everybody affected by the tragic events of that day."" ""It is important to remember that criminal proceedings have a very different purpose to an inquest."" Liverpool FC said it shared ""the reactions and frustrations by the families today and those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy"". ""The journey that reached today's stage, and will continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice,"" the club said. ""We have immense admiration for the Hillsborough families, survivors and campaigners for what they have achieved and our thoughts remain with them and those 96 Liverpool supporters who went to watch their team and never came home."" David Duckenfield pictured in 1989, a month after the Hillsborough disaster Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, who was in overall command of Operation Resolve - the criminal inquiry into the disaster, acknowledged the jury ""had a difficult and challenging task"". ""It is right that an impartial and thorough investigation was carried out, and it is right that a jury was asked to make a judgement of the facts. What is wrong is that it has taken 30 years to get to this point. ""Thirty years means myths took root about fans being a cause of the disaster, now unequivocally shown by both defence and prosecution evidence to be wrong. And 30 years means many people, especially families, have had to constantly relive their terrible experience."" Ninety-six people were fatally injured in the 1989 disaster Relatives and friends of the victims were gathered at the Cunard Building on Liverpool's waterfront when the verdict was announced. Ms Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, thanked those who had supported the families over the past 31 years. ""I am really angry but I am trying be calm for these families who have suffered,"" she said. Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent The acquittal of David Duckenfield is the latest twist in the history of a disaster which has lasted 30 years. For all that time, the families of those who died, and the survivors of the crush, have campaigned for justice and accountability. Mr Duckenfield did not dispute that he ordered the opening of a gate at Hillsborough to let fans in, or that he failed to close the tunnel to the terraces which were already full. In 2015 at the Hillsborough Inquests he accepted that this was the direct cause of the 96 deaths. But an inquest is not a criminal court, and so it was for another jury to decide whether Mr Duckenfield's mistakes amounted to gross negligence manslaughter. The crown's case was that the Chief Superintendent's failings were so extraordinary that they met that test. But the jury accepted the defence case that the 75-year-old was a target of blame who was unfairly singled out for prosecution. He will now be able to resume his life in retirement on the south coast. But the Hillsborough families and survivors will find the outcome hard to takeâ¦ and will ask hard questions about the Â£65m spent on a criminal investigation which has ended with no one convicted for so many lives lost.

"A US woman who says she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York aged 17 has given her first UK television interview - on Monday's BBC Panorama. Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says both she and Prince Andrew ""know what happened"". The prince ""categorically"" denies having any sexual contact with her. Earlier the Met Police defended its decision not to probe a trafficking claim by Ms Giuffre against Epstein. The force said it stood by its conclusion that it was ""not the appropriate authority"" to investigate the American woman's claims. Ms Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Buckingham Palace has described the allegations as ""false and without any foundation"". In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlisearlier this month, the prince said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". In a special hour-long Panorama,to be aired on BBC One on 2 Decemberbut recorded before the Newsnight interview, Ms Giuffre says: ""It was a really scary time in my life. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash following an the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He has stepped back from royal dutiesbecause the Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. He later said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. In a statement, the prince said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. During his Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said that on the night she claims they first met he had gone to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. Ms Giuffre's latest comments form part of a longer investigation by Panorama into the Epstein scandal and the prince's links with the convicted child sex offender. During the programme, BBC reporter Darragh MacIntyre will also look at another of the prince's friends, Ghislaine Maxwell, investigating her alleged links to the Epstein scandal. Earlier on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police defended its decision not to investigate a claim of trafficking by Ms Giuffre. She says the force failed to check her allegation that she had been trafficked to London in 2001 by Epstein. Commander Alex Murray said that after taking legal advice, ""it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK"". The Met reviewed that decision after Epstein died in US custody earlier this year. Commander Murray said that ""our position remains unchanged"".

"Nigel Farage on the campaign trail in Hartlepool, County Durham He's a pro. To watch Nigel Farage in front of a crowd of believers is to witness a well-honed performance. He's in uniform - tweed jacket, tan corduroy trousers, check shirt, knitted red tie, every garment a cultural signal. He jokes with the crowd, and they laugh happily. He invokes the enemy, successively the Lib Dems (hiss), Diane Abbott (laughter), Theresa May (groan) Jeremy Corbyn (boo!). The crowd enjoys it so much, he warns he may have to close the bar, heh-heh-ing to himself as he segues into a pledge of a better future for the fishing industry (this is Grimsby in mid-November, and Farage is on a campaign visit). By the time the Brexit Party leader finishes, with a flailing attack on a corrupt, out-of-date political system, the audience is eating out of his hand. A few days later, in front of a more hostile BBC Question Time audience, he's equally practised. He's done that side of electioneering plenty of times - and maybe the gestures are a bit choppier and the posture less relaxed, but he has been beleaguered in a studio before. No, he's not a racist, and the Brexit Party has an impressively diverse team of candidates, he says. No, he doesn't want to privatise the NHS - but he would like to see more better-off people taking out private health insurance to cut the burden on taxpayers, and he is unimpressed by concerns that this might undermine the principle of a universal service. He wants to limit immigration because the population is rising too fast. Yes, the future outside the EU is bright. Those who expected a cartoon ogre may not be converted, but he's not quite what they expected. Nigel Farage is a political force in his own right - a creator of parties, not a cog within them. That rare sub-species of politician seen by voters as distinctive. He took UKIP - the party he led three times over the course of 20 years, but left last year - from the political fringe to centre stage by stitching together a coalition of angry voters from across normal party lines. In the process, he cornered David Cameron into promising the 2016 referendum. Just four months after he set up the Brexit Party, in February, it topped the polls in the 2019 European Parliamentary elections. This sent him back to Strasbourg for a fifth term as an MEP. Brexit is his baby, if anyone is the father. And those who know Farage well understand his very human reluctance to see someone else dandling his baby on their knee. Part of his fury at the political establishment is because they always treated him with disdain, never acknowledged the scale of his achievement, and now the Conservative leadership want to co-opt it. ""You can make a convincing case that Nigel Farage is the most influential politician of the modern era,"" says Professor Matthew Goodwin, an academic who has studied the rise of UKIP. ""He is responsible for mainstreaming Euroscepticism, bringing about the 2016 referendum and then delivering the vote for Brexit - and it's all the more impressive because he never reached the House of Commons. But maybe the price of that is that he has eroded British political culture and, for his critics, he has eroded consensus and civility."" So how did he do it? One close colleague says he has the strengths (and weaknesses) of his former career as a commodities trader. ""He can spot openings in a market and take snap decisions, but he does not think strategically. He thinks and acts on the spur of the moment, as you would expect of a trader."" Nigel Farage drinks a pint as he visits Seaham, 2019 The gap in the market was for a radical-right populist in a politics dominated by Oxbridge-educated political professionals. Farage may be a prosperous, public-school educated MEP, who can look forward to a generous European Parliament pension after his 20 years in Strasbourg, but his language, style and character were shaped to appeal to working-class blokes and middle-class Eurosceptics. His clothes, his talk about World War Two, the drinking and the laddish vibe all appeal to disaffected voters who don't connect with the elite of orthodox politics. Nigel Paul Farage was born 3 April 1964 in Kent. His stockbroker father was an alcoholic and walked out on the family when Nigel was five. Farage attended fee-paying school Dulwich College in south-east London. At 18, he got a job as a trader in the City. In his 20s Farage was run over by a car, sustaining major injuries. He married his nurse, Grainne Hayes, in 1986. In 1992, he left the Conservatives in protest at the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. In 1993 he became a founding member of UKIP. Farage was elected to the European Parliament in 1999. The same year he married his second wife Kirsten Mehr. He resigned as UKIP leader to stand in the 2010 general election. On election day, Farage was seriously injured in a plane crash. In 2014, Farage led UKIP to the largest share of the vote in the European election. In 2019, Farage stood down from UKIP and launched the Brexit Party. Douglas Carswell, a Conservative MP who defected to UKIP and the only person ever elected under a UKIP banner at a general election, says Farage is driven by his cause: ""If you asked Cameron, or [Gordon] Brown, or Theresa May, why they wanted to be prime minister, they would give you vague answers about being good at the job. Nigel genuinely went into politics to get us out of the European Union. He's the only other leader in my lifetime, apart from Margaret Thatcher, who had a sense of mission which extended beyond themselves."" Farage was one of the first to realise that immigration was becoming a big issue, and he was one of the first to register the alienation in heartland Labour constituencies, where voters, perhaps, felt taken for granted by New Labour. He talks about how at the Oldham by-election of 2011 he walked through the streets and realised those votes were up for grabs, because, he thought, Labour was no longer connected to the concerns of their heartland voters. It was Ed Miliband's decision not to commit to an EU referendum in 2015 that allowed UKIP to take four million votes, many from Labour, in crucial marginal seats. That tilted the electoral balance and allowed David Cameron to win in 2015, but only at the price of committing himself to a referendum. The Brexit Party policy offer is centred on the idea of a challenge to the establishment, in what the party calls a contract with the people (an idea that echoes the Republican Contract with America which won them the 1994 congressional elections). The focus is on ditching what they see as unpopular ideas foisted on an unwilling population by an unaccountable elite. Out goes HS2, the high-speed rail line, the apprenticeship levy and interest charges on student loans. In come promises of investment in left-behind Britain and policies to revive the High Street. There's a particular promise to regenerate fishing communities. Farage is often criticised for his poor attendance record as a member of the European Parliament fisheries committee - one out of a possible 42 meetings. He has said the committee is ""pointless"" and has no legislative or policy role. There's a pledge to invest in strategic industries and create thousands of jobs in steel, railways and defence. Above all, there's a pledge to cap immigration at 50,000 people per year. It all speaks very directly at the areas where UKIP had its greatest electoral success - and where the Brexit Party hopes to inherit that vote. Brexit Party MEPs turn their backs during the European anthem ahead of the inaugural session at the European Parliament, 2019 The former Labour MP John Woodcock who saw UKIP take nearly 12% in his Leave-voting seat, Barrow-in-Furness, in 2015, said Labour campaigners found Farage a frustrating target. This was because lines of attack about his long and lucrative tenure in the European Parliament, and his privileged background, simply didn't stick to him. At the same time, he was perfectly capable of attacking others for being children of privilege, or for doing well out of a career in the EU. ""For all our efforts, he's still seen as someone who speaks truth to power and represents the basic anti-Europeanism that many traditional Labour voters feel,"" Woodcock - who recently announced he would be voting Conservative in the election - said. ""Over the years he has managed to tap into concerns about immigration that are felt in places like Barrow, despite it being 99.4% white British."" Another ex-Labour MP for a Leave seat analyses his appeal: ""White working-class voters are very angry, feel left behind by globalisation and think things are done to them with no-one asking - immigration, their way of life is threatened, and they're told it's redundant or even racist. Nigel Farage speaking in Hartlepool, 2019 ""Nigel Farage would not seem to be their natural spokesman, but he is - he's angry about the same things, he speaks to their patriotism, and he doesn't bang on about market forces, which matters because for a lot of people outside London, their experience of market forces is pretty negative. It's one reason why a lot of Conservative rhetoric doesn't impress them. ""He may be a public schoolboy, but they would send their children to a private school if they could afford it, and he also reaches a group of middle-class voters who are further to the right than many people realise."" And perhaps that sense of identification is why allegations against him don't seem to stick. And there have been plenty. Most spectacularly, he had to deny placing currency bets against sterling on the night of the EU referendum, after he wrongly conceded victory to the Remain camp. His spokesperson insisted Farage ""had no financial interest in currency movements on the night of Brexit"", after claims that currency speculators used inaccurate early predictions of a Remain victory to profit by short-selling the pound. There have also been questions about who funds his personal expenses, and about his European Parliament expenses, but they seem to simply bounce off him. As well as being firmly denied, they don't matter to his core supporters. The other side of that coin is a certain toxicity. In the past he has been accused of scare-mongering, xenophobia and, by some, inciting hatred.  During the 2016 referendum, a great deal of the internal politics of the Leave campaign was about limiting Farage's visibility, so as not to frighten off swing voters. Others argue that the Leave vote needed to mobilise both undecided voters and Farage supporters to succeed. If his voters had stayed at home, the Leave vote would not have been delivered - so perhaps there were some advantages in there being two campaigns, speaking to different constituencies, with different voices. One of Farage's quirks is his reliance on a cadre of highly committed activists, usually younger men like press officer Dan Jukes, or Chris Bruni-Lowe, the former UKIP campaign director who holds the same position in the Brexit Party. In small-party politics, that mattered because he didn't have a vast structure to call on. And he frequently leant on a chief wingman, successively party stalwart Andy Reid, then the self-styled ""Bad Boy of Brexit"" Arron Banks, and now the property developer and millionaire, Richard Tice. They're not underlings, they're people who he looks up to, and whose advice he listens to. Bankshelped bankroll Farageto the tune of Â£450,000 in the year after the Brexit referendum - paying for his London home, his car and trips to the US to meet Donald Trump - saying it was an ""honour to help"". Nigel Farage and Dan Jukes (right), London, 2017 The quality of Farage's output varies with the quality of his wingmen. His tactical errors often stemmed from his taking bad advice from the wingman of the day - in particular, colleagues point to his flirtation with Steve Bannon, the guru of the American populist right, who managed Trump's presidential campaign. That connection made Farage the first British politician to meet the then President-elect Trump, who suggested he should become the ambassador to Washington, and later urged the Conservatives to strike an election pact with the Brexit Party. Farage, for his part, suggested that Trump's peace initiative to North Korea merited a Nobel Peace Prize. Leader profiles Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Even after Bannon left the White House, Farage remained in contact with the president - one associate suspects they exchange direct messages via Twitter. But the influence of Bannon, critics say, was behind Farage's remark about Aids-infected immigrants in a televised election debate in 2015. He said Britain should not be spending money on health tourism, adding: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV, and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to Â£25,000 per year per patient. What we need to do is to put the NHS there for British people and families, who in many cases have paid into the system for decades."" Donald Trump greets Nigel Farage at the Mississippi Coliseum, Jackson, 2016 UKIP hit the big time when it topped the poll in the 2014 elections to the European Parliament. That attracted serious talent and serious money to the party - but it also exposed a major Farage flaw. He could sense on instinct when public opinion was moving, but he struggled to build an effective party organisation. There was a conflict between his insistence on maintaining control and his waning attention span when confronted with the endless detail and the endless trade-offs of building a political machine. This is where the wingmen became crucial - they would speak with his voice, and the words ""Nigel wants"" were usually decisive. But the wingmen could come and go, and the decisions relayed to the party could change with them. Sometimes the internal mantra was not ""what Nigel wants, Nigel gets,"" but ""Nigel is our greatest asset and our greatest liability"". Farage's frustration with those party machine issues shows in the design of the Brexit Party. Its chairman, the long term Farage ally, Richard Tice, compares it to a fast-growing tech start-up. Farage calls the shots, with no tiresome committees of stubborn party worthies to get in the way. That allows him to pivot to a new position with dizzying speed. UKIP could never have decided on a Monday afternoon to stand down 300 candidates, and just do it. It would have taken six months of infighting to get something like that through its internal structure. Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of the Brexit Party, Coventry, 2019 And, incidentally, his decision to abandon UKIP and set up an entirely new organisation gave the lie to his claims that it was not a one-man band. The ""left behind"" voters he had won for UKIP followed him, and his former party imploded in his wake. But is his magic fading? In 2015 UKIP attracted four million votes. But for this, they only got one MP - and it wasn't N Farage. In this election, insurgency has been harder. Brexit is the policy of the Conservative government, and that forces Farage into more nuanced arguments about its version of Brexit as opposed to his. At those election rallies he sounded much more comfortable bashing Remainers. Then there was his decision not to contest a Commons seat himself. Having failed to win the election in Eastleigh in 1994, Salisbury (1997), Bexhill and Battle (2001), South Thanet (2005 - his first attempt at the seat), Buckingham (2010) and finally South Thanet again in 2015, John Woodcock wonders if there might be a kind of glass ceiling to his appeal. ""It's interesting that someone with his star quality can't get elected, it gives me some solace about the instincts of the voters."" A plane carrying Nigel Farage crashed on the day of the 2010 general election when its UKIP-promoting banner became entangled in the tail fin In fairness, the other parties threw everything into their efforts to prevent Farage reaching Parliament in 2015, not least because he had pledged to resign as leader if he was not elected. His defeat was bruising and dispiriting, and he would have faced the same problems of fighting an intense constituency battle while also leading a national campaign, wherever he might have run this time. Another factor is that, until now, he has faced Conservative leaders who couldn't match his appeal to those Brexity, working-class and traditional Tory voters. John Major wanted to be at the heart of Europe, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard did toy with Farage-esque populism, but didn't convince. David Cameron was a liberal centrist, and Theresa May's initial ""Iron Lady"" appeal corroded rapidly. But Boris Johnson is a direct rival for the hearts and minds Farage had claimed as his own. ""Farage will say he thinks Johnson and Johnsonism are over-rated, but the reality is that he's now up against a charismatic politician who can match him,"" says one long-standing Brexit campaigner. An early sign was Farage's inability to pin the blame for the postponement of Brexit on the prime minister - part of the reason for that was that there wasn't a group of hard Brexit Conservative MPs willing to attack the government's new-look Brexit deal as BRINO (Brexit in Name Only). There's a parasitical co-dependent relationship between the Brexiteer Tory right and Farage. He does best when they're crying betrayal and amplifying his message to Conservative voters, that they've been let down by their leaders, once again. What next? Will he be able to revive the Brexit Party if there is no Brexit or an unsatisfactory Brexit? His decision to stand down Brexit Party candidates in Conservative seats infuriated some of his supporters, and provoked open rebellion among a few. It may be hard to get the band back together again. Despite his confident exterior, this is the first time Farage has found himself on the defensive, but he continues to insist that the Brexit Party is needed, although after the UK leaves, it might need to be re-branded. And John Woodcock is struck by the ""remarkable"" way the UKIP/Brexit Party electoral coalition has on occasion ""collapsed in on itself"" and then re-assembled, particularly for mid-term elections like those for the European Parliament. Nigel Farage campaigning in Plymouth, 2019 But before that, there's a general election. And even if the Brexit Party fails to gain a single seat, its intervention (or non-intervention) could tip the balance in hundreds of constituencies. Might an over-enthusiastic campaign actually prevent a Tory victory, lead on to a hung parliament and then to a second referendum? Farage's sense of ownership of Brexit is deeply, deeply personal, and makes it hard to let go, and stand aside to allow Boris Johnson to deliver it.  So could the man who spent 30 years in the wilderness arguing for Brexit ultimately be the man who stops it happening altogether? The question is whether he knows when to stop, or is even capable of stopping. There are, Farage-watchers say, two Nigels: Nice Nigel and Nasty Nigel. They reflect the fun, patriotic, Del Boy side of populism, and its angrier flipside - in other words, the charismatic, optimistic, Happy Warrior or the angry populist Dark Knight. And this election could still turn on which one emerges in this campaign. All photos subject to copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"A manuscript written by Queen Elizabeth I has been discovered after lying unnoticed for more than a century. A literary historian from the University of East Anglia made the startling find in Lambeth Palace Library in London. He turned detective to piece together a series of clues to establish that the queen was the author of the writings. The work is a translation of a book in which the Roman historian Tacitus wrote of the benefits of monarchical rule. The manuscript contains clues to the queen's identity as its author It was while searching in the library for translations of Tacitus that Dr John-Mark Philo found the mysterious 42-page manuscript. He established it was written on a very specific kind of paper, which had ""gained special prominence"" in the Tudor Court in the 1590s. ""There was, however, only one translator at the Tudor court to whom a translation of Tacitus was ascribed by a contemporary, and who was using the same paper in her translations and private correspondence - the queen herself,"" added Dr Philo. A further clue was the presence of three watermarks - a rampant lion and the initials G.B with a crossbow countermark - which are also found on the paper Elizabeth I used in her personal correspondence. But the clinching argument was the handwriting. The translation was copied by one of her secretaries but it is covered in corrections and additions which match the queen's highly distinctive, indeed rather messy, hand. Queen Elizabeth I coronation glove to go on show Dress linking Elizabeth I to Welsh confidante displayed Elizabeth I Armada portrait saved with help of 8,000 donors ""The corrections made to the translation are a match for Elizabeth's late hand, which was, to put it mildly, idiosyncratic,"" said Dr Philo. ""The higher you are in the social hierarchy of Tudor England, the messier you can let your handwriting become. For the queen, comprehension is somebody else's problem."" It also shows corrections made by her own hand Dr Philo suggested the monarch might have been studying the text for guidance on how to rule. The translation is from Tacitus's history of the Roman Empire and traces the death of Augustus, the rise of the Emperor Tiberius and the centralisation of power in a single individual. Dr Philo said Tacitus ""has always been considered the subversive historian, and was later reviled under Charles I as anti-monarchical"", which raises questions about why it would be of interest to Elizabeth. Was she drawing upon it for guidance on how to rule or for examples of misrule to be avoided? Alternatively, the translation could just have been a hobby for a queen who is known to have enjoyed classical history. The manuscript has been at Lambeth since the 17th Century but it is the first time the author has been identified. Elizabeth I's Translation of Tacitus is published on 29 November 2019 in the Review of English Studies. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or atbbcnewsents,external.

"A US woman who says she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York aged 17 has given her first UK television interview - on Monday's BBC Panorama. Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says both she and Prince Andrew ""know what happened"". The prince ""categorically"" denies having any sexual contact with her. Earlier the Met Police defended its decision not to probe a trafficking claim by Ms Giuffre against Epstein. The force said it stood by its conclusion that it was ""not the appropriate authority"" to investigate the American woman's claims. Ms Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Buckingham Palace has described the allegations as ""false and without any foundation"". In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlisearlier this month, the prince said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". In a special hour-long Panorama,to be aired on BBC One on 2 Decemberbut recorded before the Newsnight interview, Ms Giuffre says: ""It was a really scary time in my life. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash following an the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He has stepped back from royal dutiesbecause the Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. He later said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. In a statement, the prince said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. During his Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said that on the night she claims they first met he had gone to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. Ms Giuffre's latest comments form part of a longer investigation by Panorama into the Epstein scandal and the prince's links with the convicted child sex offender. During the programme, BBC reporter Darragh MacIntyre will also look at another of the prince's friends, Ghislaine Maxwell, investigating her alleged links to the Epstein scandal. Earlier on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police defended its decision not to investigate a claim of trafficking by Ms Giuffre. She says the force failed to check her allegation that she had been trafficked to London in 2001 by Epstein. Commander Alex Murray said that after taking legal advice, ""it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK"". The Met reviewed that decision after Epstein died in US custody earlier this year. Commander Murray said that ""our position remains unchanged"".

"Hillsborough remains the worst disaster in British sporting history On a sunny spring afternoon in 1989, a crush developed at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield resulting in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans attending the club's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. It remains the UK's worst sporting disaster. Since then, many families and survivors have led a 30-year campaign to discover how and why they died. Here are some of the key events. 15 April 1989:Fans gather at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground amid a ""carnival atmosphere"". The mood is described as ""boisterous"" but jovial. As kick-off approaches, a large crowd builds up outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Following an urgent request to relieve the pressure, match commander Ch Supt David Duckenfield gives the order to open an exit gate. Two thousand Liverpool fans enter via a tunnel on to already-packed terraces. A severe crush develops in the central pens and people are pulled out in a ""human cascade"". Ninety-six men, women and children lose their lives with hundreds more injured. The oldest victim was 67, the youngest just 10 years old. April 1989:As the disaster unfolds, Ch Supt Duckenfield tells key people that a gate was ""forced"" by Liverpool fans, a claim reinforced in briefings to media sources. The lie goes around the world, in TV and radio news bulletins. Newspapers take up the story pointing the finger at ""drunk and ticketless"" supporters. The Sun prints its now infamous front page alleging Liverpool fans had ""urinated on police officers"" and ""picked the pockets of the dead"". The tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4 was directly opposite the turnstiles January 1990:A judicial inquiry is held into the tragedy. Lord Justice Taylor's report concludes the failure to close off the tunnel was ""a blunder of the first magnitude"" and match commander David Duckenfield ""failed to take effective control"". His final report recommends a move to all-seater stadia, which leads to a ban on standing at football matches, eventually imposed on all clubs in the top two divisions in 1994. August 1990:The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) rules out bringing criminal charges against Sheffield Wednesday FC, Sheffield City Council and stadium safety engineers Eastwoods. It is a blow for the families who had hoped someone would be held accountable. March 1991:The original inquests into the deaths prove hugely controversial. Coroner Dr Stefan Popper rules out any evidence relating to fans' deaths beyond 3.15pm because, by this time, he said ""the damage was done"". This is ""strongly disputed"" by bereaved families. November 1991:David Duckenfield is medically retired from South Yorkshire Police on full pension, two years after being suspended from duty. A police doctor diagnoses him with ""severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder"". Donna Miller, with a picture of her brother, Paul Carlile, who was 19 when he died at Hillsborough March 1993:The 96th victim of the Hillsborough disaster, Tony Bland, dies after being left severely brain damaged in the crush. After nearly four years in a persistent vegetative state, life support is removed after a legal battle. He was 18 at the time of the tragedy but 22 when he died. December 1996:Hillsborough, a controversial drama-documentary by acclaimed Liverpool writer Jimmy McGovern, reveals new evidence claiming some of the 96 were still alive after 3.15pm. Researchers also track down Roger Houldsworth, the stadium's video technician, who said it should have been ""obvious"" to police that the pens were ""very, very full"" when gate C was opened. February 2000:In a bid to hold someone criminally responsible for the deaths of the 96, the Hillsborough Families Support Group begins a private prosecution. David Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray are charged with manslaughter and misconduct in public office. The jury acquits Mr Murray and, after they fail to reach a verdict on Mr Duckenfield, the judge imposes a ""stay of prosecution"" saying he should not face a retrial. April 2009:At the 20th Hillsborough memorial event at Anfield, fans heckle the then Culture Secretary Andy Burnham demanding ""justice for the 96"". Their anger prompts the MP, an Everton fan from Merseyside who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, to join calls for any information held by public bodies on Hillsborough to be made released. A 140,000-signature petition forces a Commons debate leading to the full disclosure of 300,000 documents. A memorial at Anfield remembers the 96 fans who died January 2010:The Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) is appointed to review previously unseen evidence. September 2012:After sitting for two years, the HIP publishes a damning report into the tragedy. It is highly critical of the emergency response by a number of organisations and blames senior officers for opening exit gates without thinking about what would happen. September 2012:Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie offers ""profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool"" for blaming fans for the Hillsborough tragedy. He says ""I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong."" Trevor Hicks, of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, says it was ""too little, too late"". December 2012:The High Court quashes the original inquest verdicts that had stood for more than 20 years. Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge also orders new inquests after the HIP report said 41 of those who died might have been saved. Then home secretary Theresa May announces a new police inquiry into the disaster. April 2013:The families' joy at the quashing of the original inquest verdicts is tempered by the death of campaigner Anne Williams from cancer at the age of 60. She never believed her son Kevin, and 94 others, were dead by 3.15pm on the day of the disaster and led calls to have verdicts overturned. March 2014:The new Hillsborough inquests open in Warrington and last for two years - the longest inquests in UK legal history. March 2015:After six days of questioning, David Duckenfield admits his failure to close a tunnel before opening gate C ""was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 people"". Under pressure, he ""froze"" and failed to consider the consequences of admitting thousands of fans on to already-packed terraces, he told the jury. David Duckenfield gave evidence to the fresh Hillsborough inquests in 2015 April 2016:Hillsborough Inquests conclude the 96 who died in the 1989 disaster were unlawfully killed. Jurors agree fans played no part in the deaths and instead blame police failures, stadium design faults, and a delayed response by the ambulance service. Families celebrate as they emerge from court. June 2017:The Crown Prosecution Service announces David Duckenfield is to be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 people. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. June 2017:Five other men also face charges: Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell is charged with safety offences; former South Yorkshire Police (SYP) chief inspector Sir Norman Bettison is charged with four counts of misconduct in public office; former SYP solicitor Peter Metcalf and former SYP officers Donald Denton and Alan Foster are charged with perverting the course of justice. June 2018:An order imposed in 2000 preventing Mr Duckenfield from being tried on charges relating to Hillsborough is lifted. August 2018:All charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans for the disaster, are dropped because of insufficient evidence. January 2019:The first Hillsborough trial begins at Preston Crown Court. Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Graham Mackrell denies two health and safety offences, one of which is later dropped due to lack of evidence. April 2019:The jury fails to return a verdict on the manslaughter charge against Mr Duckenfield. Prosecutors say they will seek a retrial. Jurors did find Mackrell guilty by majority on a health and safety charge relating to the adequate provision of turnstiles on the day. November 2019:After a six-week trial at Preston Crown Court, David Duckenfield is found not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. April 2021:Trial of retired Ch Supt Donald Denton, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster and former South Yorkshire Police solicitor Peter Metcalf accused of altering police statements after the disaster opens at the Nightingale Court at the Lowry Theatre, Salford. May 2021:Mr Denton, Mr Foster and Mr Metcalf are acquitted of perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice William Davis ruled they had no case to answer. July 2021:Andrew Devine, who suffered life-changing injuries in the crush, dies at the age of 55. A coroner rules later that month that he had been unlawfully killed.

"Melania Geymonat (right) and her date Chris needed hospital treatment Three teenage boys have admitted threatening two women who refused to kiss each other on a bus. Melania Geymonat, 28, and her date Christine Hannigan were pelted with coins on a Camden night bus on 30 May. The teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, had previously denied charges of harassment by using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. They admitted the public order offences ahead of a scheduled trial at Highbury Corner Youth Court. The 17-year-old will appear in court on Friday for a Newton hearing, to decide whether an aggravating factor of homophobia should be considered on sentencing. All three boys will be sentenced at the same court on 23 December. This video can not be played 'I was and still am angry at bus attack' Prosecutor Saira Khan said the teenagers each played different roles in the nine-minute incident. Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan were initially sitting alone on the top deck of the N31 bus when they were approached by the group of boys. The women were surrounded and sexual gestures were made by the teenagers. CCTV showed a fight breaking out on the bus, with both Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan being punched several times. The suspects also left with a phone and a bag. It was alleged the boys threw coins at the women, who were both taken to hospital for treatment to facial injuries. In addition to the public order offences, a 16-year-old boy also pleaded guilty to handling a stolen mobile phone while a 15-year-old boy admitted handling a stolen bank card. Judge Susan Williams said the abuse ""was quite clearly directed towards this couple because of who they are"". Transport for London's Mandy McGregor said after the hearing: ""This sickening incident was utterly unacceptable. Homophobic abuse is a hate crime and won't be tolerated on our network."" Police said charges were dropped against another 17-year-old boy. Speaking after the attack in May, Ms Hannigan told the BBC she was ""not scared to be visibly queer"". ""If anything, you should do it more,"" she added. Ms Geymonat, who is a qualified doctor but works for Ryanair as a flight attendant, said she agreed. Ms Hannigan said: ""I was and still am angry. It was scary, but this is not a novel situation.""

"Almost a quarter of young people are so dependent on their smartphones that it becomes like an addiction, suggests research by psychiatrists. The study, from King's College London, says such addictive behaviour means that people become ""panicky"" or ""upset"" if they are denied constant access. The youngsters also cannot control the amount of time they spend on the phone. The study warns that such addictions have ""serious consequences"" for mental health. The research, published in BMC Psychiatry, analysed 41 studies involving 42,000 young people in an investigation into ""problematic smartphone usage"". The study found 23% had behaviour that was consistent with an addiction - such as anxiety over not being able to use their phone, not being able to moderate the time spent and using mobiles so much that it was detrimental to other activities. Confessions of a smartphone addict 'Phone-free Fridays' to keep young off mobiles Half of parents want mobile phones banned in school Such addictive behaviour could be linked to other problems, says the study, such as stress, a depressed mood, lack of sleep and reduced achievement in school. ""Smartphones are here to stay and there is a need to understand the prevalence of problematic smartphone usage,"" says one of the report's authors, Nicola Kalk, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London. ""We don't know whether it is the smartphone itself that can be addictive or the apps that people use,"" said Dr Kalk. ""Nevertheless, there is a need for public awareness around smartphone use in children and young people, and parents should be aware of how much time their children spend on their phones."" Co-author Samantha Sohn warned that addictions ""can have serious consequences on mental health and day-to-day functioning, so there is a need for further investigation into problematic smartphone usage"". But Amy Orben, research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge, warned against assuming there were causal connections between problematic smartphone use and outcomes such as depression. ""It has been shown previously that smartphone effects are not a one-way street, but that mood can impact the amount of smartphone use, as well,"" said Dr Orben.
