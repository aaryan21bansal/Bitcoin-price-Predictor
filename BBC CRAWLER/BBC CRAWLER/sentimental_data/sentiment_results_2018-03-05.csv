"Frances McDormand said she had ""two words"" for the Oscars audience - ""inclusion rider"" If this year's Oscars are remembered for anything, it may be for making the term ""inclusion rider"" common parlance. Mentioned by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech, it refers to a clause actors can insist be added to their contracts. ""[It] means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50% diversity, not only in casting but also [in] the crew,"" she explained backstage afterwards. Its mention prompted a dramatic surge of interest in the term on Google. Many people also searched for inclusion ""writer"", having misheard the final sentence of McDormand's rousing address. McDormand said she had only become aware of the term recently. But it's actually been around since 2016. It was coined by media researcher Stacy Smith ina TED talk,externalshe gave that year, in which she posited ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. This video can not be played Inclusion rider creator: 'It's a new day' after Frances McDormand's Oscar speech Dr Smith came up with the concept with Kalpana Kotagal, a civil rights and employment practice attorney in Washington DC, and the producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni. The University of Southern California professor argues that an ""equity clause"" in an A-list actor's contract could allow the film's minor on-screen roles ""to match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place"". Speaking to an audience in San Francisco, Dr Smith said: ""The typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it. I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story. ""The remaining 30 or so roles, there's no reason why those minor roles can't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place. ""An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live."" Brie Larson, pictured with Frances McDormand at the SAG awards, has pledged her support Speaking after the awards, Dr Smith said the mention had come as a ""complete surprise"" and that she was ""utterly elated"" that McDormand - who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - had so publicly championed her proposal. ""The goal is that talent can take the inclusion rider and adopt it in ways that make sense for their values and their beliefs,""she told The Guardian,external. The good news is that some A-listers are already taking the initiative when it comes to using their position to negotiate a more representative work space. ""I'm committed to the Inclusion Rider,""tweeted Brie Larson,external, Oscar-winning star of Room and the forthcoming Captain Marvel. ""Who's with me?""

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south. The centre-left coalition, dominated by the Democratic Party, was punished in traditional strongholds including Emilia-Romagna, the northern region home to the city of Bologna. Voter turnout was estimated at 73% on Monday morning, according to interior ministry figures. Though no party will be able to rule alone based on latest results, the surge of support for populist parties has been compared with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. The right-wing alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy, is tipped to get 248-268 seats - below the 316 needed for a majority. But Five Star will emerge as the largest single party in Italy's lower house, with 216-236 seats. The party was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian election: Its economy in charts Immigration dominates Italian election Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Italian voters appear to have abandoned Mr Renzi's Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is projected to come a distant third, with an estimated 107-127 seats. Immigration and the economy have been two of the key issues for voters during the election. More than 600,000 migrants have travelled from Libya to reach Italy since 2013, which has upset many Italians. The state of the economy was also at the centre of the debates. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate, the upper house of parliament, also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was forecast to take the most seats - around 102-122 - but miss out on a majority. The right-wing coalition is predicted to get 118-150 seats in the upper house, and the Democratic Party 42-54. By James Reynolds BBC News, Milan We still don't know who the winner will be. But in this opening act, Five Star has gained a certain advantage. Its message clearly resonated with young people searching for jobs, and with voters in the poorer south of the country. Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party is among the losers in this election The movement made a big point of running alone in this election. By contrast, other major parties teamed up into electoral alliances. But the feature which gave the party its strength - its independence - may now become its weakness. In order to form a government, Five Star must find coalition partners. Its inexperience in working with others may be a disadvantage in the practical business of coalition-building. So, which way will Five Star seek to turn? There is some speculation that the movement may seek a coalition with the League. Both parties have criticised Italy's relationship with the European Union, although neither campaigns to leave the bloc. A potential alliance between the two would be viewed with some degree of worry in Brussels. The vote comes as a blow to Silvio Berlusconi, 81, whose party led the right-wing coalition. But now Matteo Salvini has laid claim to that role. He has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and spoken of the ""danger"" of Islam. ""My first words: THANK YOU,"" tweeted Mr Salvini as projections rolled in. In any case Mr Berlusconi cannot hold public office himself until next year because of a tax fraud conviction. This video can not be played From 2018: Berlusconi's handshake advice for BBC reporter The leader of the League is a proud Eurosceptic, who has praised Brexit and voiced opposition to the euro in the past. ""It's a fantastic victory which fills us with pride,"" said Mr Salvini on Monday as results came in. He claimed Italian voters had ""made a step forward to be free from the cages and ties that are bringing back hunger and insecurity in Europe"". In the same speech, Mr Salvini repeated his stance that the euro is bad for Italy. ""It's a wrong currency and a wrong choice,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Republicans have raised concern about the US president's plan to impose tariffs on metals, with the party's top lawmaker calling for it to be scrapped. US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he was ""extremely worried"" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. But Mr Trump pushed back during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We're not backing down,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""I don't think you're going to have a trade war,"" he said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday that President Trump was ""very confident"" the US would win any trade war. Mr Trump's Monday comments came an hour after Mr Ryan released a statement urging the White House to reconsider its plan. This video can not be played Trump: 'We can't do business in the EU' ""We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,"" Mr Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. ""The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardise those gains."" Mr Trump's announcement last week that he would tax imported steel and aluminium has prompted worldwide reaction. Kamal Ahmed: Why Trump is playing tough on trade The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday also called on member states to ""stop the fall of the first dominoes"" of a trade war. ""Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told negotiators in Geneva on Monday. ""An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Trump hinted that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for tariffs on US neighbours.

Those tariffs could be removed for Canada and Mexico if they signed a ""new and fair"" agreement, he suggested. The current round of Nafta talks, which focus on updating the 24-year old treaty, are due to finish on Monday and have achieved little. Mr Trump has decried the US trade deficit with other countries, which he has blamed on ""'very stupid' trade deals and policies"". On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. He issued a threat against EU-made cars on Saturday, which he repeated during his Oval Office meeting with the Israeli prime minister on Monday. ""They have trade barriers that are worse than tariffs. They also have tariffs by the way, but they have trade barriers far worse than tariffs."" ""And if they want to do something we'll just tax their cars that they send in here like water,"" he vowed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Over the weekend some Republicans began to question the tariff proposal and have urged the president to reconsider. Many argue that the impact of tax cuts that were passed earlier this year will be wiped out as countries levy new tariffs on US goods and the price of metals climbs. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, adding that Mr Trump's ""action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books"". Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Representatives from Canada, Mexico and the US meet to discuss Nafta agreement in January Responding to the criticism on CNN, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the number of Republicans opposed Mr Trump's tariff plan. ""Guess what: He beat them,"" Mr Navarro said, referring to the outcome of the 2016 election. He added that Republicans are ""dead wrong on the economics"". Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. Levi jeans and bourbon could be hit with a 25% import tax by the European Union if Mr Trump imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade, told the BBC the items were on a draft list of US goods to be taxed. This video can not be played Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade Ms MalmstrÃ¶m told the BBC: ""We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union."" Why Trump is hanging tough on trade What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had ""forcefully defended"" Canadian industry in a phone call to Mr Trump on Monday, his office said. A spokesman described the conversation as ""constructive"" but gave no details. Canada has warned that tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Downing Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised ""our deep concern at the president's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests"". Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. EU trade chiefs could apply 25% tariffson about $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Brazil, Mexico and Japan have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. The move has also been strongly criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the WTO. Where Trump stands on world trade The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

"The shop and flat above were both destroyed in the blast An explosion that killed five people in Leicester was caused by petrol being spread through a shop, a court has heard.

"Trevor Baylis campaigned to make theft of intellectual property a white-collar crime The inventor of the wind-up radio, Trevor Baylis, has died aged 80, the manager of his company has confirmed. David Bunting said Mr Baylis from Twickenham, south-west London, died on Monday of natural causes after a long illness. Mr Baylis invented the Baygen clockwork radio in 1991. He was appointed CBE in 2015 after campaigning to make theft of intellectual property a white-collar crime. He said chatting with the Queen at the ceremony was""like catching up with an old mate"". Mr Baylis had also worked as a film and TV stuntman and an aquatic showman. He had been seriously debilitated, having suffered from Crohn's disease, Mr Bunting said. Mr Baylis invented the Baygen clockwork radio in 1991 Mr Baylis was previously awarded the OBE for his radio, which he designed after seeing a documentary about Aids in Africa that suggested educational radio programmes could help tackle the spread of the virus. He had said he received almost none of the profits from the invention because people took advantage of patent laws to sell other versions of it. In later life Mr Baylis advised other inventors on developing their ideas, and campaigned against theft of intellectual property. Mr Bunting, who runs Trevor Baylis Brands, said Mr Baylis had no living relatives. Trevor Baylis received his CBE at Windsor Castle in March 2015 Trevor Baylis' wind-up radios could work anywhere. They were sold in the UK, but we weren't the intended market. What made them important was that they were designed for a Third-World application. They were aimed at Africa and places where mains electric power and access to batteries was a problem. The original one had a clockwork-like mechanism with a very ingenious double-spiral spring. It wound off one pulley onto another and would run for relatively short periods of time - about 15 minutes. Later versions lasted longer and were powered by rechargeable batteries. They were charged up with a crankable dynamo or could be plugged into the mains or solar energy panels, if available. Nelson Mandela would say fine things about them, and they won Trevor Baylis various prizes. But while the Baygens certainly sold and were used, their biggest impact was probably that they had been made by a First World engineer who cared about the Third World. There are now all sorts of inventions aimed at the developing world and it's a relatively common thing for young engineers to dedicate themselves to, but that didn't always used to be the case. I think Trevor Baylis deserves considerable credit for having kicked that off and for having served as an inspiration to many other young engineers and inventors.

"The inquiry is looking into abuse in the Diocese of Chichester Senior figures in the Church of England may have conspired to enable the sexual abuse of children, an inquiry has heard. A lawyer representing victims suggested the Church ignored abuse convictions and allowed records to be burnt. The solicitor, David Greenwood, said victims were ""silenced"" by the Church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has begun hearing evidence about how the Anglican Church dealt with complaints over many years. The current phase has begun with an investigation of alleged abuse in the Diocese of Chichester in Sussex. Mr Greenwood told the inquiry: ""We will hear of bishops granting 'Permission to Officiate' certificates to convicted paedophiles and to those facing criminal allegations. ""There is a strong suspicion of an organised conspiracy between clergy and bishops in the Diocese of Chichester to enable children to be abused and it will be painful for all involved to hear."" He added: ""We will hear in this Chichester inquiry of a culture in which burning paper files in the Cathedral yard was tolerated. Bishops ignoring past convictions and allegations was common place."" The inquiry - set up in 2015 - aims to address institutional failures to protect children in England and Wales. Part of a witness statement from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was read to the inquiry by the church's barrister, Nigel Giffin QC. The statement said: ""The failures we have seen are deeply shaming and I personally find them a cause of horror and sadness. ""That children have been abused within the communities of the church is indeed shameful."" Opening the inquiry on Monday, Fiona Scolding QC, the inquiry's counsel, said there was evidence children were made to feel responsible for abuse they suffered. Ms Scolding said there would be evidence from witnesses about a series of potential failings within the Church. She said they included a tendency to ""make children responsible"" for their sexual abuse instead of the adults around them, an inability to spot or even understand so-called ""grooming"" and an inability to understand that victims would suffer from the aftermath of abuse as adults. ""Some of the abuse you will hear about occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, some of it is much more recent,"" said Ms Scolding. ""A series of allegations came to light from the late 1990s onwards and then engulfed the diocese in the first decade of the 21st century."" Ms Scolding also said that, until recently, there had been a culture of amateurism where safeguarding training was patchy and bishops with no management experience were running multi-million pound institutions. The church, she continued, was ""grappling"" with disagreements over sexuality and the role of women. She said: ""What should be unique about the Church is that when faced with abuse within its own ranks, it should act with urgency, compassion, transparency and professionalism. Why was the inquiry into historical child sexual abuse set up? Child abuse inquiry: Boy 'abused' by head of Catholic school By Martin Bashir, BBC Religion Editor Unlike some of the institutions under scrutiny at the inquiry, the church faces some unique challenges not least because it relies upon thousands of unpaid volunteers. There is also the nature of the church, which is designed to be outward facing. In the words of a former Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple: ""The church is the only institution that exists primarily for the benefit of those who are not its members."" How the church expedites its mission of outreach, while ensuring that it is not a safe haven for paedophiles, is perhaps its greatest challenge. ""You will hear evidence that some of those qualities may have been absent in some of the response of the past."" The inquiry will look into the findings of two church-led inquiries which have become the focus of investigations by BBC South East Today. It will also look into the cases of a significant number of Church of England clergy who have been convicted. Their cases have also been repeatedly investigated by the BBC. The Archbishop of Canterbury, meanwhile, has been criticised for seemingly breaching confidentiality surrounding his involvement in the probe. The Most Rev Justin Welby confirmed to journalists that he intended to give evidence and the date of his appearance. All core participants in the inquiry have signed confidentiality agreements, committing not to divulge details including witness timetables, evidence topics and hearing arrangements. Inquiry chairwoman Professor Alexis Jay said: ""The inquiry takes very seriously any breaches of those undertakings or unauthorised sharing of information regarding forthcoming hearings and investigations.""

"This video can not be played Chinook flies in supplies to cut-off Cumbrian communities An RAF Chinook helicopter has flown food and supplies to areas in Cumbria cut off by snow for five days. The aircraft, carrying Royal Marines, took off from Carlisle Airport earlier to aid snowed-in communities around Fellside, South Stainmore and Alston. Supplies included food, fuel, medicines and electrical heating appliances and came as many residents said they were ""burning furniture"" to keep warm. The operation, dubbed Boomster, could continue on Tuesday if required. Soldiers were accompanied by police and mountain rescue personnel. Logs for heating were among supplies dropped off by soldiers near Kirkby Stephen Residents and farmers trapped for five days were happy to see supplies arrive Supplies of food and logs for heating were crammed into the chinook Nenthead, near Alston, is completely cut off by snow Laura Seaton, 38, from the village of Nenthead, near Alston, said: ""We've got a hell of a lot of houses that have been completely and utterly cut off, to the point where they had to be dug out just to get out of their front door, because the drifts that have been up there have been quite incredible. ""There are people who are running out of solid fuel and when that runs out people have been burning their own furniture because the coal merchants down in Alston weren't able to get to the back end of the village. ""It has been pretty horrendous up here."" Mrs Seaton and her husband Jamie, 46, were part of a team of about 40 volunteers who set out to take supplies to people trapped in nearby areas on Sunday after the tough conditions threatened to stop them from stocking up on food and water. WO Roger Atkinson said the those who had been cut off by the snow had been ""bearing up well"" Many homes had been without food and fuel for days A snowblower has been used to clear a road leading to the hamlet of Parkhead near Kirkoswald The Chinook is flying aid to snowed-in communities in Fellside, South Stainmore and Alston Some villages have been cut off for days Natalie Lewis, from Park Head near Lazonby and who had spent 30 hours without electricity, said she was ""relieved"" help had finally arrived. She said: ""The soldiers have been so helpful. They went around and made sure everything was safe."" Warrant Officer Roger Atkinson of the Royal Marines, said: ""Considering what people have been through over the past few days, they have have been bearing up well. ""Our men have just spent two months in Norway doing cold weather warfare training, so we've been very comfortable in this environment. ""We will probably be doing more of the same tomorrow."" County council leader Stewart Young said: ""Despite our very best efforts, and our crews working day and night, we are experiencing ongoing significant challenges in accessing some of our communities. ""The depth of snow and the challenging nature of the terrain is making progress on clearing roads exceptionally slow. ""As a result it is estimated it will be at least 48 hours before we reach many more of these communities, hence the need to bring in military assistance and we are very grateful for their help."" A yellow weather warning for ice issued by the Met Office was in place for areas, including Cumbria, until 11:00 GMT. Wing Commander Gary Lane, RAF Regional Liaison Officer for the North West, said: ""The Chinook helicopter gives the partnership another dimension to be able to deliver vital supplies by air to areas that are cut off by other means.""

"This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" Homes across the UK are facing water supply problems - with thousands of people in Wales and south-east England urged to use as little as possible. Water suppliers say a thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks. About 13,000 homes are still without water in Kent and Sussex while thousands of properties in Wales and 5,000 homes in London also have no supply. The industry regulator Ofwat has said water firms,externalhave ""fallen well short"". Suppliers across the country say teams are working to fix damaged pipes that have left customers with no supply or low pressure. Water companies said cracks and splits had been caused by the freeze which are now being exposed as the pipes thaw. Parts of the Midlands, south-west England and Scotland are also affected. West Midlands-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has agreed to stop production to preserve the water supply for homes, hospitals and schools. Chocolate maker Cadbury also sent workers home from its Bournville plant but said it was able to continue some limited production. In south-east England and Birmingham, suppliers say they have been identifying vulnerable customers and providing them with bottled water. Thames Water have been handing out bottles of water Thames Water said on Monday 10,000 homes in SW16 and NW3 postcodes in London have no water At its peak, more than 20,000 homes in south and north London were left without water on Sunday. Supplier Thames Water said the number of homes affected was constantly falling and was down to about 5,000 by Monday evening. The company said it was taking longer than expected to restore supplies to homes in the SW12, SW15 SW16 and SW17 postcodes. It said households in NW2, NW3, NW5, NW11, N2, N6, N10 and N19 may still be facing low pressure but staff were working in those areas. The company says it distributed almost a million litres of water across the weekend and was continuing to offer to supplies to households in the affected areas of London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that thousands of homes in the capital still lacked water. Several schools in London and Kent were closed on Monday because they were unable to guarantee running water. South East Water set up a number of bottled water stations in Sussex and Kent where 13,000 homes had been affected. Southern Water, which had urged customers to ""only use the water you absolutely must"", said it was restoring the supply to 5,000 homes in Sittingbourne, Kent but there were still 900 homes without water in Hastings and interruptions to supplies in the Crawley area. Severn Trent said it had seen a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes compared with a typical day Work is under way to repair pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw In Wales,about 3,500 customers are without water, Welsh Water said. Thousands of customersare also without water in parts of Birmingham, the West Midlands and Staffordshire. Yorkshire Water, United Utilities, Affinity Water, Anglian Water and Bristol Water also reported problems. Severn Trent, which said it had seen an increase in reports of burst pipes, thanked Coventry-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover for agreeing to stop production ""to help us target our supply"". South West Water said it has an ""unprecedented number of burst water mains"" and warned some customers in Devon and Cornwall that, although water can be used, there is a ""noticeable taste"".

"President Putin met FSB special forces in troubled Chechnya in 2011 FSB. The letters are not just familiar to fans of spy thrillers. They have come to symbolise Vladimir Putin's grip on power in Russia. Russia's secretive security agency has gained notoriety around the world with its intelligence and counter-terror operations. But with roots in the Soviet Union's KGB secret police, allegations of state-sanctioned killings and close ties to the president, it faces questions about its true nature and ambitions. What does the FSB do? The Federal Security Service (FSB) was set up in 1995,external, and is tasked with tackling perceived threats to the Russian state. Mr Putin ran the agency before he came to power. It co-operates with foreign police forces in fighting jihadists and some organised crime gangs. FSBs vehicles near a supermarket following an explosion in St Petersburg in December The FSB poured resources into fighting separatist rebels from Chechnya in two wars, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Russia has tense relations with several of its ex-Soviet neighbours. Part of the FSB's job is to prevent any pro-Western ""colour"" uprisings in Russia like Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution and Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution. In 2015 the FSB was involved in a Cold War-style spy swap with Estonia.A Nato member, Estonia accused Russia of having kidnapped Eston Kohver, the security official exchanged for a jailed Russian spy. In 2002 the assassination of an Arab jihadist commander in Chechnya, known as Khattab, was attributed to the FSB. His Chechen comrades said he had received a letter laced with poison. But the Alexander Litvinenko murder case really put the FSB in the international spotlight. Litvinenko (right) publicly accused fellow FSB officers of corruption in 1998 The ex-FSB officer, bitterly critical of President Putin, was poisoned in London with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006.Litvinenko, given asylum in the UK, had been branded a ""traitor"" in Russia. The official UK inquiry concluded that the killers probably had approval from Mr Putin,externaland the then FSB chief, Nikolai Patrushev. Russia rejected the charges and made the main suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, an MP and national hero. Litvinenko had accused the FSB of running a top-secret hit squad called URPO for assassinating enemies. One of its targets, he said, was the powerful oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who died in the UK years after Litvinenko in 2013 in an apparent suicide. Just weeks before Litvinenko died, Russia passed a law giving the FSB authority to act against ""extremists"" and ""terrorists"" abroad. Is Russia really interfering in European states? Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Russia and the art of 'kompromat' Putin friend in 'money laundering ring' Putin's formative German years Some other prominent opponents of Mr Putin, including journalists, have died mysteriously, fuelling speculation about FSB ""hits"". Often the victims had other enemies, however, who could have targeted them. The FSB can officially warn individuals against ""creating the conditions"" for crimes.Critics see that as a KGB-style power of intimidation, enabling the state to stifle dissent. The TV thriller McMafia links Russian spies to organised crime James Norton stars in McMafia,a TV drama based on Misha Glenny's 2008 non-fiction book exploring global crime networks. In their book on the FSB, called The New Nobility, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan say Mr Putin expanded the FSB's powers by enabling it to send agents abroad for special operations, including intelligence gathering. But Russia's equivalent of the British MI6 - the main overseas spy service - is the External Intelligence Service (SVR). Agents of the military spy service GRU also gather intelligence abroad. The FSB is integral to Russia's new doctrine of information warfare, which includes shaping public opinion abroad via social media. US officials believe the Russian state was linked to hacking and disinformationthat targeted voters in the 2016 US presidential election. In March 2017 US authorities accused two FSB officers - Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin - of hacking Yahoo accounts,externaland stealing the data of millions of users. The FSB has powerful legal tools to monitor internet traffic. A technology called Sorm lets it snoop on emails and phone calls; data has to be kept for 12 hours, by law, for possible inspection;virtual private networks (VPNs) and other anonymisation tools are restricted. The Lubyanka - infamous during the Soviet terror - is now the FSB headquarters Mr Soldatov says Russian telecoms providers have to give the FSB direct access to data. The real scope of FSB surveillance at any one time is not clear. The journalist says that, as with the Communist KGB, the fear of being spied on is a powerful weapon in itself. The headquarters in central Moscow is the Lubyanka - a symbol of FSB power. The KGB interrogated political prisoners there in Soviet times. The FSB's head Alexander Bortnikov reports directly to President Putin. In 2000, Mr Bortnikov's predecessor Nikolai Patrushev called his FSB operatives ""modern nobles"". On becoming president, Mr Putin gave top posts to former spies from St Petersburg. Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a leading Russian sociologist, says that ""we are witnessing a restoration of the power of the KGB"" under Mr Putin. During his first term as president, about one-third of government officials were ""siloviki"" - or ""security guys"", she said. Most of the elite - including Mr Bortnikov - are now subject toEU and/or US sanctions because of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.Most have acquired huge fortunes and control key Russian resources. The FSB's vintage car collection includes a 1922 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost In the 1990s Mr Putin oversaw foreign trade in St Petersburg and some of his associates from that time have been linked to organised crime. Those links are documented by US researcher Karen Dawisha in her book Putin's Kleptocracy. The allegations also surfaced in the Litvinenko inquiry and ina major Spanish police investigation into the Russian mafia. The Spanish prosecutor, Jose Grinda, told US officials that Russia's security services ""control OC (organised crime) in Russia"" and ""the FSB is 'absorbing' the Russian mafia"".,external Reporting by the BBC's Laurence Peter.

"Col Skripal was convicted of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court in August 2006 Sergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was sentenced in 2006 to 13 years in prison, accused of spying for Britain. He was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Russia claimed MI6 had paid him $100,000 for the information, which he had been supplying since the 1990s. But he was one of four prisoners Moscow swapped for spies in the US in 2010. Col Skripal was later flown to the UK. He is now 66. He was found on 4 March slumped on a shopping centre bench in Salisbury, alongside his unconscious 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripal. British experts say a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union was used to poison them. It is in a class of extremely dangerous secret toxins known as Novichok, they say. This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Col Skripal was well regarded during his career in Russia's military intelligence (GRU). A colleague called him ""the life and soul of the party"" and added: ""All his colleagues respected him. So when he was arrested for spying, it was a real shock."" He was arrested near his home in 2004 and convicted two years later of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court. He was stripped of all his titles and awards. Sergei Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 He was alleged by the Russian security service (FSB) to have been recruited by the British secret services in 1995 while serving in the army. He exchanged information classified as Russian state secrets with MI6 for money that was transferred to a Spanish bank account, the FSB claimed. The data on ""several dozen"" Russian undercover operatives, according to pro-Kremlin daily Izvestiya, was eventually used to put FSB agents under surveillance and then expel them from multiple European countries. Even after his retirement in 1999, the FSB claimed Col Skripal continued to pass on state secrets. Col Skripal pleaded guilty at his trial and allegedly confessed while co-operating with investigators, reports said at the time. Russian media gave a lot of air time to Col Skripal's trial and sentencing. They said 13 years was a light sentence considering the ""substantial damage"" he had caused to Russian intelligence services. The daily newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said that in Soviet times he would have been shot. Read more on Col Skripal's intelligence career Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club In July 2010, Col Skripal was pardoned by Russia's then-President Dmitry Medvedev. He was later released together with three other individualsserving time in Russian prisons in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. Among those released by the US was Anna Chapman, who had previously lived in the UK and gained citizenship. Anna Chapman became a presenter on Russian TV Dubbed by the media as ""Russia's most glamorous secret agent"", she went on to present a weekly show on Russian TV. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal was given refuge in the UK, where he kept a low profile for eight years. His wife Liudmila died of cancer in 2012, a year after they had bought a semi-detached home in Salisbury. The Skripals had chosen the Wiltshire city because they believed it to be a good area with a low crime rate, family friends told the BBC. Two years ago, Col Skripal's older brother died in Russia, and last year, his 43-year-old son Alexander died while on holiday with his girlfriend in the Russian city of St Petersburg. He had been rushed to hospital with liver failure. Family members were suspicious at the time. But Alexander's aunt Viktoria says he had a longstanding alcohol problem. She says he took his father's spying conviction very badly and began drinking - a habit that wrecked his first marriage. Col Skripal's family strongly deny that he was an agent of MI6, insisting he was a patriot and that the case against him was fabricated. Col Skripal's mother lives in Yaroslavl, north-east of Moscow, with Viktoria and her family. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight visits the graves of Liudmila Skripal and Alexander Skripal in Salisbury Both Mrs Skripal and Alexander are buried in Salisbury. Yulia was visiting from Moscow. She had increased her visits to her father after her brother's death last July. Father and daughter had visited the two graves before they collapsed. Yulia lived with her parents and brother in Salisbury after 2010 for several years before returning to the Russian capital because she reportedly missed it. A talented linguist, Yulia studied English and geography at a Moscow university. She and her brother were able to travel freely between the UK and Russia, despite their exiled father's situation. Since settling in Salisbury after the spy swap in 2010, Col Skripal appeared to be leading a relaxed and quiet life although he reportedly went on frequent business trips, the BBC's World Affairs Correspondent Richard Galpin said. Col Skripal reportedly kept the company of British intelligence agents and was a member of Salisbury's Railway Social Club. Valery Morozov, another Russian exile living in the UK, said Col Skripal told him he had been doing business, ""working mainly in cyber-security"". Mr Morozov said: ""I understand he was working for some Russian groups."" Col Skripal last called his mother, who is very ill, in mid-February. He reportedly sounded optimistic, though his family say that after the 2010 spy swap, he was always very vigilant because he believed the Russian special services could come after him at any time.

"This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" Homes across the UK are facing water supply problems - with thousands of people in Wales and south-east England urged to use as little as possible. Water suppliers say a thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks. About 13,000 homes are still without water in Kent and Sussex while thousands of properties in Wales and 5,000 homes in London also have no supply. The industry regulator Ofwat has said water firms,externalhave ""fallen well short"". Suppliers across the country say teams are working to fix damaged pipes that have left customers with no supply or low pressure. Water companies said cracks and splits had been caused by the freeze which are now being exposed as the pipes thaw. Parts of the Midlands, south-west England and Scotland are also affected. West Midlands-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has agreed to stop production to preserve the water supply for homes, hospitals and schools. Chocolate maker Cadbury also sent workers home from its Bournville plant but said it was able to continue some limited production. In south-east England and Birmingham, suppliers say they have been identifying vulnerable customers and providing them with bottled water. Thames Water have been handing out bottles of water Thames Water said on Monday 10,000 homes in SW16 and NW3 postcodes in London have no water At its peak, more than 20,000 homes in south and north London were left without water on Sunday. Supplier Thames Water said the number of homes affected was constantly falling and was down to about 5,000 by Monday evening. The company said it was taking longer than expected to restore supplies to homes in the SW12, SW15 SW16 and SW17 postcodes. It said households in NW2, NW3, NW5, NW11, N2, N6, N10 and N19 may still be facing low pressure but staff were working in those areas. The company says it distributed almost a million litres of water across the weekend and was continuing to offer to supplies to households in the affected areas of London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that thousands of homes in the capital still lacked water. Several schools in London and Kent were closed on Monday because they were unable to guarantee running water. South East Water set up a number of bottled water stations in Sussex and Kent where 13,000 homes had been affected. Southern Water, which had urged customers to ""only use the water you absolutely must"", said it was restoring the supply to 5,000 homes in Sittingbourne, Kent but there were still 900 homes without water in Hastings and interruptions to supplies in the Crawley area. Severn Trent said it had seen a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes compared with a typical day Work is under way to repair pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw In Wales,about 3,500 customers are without water, Welsh Water said. Thousands of customersare also without water in parts of Birmingham, the West Midlands and Staffordshire. Yorkshire Water, United Utilities, Affinity Water, Anglian Water and Bristol Water also reported problems. Severn Trent, which said it had seen an increase in reports of burst pipes, thanked Coventry-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover for agreeing to stop production ""to help us target our supply"". South West Water said it has an ""unprecedented number of burst water mains"" and warned some customers in Devon and Cornwall that, although water can be used, there is a ""noticeable taste"".

"This video can not be played Leonne Weeks's killer caught on CCTV A 19-year-old man ""obsessed with murder and killing"" has been jailed for stabbing a 16-year-old girl to death in a ""brutally violent"" attack. Shea Heeley stabbed Leonne Weeks 28 times before hiding her body beneath an abandoned sofa in an alleyway in Dinnington, near Rotherham, in 2017. Sheffield Crown Court heard Heeley later told doctors: ""I like that I've done it. I just do. I like killing."" He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24-and-a-half years. Heeley, of Doe Quarry Lane, Dinnington,pleaded guilty to murder at an earlier hearingat the same court. Leonne Weeks murder: Shea Heeley 'had urge to kill' A psychiatric assessment had concluded Heeley had no diagnosable psychiatric disorders and therefore he was fit to plead. The court heard he had lured Leonne to a secluded alleyway off Lordens Hill on the evening of Sunday 15 January 2017. Leonne Weeks was studying hair and beauty at Dinnington High School Prosecutor Timothy Roberts QC said: ""There in the dark for no reason at all and with a knife that he had taken there for that very purpose, Shea Heeley launched a furious attack upon Leonne, stabbing her no less than 28 times until she was dead. ""He then dragged her lifeless body a short distance and hid it under a discarded, upturned sofa which had been dumped there. ""He walked away and left her there. He must have then disposed of the knife for it has never been discovered."" He said that after the murder Heeley ""invented a story"" and contacted a friend to say that he had been attacked with a knife. He then went to a flat where a group of friends had been babysitting, telling them the same story and saying he needed to wash his hands. Mr Roberts said: ""He was already thinking about how to avoid responsibility for what he had done"". Leonne's body was found on a pathway in Dinnington near Rotherham Later that night he took a group of friends to the alleyway where he killed Leonne claiming that was where he had been attacked. Mr Roberts said Heeley hoped that if anybody had seen him in the alleyway ""he would have two witnesses to say they were with him and he was not with any girl"". The following day, after Leonne's body had been discovered, he told a friend the last time he had seen her was at about 19:00 GMT the night before. He also attempted to cover his tracks by sending a message to Leonne's phone at 20:30 on Sunday asking where she was. The court heard that following his arrest it emerged he had made more than 1,000 internet searches about murder, weapons and serial killers. Mr Roberts said that on 4 January he had searched ""how to get away with murder"" and nine days later for ""how to train myself to be a killer"". He said Heeley had also visited websites about psychopaths and when police searched his home they found a book and DVD about serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. The court heard that while at the police station Heeley told a mental health worker he ""had always known he was going to kill someone from an early age"". He was subsequently assessed by staff at Rampton high security hospital who found no diagnosable mental health disorder, but evidence of an ""emerging personality disorder"". During his time there he confessed the killing to a social worker, saying ""he could hear [Leonne's] screams"" and that ""he had demons inside him"". Jailing Heeley, Judge Paul Watson QC said: ""It is clear that it was always your intention to kill her when the two of you met. ""She had done nothing to offend or upset you and she could in no way have anticipated the terrible and merciless attack to which you subjected her. ""Putting it shortly, you killed her for the sake of it. ""You were obsessed with murder and killing and had told one witness just days before you murdered Leonne that you were a psychopath who wanted to kill people and had no remorse."" In a statement read to the court, Leonne's twin brother Levi said she was a ""beautiful, loving and caring person who would never hurt anyone"". Her father, Darren Weeks, said she was taken away ""by the evil act of a cold-hearted killer"". Her mother, Paula, said: ""I never imagined that when Leonne went out that Sunday evening that I would never see her again.

"This video can not be played Leonne Weeks's killer caught on CCTV A 19-year-old man ""obsessed with murder and killing"" has been jailed for stabbing a 16-year-old girl to death in a ""brutally violent"" attack. Shea Heeley stabbed Leonne Weeks 28 times before hiding her body beneath an abandoned sofa in an alleyway in Dinnington, near Rotherham, in 2017. Sheffield Crown Court heard Heeley later told doctors: ""I like that I've done it. I just do. I like killing."" He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24-and-a-half years. Heeley, of Doe Quarry Lane, Dinnington,pleaded guilty to murder at an earlier hearingat the same court. Leonne Weeks murder: Shea Heeley 'had urge to kill' A psychiatric assessment had concluded Heeley had no diagnosable psychiatric disorders and therefore he was fit to plead. The court heard he had lured Leonne to a secluded alleyway off Lordens Hill on the evening of Sunday 15 January 2017. Leonne Weeks was studying hair and beauty at Dinnington High School Prosecutor Timothy Roberts QC said: ""There in the dark for no reason at all and with a knife that he had taken there for that very purpose, Shea Heeley launched a furious attack upon Leonne, stabbing her no less than 28 times until she was dead. ""He then dragged her lifeless body a short distance and hid it under a discarded, upturned sofa which had been dumped there. ""He walked away and left her there. He must have then disposed of the knife for it has never been discovered."" He said that after the murder Heeley ""invented a story"" and contacted a friend to say that he had been attacked with a knife. He then went to a flat where a group of friends had been babysitting, telling them the same story and saying he needed to wash his hands. Mr Roberts said: ""He was already thinking about how to avoid responsibility for what he had done"". Leonne's body was found on a pathway in Dinnington near Rotherham Later that night he took a group of friends to the alleyway where he killed Leonne claiming that was where he had been attacked. Mr Roberts said Heeley hoped that if anybody had seen him in the alleyway ""he would have two witnesses to say they were with him and he was not with any girl"". The following day, after Leonne's body had been discovered, he told a friend the last time he had seen her was at about 19:00 GMT the night before. He also attempted to cover his tracks by sending a message to Leonne's phone at 20:30 on Sunday asking where she was. The court heard that following his arrest it emerged he had made more than 1,000 internet searches about murder, weapons and serial killers. Mr Roberts said that on 4 January he had searched ""how to get away with murder"" and nine days later for ""how to train myself to be a killer"". He said Heeley had also visited websites about psychopaths and when police searched his home they found a book and DVD about serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. The court heard that while at the police station Heeley told a mental health worker he ""had always known he was going to kill someone from an early age"". He was subsequently assessed by staff at Rampton high security hospital who found no diagnosable mental health disorder, but evidence of an ""emerging personality disorder"". During his time there he confessed the killing to a social worker, saying ""he could hear [Leonne's] screams"" and that ""he had demons inside him"". Jailing Heeley, Judge Paul Watson QC said: ""It is clear that it was always your intention to kill her when the two of you met. ""She had done nothing to offend or upset you and she could in no way have anticipated the terrible and merciless attack to which you subjected her. ""Putting it shortly, you killed her for the sake of it. ""You were obsessed with murder and killing and had told one witness just days before you murdered Leonne that you were a psychopath who wanted to kill people and had no remorse."" In a statement read to the court, Leonne's twin brother Levi said she was a ""beautiful, loving and caring person who would never hurt anyone"". Her father, Darren Weeks, said she was taken away ""by the evil act of a cold-hearted killer"". Her mother, Paula, said: ""I never imagined that when Leonne went out that Sunday evening that I would never see her again. It was a normal day but there had been nothing normal about my life since."" Det Ch Insp Martin Tate said the pair had spent time together before the killing and had mutual friends. ""He has robbed a family of a lifetime with their daughter, and of friends and loved ones of making precious memories together.""

Supplies included food, fuel, medicines and electrical heating appliances and came as many residents said they were ""burning furniture"" to keep warm. The operation, dubbed Boomster, could continue on Tuesday if required. Soldiers were accompanied by police and mountain rescue personnel. Logs for heating were among supplies dropped off by soldiers near Kirkby Stephen Residents and farmers trapped for five days were happy to see supplies arrive Supplies of food and logs for heating were crammed into the chinook Nenthead, near Alston, is completely cut off by snow Laura Seaton, 38, from the village of Nenthead, near Alston, said: ""We've got a hell of a lot of houses that have been completely and utterly cut off, to the point where they had to be dug out just to get out of their front door, because the drifts that have been up there have been quite incredible. ""There are people who are running out of solid fuel and when that runs out people have been burning their own furniture because the coal merchants down in Alston weren't able to get to the back end of the village. ""It has been pretty horrendous up here."" Mrs Seaton and her husband Jamie, 46, were part of a team of about 40 volunteers who set out to take supplies to people trapped in nearby areas on Sunday after the tough conditions threatened to stop them from stocking up on food and water.

""The depth of snow and the challenging nature of the terrain is making progress on clearing roads exceptionally slow.

A yellow weather warning for ice issued by the Met Office was in place for areas, including Cumbria, until 11:00 GMT.

"This video can not be played Theresa May on housing (and Brexit) Young people without family wealth are ""right to be angry"" at not being able to buy a home, Theresa May has said. Announcing reforms to planning rules in England, the PM said home ownership was largely unaffordable to those not backed by ""the bank of mum and dad"". This disparity was entrenching social inequality and ""exacerbating divisions between generations"", she said. Labour said Mrs May, who has housing as a key priority, should be embarrassed by the ""feeble"" measures proposed. Should baby boomers' wealth be more heavily taxed? Your biggest financial decision - in charts Where can I afford to live? Does England need 300,000 new homes a year? ""This housing crisis is made in Downing Street,"" said shadow housing minister John Healey. ""It's time the Tories changed course, and backed Labour's long-term plan to build the genuinely affordable homes."" In her speech to the National Planning Conference. Mrs May said the existingNational Planning Policy Framework will be overhauled,external, pending a consultation, with up to 80 proposals first put forward last year being implemented. The key measures are: 10% of homes on major sites should be available for affordable home ownership Builders to be more open about affordable housing commitments at planning stage Councils will have to adopt a new nationwide standard showing housing need in their areas Infrastructure needs to be considered at pre-planning stage Councils to consider revoking planning permission after two years if building has not started Ancient Woodland and aged trees to get specific protection A separate review, due to be concluded later this year, will look at creating a new automatic right for homeowners to extend upwards and to make it easier to develop agricultural land for housing. Mrs May said the cost of housing, both for ownership and rent, was reinforcing economic divisions and leading to growing social immobility, with public sector workers unable to take jobs in certain parts of the country. This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this ""The result is a vicious circle from which most people can only escape with help from the bank of mum and dad,"" she said. ""Talking to voters during last year's election campaign, it was clear that many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this. ""Angry that, regardless of how hard they work, they won't be able to buy a place of their own. Angry when they're forced to hand more and more of their wages to a landlord to whom their home is simply a business asset. ""They're right to be angry."" Although the number of planning permissions being granted in England has risen since 2010, the PM said this has not been matched by a corresponding rise in the number of homes being built. She pointed the finger of blame partly at developers who she said have a ""perverse"" financial incentive to hoard land once it had been approved for development rather than actually build on it. She criticised bonuses for construction bosses which are ""based not on the number of homes they build but on their profits or share price"". ""In a market where lower supply equals higher prices, that creates a perverse incentive, one that does not encourage them to build the homes we need,"" she said. Labour wants action to address what it says is a 30-year low in home ownership Housing is a big issue and the government clearly knows it. Theresa May admitted that the election campaign had showed her ""many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this."" So who's fault is it that rents are unaffordable, that accommodation is poor, that home ownership for many is completely out of reach? The prime minister pointed the finger at developers who ""game the system"". Her housing secretary blamed councils for ""nimbyist attitudes"". But both said, too, that there was no ""silver bullet"". When voters get angry though, they will look for someone to blame. Which is why the government is at pains to show it is taking the housing problem seriously. It may take more than a reminder of promises already made and an overhaul of planning guidelines to convince people of that. So expect to see Theresa May in a high visibility vest again before long. There was an outcry last year after Persimmon announced that 140 staff would share a bonus pool of Â£500m and that its chief executive was in line for a payout of Â£110m, a figure that has since been reduced by Â£25m. While the firm defended the payouts, saying they were a reward for success, critics say the tripling of the firm's share price since 2013 was in part due to government subsidies for new homes via the Help to Buy Scheme. Why can't the UK build 240,000 houses a year? ""I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise,"" she said. ""I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs."" Mrs May insisted that ""tearing up"" the Green Belt was not the answer to the UK's housing crisis and that existing protections would be maintained and, in some cases, strengthened. This video can not be played Nick Boles set out what he thought Theresa May's housing speech was lacking Councils will only be able to amend Green Belt boundaries if they can prove they have fully explored every other reasonable option for building the homes their community needs. The Local Government Association said it was wrong to blame councils as they were approving nine out of ten proposed developments and yet more than 420,000 homes with permission were still waiting to be built. ""No-one can live in a planning permission,"" said its chair Lord Porter. ""Developers need to get on with building affordable homes with the needed infrastructure and councils need greater powers to act where housebuilding has stalled."" This video can not be played CPRE suggests building more new homes in northern England The Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said the PM was only ""tinkering at the edges"" of what was needed to boost the supply of new homes and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the ""speech overlooked entirely the role central government must play... private developers and local authorities cannot do this alone"". Housing charity Shelter said Mrs May was right to close ""loopholes"" being used by developers to reduce affordable housing levels. The Resolution Foundation welcomed the call for local government and housebuilding firms to do more, but also said the government needed to do more and said it was now ""time for action, not just discussion"" on private renting In her speech the PM also said homelessness was a ""source of national shame"" and Â£1bn was being spent to halve rough sleeping. Housing policy is devolved in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish government has pledged to build 50,000 new affordable homes by 2021 whilethe Welsh government launched two schemeslast week designed to help more people onto the housing ladder.

"This video can not be played Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade Levi jeans and bourbon could be hit with a 25% import tax by the European Union if President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade, told the BBC the items were on a draft list of US goods to be taxed. Last week, the President said he would tax imported steel, declaring: ""trade wars are good"". His comments have prompted reaction around the world. Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her concern in a telephone call to Mr Trump on Sunday. Levi Strauss came out strongly against trade barriers. A company spokesperson told the BBC: ""We support open markets and free trade where everyone plays by the rules. Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer."" Kamal Ahmed: Why Trump is playing tough on trade Ms MalmstrÃ¶m told the BBC: ""We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union."" She said they would wait for the final decision, but added that ""we are of course preparing. This has been in the air for some time"". She said that if the US went ahead and applied taxes to European steel, the EU would take the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ms MalmstrÃ¶m stressed that Europe was looking to respond ""to retaliate but not escalate"". But any action by Europe is likely to provoke further action by the US. Shares in major European car makers fell on Monday following a threat by US President Trump to tax their vehicles. Mr Trump said if the EU ""wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies... we will simply apply a tax on their cars"". The US is an important market for cars built in the country. US demand for British-built cars rose by 7% in 2017, with exports reaching almost 210,000, and the US is now the UK's second-largest trading partner after the EU, taking 15.7% of car exports. Why Trump is hanging tough on trade What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Downing Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised ""our deep concern at the President's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests."" Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". EU trade chiefs could apply 25% tariffson around $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whiskey. Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. The move has also been strongly criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the WTO. Where Trump stands on world trade A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay. Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, told the BBC the proposed tariffs were ""a very costly and inefficient way to help a small number of people"". He says consumers are likely to face higher prices. ""This could be bad or awful, there's no scenario under which it's good."" Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Trade Partnership, a Washington-based economics and consulting firm,released an analysis,externalpredicting that the tariffs would lead to net loss of about 146,000 jobs in the US, or more than five for every one gained. President Trump hinted on Monday that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the latest North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for a tariff on Canada's and Mexico's steel imports.

The rest of the tweet is a reference to Canada and US farmers. All three major US stock indexes - the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq - rose by 1% or more on Monday, as investors interpreted Mr Trump's comments as a sign that his plan for tariffs remains up for debate. Substantial changes to the Nafta agreement are not likely to happen soon, however. The current round of Nafta talks, about updating the 24-year old treaty, finished on Monday with little progress. This is the seventh round of eight scheduled meetings. The next is planned for April. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

"One gown is never enough at the Academy Awards, especially for those stars who followed the ceremony with a visit to Vanity Fair's post-awards shindig. Here are the contrasting looks chosen by seven A-listers on Sunday - plus one who managed to find three dresses for the occasion. Shape of Water and McDormand rule Oscars Four key themes from this year's Oscars Why's everyone talking about this outfit? Oscars 2018 pictures: Red carpet glamour Britain'sEmily Bluntwas demureness personified at the ceremony in a powder blue gown with a high collar, puffy sleeves and a regal train. By the time she rocked up at the Vanity Fair party, though, she'd traded it for a figure-hugging gold number with floral and avian detailing. The sequins and tassles of her Givenchy gown ensured Wonder Woman starGal Gadotsparkled on the red carpet. Her post-show frock also twinkled, though this one came with a daring thigh slash and an ever more plunging neckline. Salma Hayekmade a bold statement at the ceremony with a tiered purple gown topped with elaborate crystal chain mail. The eccentricity continued afterwards with a pink Gucci gown customised by Harlem designer Dapper Dan. Best supporting actress winnerAllison Janneyrocked it in red in a Reem Acra gown with carpet-caressing angel sleeves. The I, Tonya star remained a scarlet woman at the Vanity Fair party... from the waist down at least. Margot Robbielooked ready to walk down the aisle in a Chanel Haute Couture gownshe reportedly mended herself,externalwhen one of its arm straps broke. That got traded at the Vanity Fair event for an intricately detailed ivory number with a sheer overlay, topped off by a sparkly globe-shaped purse. Emma Stone, last year's best actress winner, returned to the Oscars in a silk Louis Vuitton blazer adorned with a bright pink sash. A few hours later, she reappeared in a yellow and grey mini-dress. Zendaya, star of The Greatest Showman, seemed to have a circus tent in mind with this off-the-shoulder chocolate creation. The fishtail gown she wore at the Vanity Fair event was considerably more flattering to the 21-year-old's figure. Finally, here's Grammy-winning singer turned Oscar-nominated actressMary J Bligeshowing us how it's done in shimmering white, voluptuous red and glorious gold.

""This is about paying it forward to the young people who might not believe they can achieve the highest honour in whatever craft they want to push for."" He also suggested that Hollywood was experiencing ""a renaissance"", adding: ""I feel proud to be at the beginning of a movement where I feel like the best films in every genre are being brought to me by my fellow black directors.""

"This video can not be played ""At least I got a goody bag"": Jack Gray talks to the BBC A man who ran his first half marathon, and won, was disqualified for running under his boss's name, having taken his place three days earlier. Jack Gray, 24, ran the Cambridge Half Marathon on Sunday when his boss Andrew Rawlings was injured. He said he tried to contact the organisers and did not get a reply, but confessed after crossing the line in first place. Sheffield student William Mycroft, who came second, was declared the winner. WATCH: Burger-flipping robot starts first shift Public anger over housing justified - PM WATCH: Prostate cancer symptoms explained More than 7,000 runners took part in the event. Mr Gray, who usually runs in 5km races, said: ""My boss called on Thursday to ask if I wanted to take his place as he was injured, and I thought 'why not?' Jack Gray (circled in red), won the race but was disqualified, and Will Mycroft (in green) was declared the winner Jack Gray said he knew of others who had swapped places, but thinks he was singled out because he won ""I thought it would be a shame for the place to go to waste and I made a donation to charity as I was now going to take part."" As he crossed the finish line in 66 minutes and 52 seconds, he heard the name ""Andrew Rawlings"" ringing out over the public address system. ""It dawned on me I might have a bit of explaining to do,"" he said. ""People were lining up to interview me, so I thought I'd better 'fess up straight away, and told the organisers I wasn't Andrew."" He was disqualified for running under the wrong name, but said he was ""happy"" when his Cambridge & Coleridge Athletic Club colleague was declared the winner with a time of 67 minutes and 11 seconds. Mr Mycroft, who grew up in Cambridgeshire, referred to himself as ""just the technical winner"". ""It's a bit of a shame to win on a technicality, but I'm not going to complain.""

Delays were reported in the central belt on Tuesday morning, including routes around Edinburgh, the M77 and the M80. Met Office yellow warnings for snow and ice,externalremain in place for large parts of the country until 21:00 on Tuesday. Some rural communities are still cut off, including in the Carron Valley area in Stirlingshire. Gritters were sent to the M77 near Newton Mearns, where heavy snowfall caused problems for HGVs and brought traffic to a standstill for most of the morning. Heavy snow also caused very slow traffic on the M80 at Old Inns, and at Denny in Stirlingshire, while the weather also caused congestion on the Edinburgh-bound A70.

The return of wintry weather came as the country was largely returning to normal after ""the Beast from the East"". The freezing conditions paralysed much of the travel network across central Scotland, causing the temporary shut down of many businesses from Wednesday afternoon into Thursday as people were advised not to drive in heavy snow. Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Trades Union Congress have now agreed to draw up a severe weather charter for employers, to make clear how staff should be treated when a weather alert is issued. It follows reports that workers were put under unreasonable pressure to get to work, or kept from going home when the severe weather hit. Most schools reopened on Monday after three days of closure, but Midlothian and South Lanarkshire councils said on Tuesday that schools would open later than usual to allow more travel time in the snow. Midlothian Council tweeted: ""Alert - due to snow this morning pupils should not attend for school until 11am, if possible, this morning (Tuesday). However, if already on your way, don't worry, there will be staff present."" Scottish Borders Council said that the conditions had proved a challenge for school buses in their area, although the local authority said schools were open. Fresh snowfall on Tuesday made for difficult driving conditions on the A702 Efforts are continuing to clear a road in the Carron Valley to allow food and medical supplies to be brought in after up to 30 people were trapped by snow for six days. Stuart Ballantyne from Trossachs Search and Rescue told BBC Scotland on Monday: ""We could only get about a mile from the closest house because the snow was about five or six feet deep. A digger has been clearing the road to reach a cut-off community in the Carron Valley area Rescuers walked for two hours in thick fog to reach the stranded residents ""The diggers are working hard, they're working furiously, but our members have had to climb on top of that snow and then walk in, and there's fog as well, so they had to navigate across where they believed the road was towards several houses."" Stevie Coombes, a rescue volunteer who reached the residents after a two -hour trek through the snow, told BBC Scotland: ""They were just happy to see us and happy to get some supplies. ""One farmer made us a flask of Bovril which was nice. They are all in pretty good spirits."" Resident Norman Lynch said: ""We have quite a thick fog here as well. Visibility is quite low. ""We are not able to get out with any vehicles - the road is totally impassable. ""We've personally been stuck for six days. That's the last time we could use the road with a 4x4."" A number of low level flood alerts are in place for Edinburgh, the Lothians, the Borders, Fife, Dundee, Angus, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. The Scottish government said people could still expect to face ""challenging"" conditions in some areas. Farmers such as Peter Laidlaw from Craigannet Farm in the Carron Valley have been out feeding livestock The Carron Valley Fishery was one of many businesses affected ScotRail has said the rail network was back to running a ""near-normal"" service. Community warned about water supply Employers warned over snow days pay dock Economic impact may not be as bad a feared Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ""Conditions have improved significantly in many parts of the country but I would urge the Scottish public to remain vigilant. ""Armies"" of local people helped clear roads across Scotland, including in the village of Blanefield ""Yellow (be aware) weather warnings are still in place across all but the most westerly parts of Scotland, and in most parts ice and surface water will create challenges for drivers on some minor roads. ""The advice from Police Scotland is travel with caution in all areas, and drivers are encouraged to plan ahead and check weather forecasts.""

"Parents helped to clear snow to allow Creigiau primary school, near Cardiff, to reopen on Monday About 3,000 properties are without water because of burst pipes as snow and ice begins to melt. Welsh Water is dealing with 200 incidents and warned of further possible problems as temperatures rise. Gwynedd, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire are still affected, with people in the latter countyleft waiting for a repeatedly-delayed delivery of bottled water,external. Most schools have reopened, but snow and ice meant more than 100 were shut. Welsh Water said people may see discoloured water as supplies came back and it hoped to have everyone reconnected by Tuesday afternoon. This video can not be played Why do water main pipes burst? However, people in some parts of Pembrokeshire will not be able to get bottled water delivered until at least Tuesday. It was originally planned that a Welsh Water delivery for Simpson Cross, St Davids, Roch, Croesgoch, Trefin and Porthgain would happen on Monday evening. But Pembrokeshire council saidthe delivery would not arrive at its depot until midnight,external, meaning the water would not be dropped of until 08:00.

Debbie Wilcox, Welsh Local Government Association leader, said councils were ""faced with significant additional costs incurred over the last few days and in coming weeks which will be an extra pressure on already tight budgets"". Welsh Water said it was prioritising vulnerable people who were without water and opening bottled water stations to help those who were cut off. Managing director Peter Perry told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme: ""We'd normally see around 75 bursts or leaks on our system every day. We're currently dealing with 200."" He said problems were caused by older, cast iron pipes being damaged by ground movement caused by the cold weather. Mr Perry urged customers not to leave taps running unnecessarily because supplies were low due to a surge in demand in the past few days. People had to queue for bottled water from Welsh Water in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd Dee Valley Water also called on customers to report leaks caused by frozen pipes thawing so it could locate them quickly and repair them. Darrin Pascoe, from Blaenwaun, near Whitland, Carmarthenshire, said he had been without running water since Thursday and had been filling up bottles from a neighbour's tap. ""I cannot wash or wash clothes or dishes. I cannot clean the kitchen,"" he said. Ian Cole, 68, said he had to ""surf"" through the snow to reach his church on Sunday Meanwhile, Ian Cole, 68, said his home in Llanstephan near Builth Wells, Powys, was still cut off on Monday, due to ""shoulder-height"" snow drifts. He claimed Powys council is yet to grit the area to allow cars to pass and he was running out of medication. ""In some places the drifts are shoulder-height, we personally are cut off,"" he said. Ysgol Ardudwy in Harlech, Gwynedd, will be closed for the rest of the week after the storm caused significant damage to the roof Most schools reopened, although more than 114 remained closed on Monday, mainly in Caerphilly, Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen. The majority plan to reopen on Tuesday, with just tens of schools to stay closed, mostly in Blaenau Gwent. Arriva Trains Wales,externalsaid it planned to run a full service on the majority of its network on Monday, although no trains will run on the Heart of Wales or Blaenau Ffestiniog lines. It said the Heart of Wales line would stay closed on Tuesday. ""We would like to thank our customers for their continued patience over the past four days of disruption and our railway teams, who have been working tirelessly in very challenging weather conditions,"" a spokesman said.

"This video can not be played Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton on The Silent Child Oscars win A film starring a six-year-old deaf British girl and made by two former Hollyoaks stars has won an Oscar. The Silent Child, which tells the story of a girl who struggles to communicate, was named best live action short film. It stars Maisie Sly, aged six, from Swindon, and Rachel Shenton, who played Mitzeee Minniver in the Channel 4 soap. Shenton also wrote it and used sign language in her acceptance speech. It was directed by Chris Overton - AKA Hollyoaks cage fighter Liam McAllister. The Oscars ceremony as it happened The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand rule the Oscars In pictures: Red carpet glamour Watch highlights from the Oscars red carpet ""I made a promise to our six-year-old lead actress that I would sign this speech,"" Shenton said while accepting the statuette at Sunday's ceremony in Hollywood. ""My hands are shaking a little bit so I apologise,"" she added. This video can not be played Oscars 2018: Shenton promised to sign her speech Maisie didn't go up on stage to collect the award, but Overton told BBC 5 live: ""When we won I could see her up there jumping up and down and that was surreal. Maisie Sly walked the red carpet with Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton ""But I think she's taken it all in her stride. She always said we'd win."" Shenton added: ""She held the Oscar, she said it was very heavy, she had her photograph taken with it and then said she wanted to go back and see her brothers and sisters, so she's keeping it real."" One mother, two school shootings Employers warned over snow days pay dock Trump threatens tax on EU cars The Silent Child tells the story of a profoundly deaf four-year-old called Libby, played by Maisie. She lives a silent life until a social worker, played by Shenton, teaches her how to communicate through sign language. This video can not be played Maisie is taking Hollywood life in her stride. Giving her acceptance speech complete with sign language, Shenton said: ""Our movie is about a deaf child being born into a world of silence. It's not exaggerated or sensationalised for the movie. ""This is happening. Millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers, and particularly access to education. ""Deafness is a silent disability. You can't see it and it's not life threatening so I want to say the biggest of thank yous to the Academy for allowing us to put this in front of a mainstream audience."" Overton and Shenton are engaged Shenton, from Stoke-on-Trent, was inspired to write the film by her father, who went deaf after receiving treatment for chemotherapy when she was 12. She became a qualified British Sign Language Interpreter and ambassador for the National Deaf Children's Society. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his acceptance speech, Overton thanked Shenton - his fiancee. He said: ""It's really your hard work for the last 12 years that has really made this project authentic."" Overton also thanked their parents for making cup cakes to raise funds for the film, and those who backed its crowdfunding campaign. He told BBC Breakfast they raised ""over Â£1,000 in cupcakes"". ""My mum and dad made the cupcakes and Rachel's mum and her mum's partner Nigel sold them at their work,"" he said. ""We crowdfunded this all by ourselves and we had the support of so many people, but it was made on a shoestring."" The pair cast Maisie, who had never acted before, after a nationwide search involved advertising on the websites of deaf organisations. They auditioned 100 children before they found their star. Maisie's family had recently relocated 160 miles from Plymouth to Swindon so Maisie could attend a mainstream school where deaf children are supported.

"One director, two Oscars: Guillermo del Toro at the Academy Awards This year's Oscar ceremony won't go down in history as one of the most surprising ever - perhaps a good thing after last year'sbest picture mix-up. Most of the people who were expected to win awards won them, while the awards were evenly distributed between the main films in contention. And despite references to#MeTooandHarvey Weinstein, it didn't feel as political as the Golden Globes with itsred carpet black-out. Yet there were themes that ran through the ceremony, repeated by different winners in different categories. Here are the four main threads: Oscars 2018: Full coverage,external Awards for the worst jokes, the best trivia and erm... Emma Stone So what actually is an inclusion rider? Some people get Oscars for their first film. But for some, it takes longer - quite a bit longer, in fact. On Sunday we saw James Ivory win his very first Oscar, for adapted screenplay, for the gorgeous yet heartbreaking coming-of-age romance Call Me By Your Name. James Ivory's previous Oscar nominations had all been for directing At 89, he's the oldest person to ever take home one of the coveted gold statues - and it sounds like it was worth the wait. He told the press room: ""I mean, being 90 years for anything that you would do is extraordinary. ""But to be here having won the Oscar at that age, this seems like a hiccup in nature. But it feels great."" Then we had British cinematographer Roger Deakins, finally winning an Oscar after being nominated a stonking 14 times. In the end, it was his work on Blade Runner 2049 that earned him the award. Allison Janney cut an elegant figure as she posed with her Oscar backstage It was actually Allison Janney's first Oscars, and her first win - something she once thought was simply not going to happen for her. ""I didn't dare to dream of things like this, because I didn't want to be disappointed,"" she said. ""At a certain point, I'd given up on something like this happening to me."" And while Jordan Peele won the Oscar for best original screenplay for Get Out, he had quit writing it 20 times.Yes, 20 times. But he persevered. The message there? Don't give up and dare to dream. This year's Oscars may have been devoid of the drama that categorised last year - possibly thanks to a larger font being used on the envelopes. Neither was it a politically-charged year for the Academy Awards, with no#OscarsSoWhitethis time around. But it did feel like there was a change in the air: a sense of new kinds of films being recognised, made by people who might have previously been passed over by the Oscars. That's quite likely due to the change in the make-up of the voting Academy in recent years. Jordan Peele put it well by saying there was a ""renaissance"" in film. Gary Oldman had encouraging words for Timothee Chalamet - 37 years his junior It was like a baton was being passed too, when Gary Oldman paid tribute to the skills of fellow best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet - telling the young actor he'd be back and that his time for an Oscar would come. Meanwhile, The Shape of Water director Guillermo del Toro offered a challenge to aspiring film-makers. ""I want to tell you - everyone who is dreaming ofâ¦ using genre or fantasy to tell stories about the things that are real in the world today, you can do it,"" he said as he picked up the award for best picture. ""This is a door - kick it open and come in."" That line came from the inspiring speech given by Lee Unkrich, producer of Disney/Pixar's charming Day of the Dead animation Coco. He said his biggest thanks went to Mexico, and that the film could not have existed without its ""endlessly beautiful culture and traditions"". Director Lee Unkrich (right) with the Coco crew ""With Coco, we tried to take a step forward toward a world where all children can grow up seeing characters in movies that look and talk and live like they do,"" he told the audience. ""Marginalised people deserve to feel like they belong. Representation matters."" It was an Oscars where representation seemed to matter, more than perhaps ever before. It was on stage in the form of Daniela Vega, the first transgender actress to present. (The film she stars in, A Fantastic Woman, also won best foreign film.) And it was present when del Toro won best director and best picture. Daniela Vega made history when she came on stage to introduce a song performance Frances McDormand made a point of forcing the Oscars to stare representation in the face by asking female nominees to stand up. And Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton spoke of the importance of their short film, The Silent Child, in representing deafness. There's still a long way to go, with only one woman having won a best director Oscar - an award that's yet to go to a black director. But it feels like a start. It might seem like the stuff of dreams - or of nightmares, depending on how you feel about hot dogs. But giant plastic hot dog cannons that you fire actual hot dogs out of are real, they exist, and they formed a key part of a skit during the Oscars show. Jimmy Kimmel got celebrities including Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie and Emily Blunt to take a quick trip across the road to a nearby cinema, where an unsuspecting audience were watching a preview of A Wrinkle in Time. Ansel Elgort - minus hot dog cannon - made an energetic entrance There they provided snacks to the surprised members of the public. But the highlight was surely Armie Hammer and Ansel Elgort armed with hot dog cannons. ""This is better than the Oscars!"" Gadot exclaimed. In addition to being showered with hot dogs, host Jimmy Kimmel surprised the audience at the Dolby Theatre with snack boxes full of crisps, Gummy bears, chocolate, granola bars and - thoughtfully - Listerine strips. ""It wouldn't be right to make you sit through this without snacks,"" a note inside the boxes read, adding: ""Please don't throw them at me."" Allow Twitter content?

"Retailers will ban the sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre Sales of energy drinks to children under 16 have been banned in most major UK supermarkets, amid concerns about high levels of sugar and caffeine. Boots is also joining supermarkets such as Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op in introducing the rule. Retailers will limit sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to under-16s. Co-op said it recognised the ""growing concern about the consumption of energy drinks"" among children. The handbag that costs as much as a house Conman returns with scam targeting actors A routine abduction - of a 13-year-old girl Other supermarkets introducing the voluntary ban include Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Boots is the first retailer to partake that is not a supermarket. The Co-op, Aldi and Lidl implemented the change on 1 March, while Morrisons, Waitrose, Asda and Boots put the rule in place on 5 March. A Boots spokesperson said: ""Helping our customers to live healthier lives has always been our core purpose. ""We have listened to the growing public concern about young people consuming these high sugar and highly-caffeinated drinks."" Although Tesco has announced its decision to follow, it will not implement the change until 26 March. The move follows calls by campaigners for a complete ban on energy drinks, and after MP Maria Caulfield asked Prime Minister Theresa May toconsider a UK-wide banearlier this year.

"Among the delegates meeting Kim Jong-un was Chung Eui-yong, head of Seoul's presidential National Security Office North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hosted a dinner for senior South Korean delegates - the first time officials from Seoul have met the young leader since he took office in 2011. The South Korean president's office confirmed the meeting shortly after the delegates' arrival on Monday. The 10-member team is in Pyongyang for talks partly aimed at restarting dialogue between the North and the US. Relations between the Koreas have warmed following last month's Olympics. In an unprecedented move, the South Korean delegation includes two ministerial-level envoys - intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security adviser Chung Eui-yong. North Korean state radio earlier said the delegation was met at the airport by Ri Son-gwon, North Korea's reunification chief, who led talks in the weeks before the Winter Olympics. During the two-day visit, the South Korean group will focus on establishing conditions for talks aimed at getting rid of the North's nuclear weapons as well as dialogue between the US and Pyongyang. Mr Chung had earlier told a press briefing he would deliver President Moon Jae-in's ""resolution to maintain the dialogue and improvement in relations between the South and the North... [and] to denuclearize the Korean peninsula"". ""I plan to hold in-depth discussions on various ways to continue talks between not only the South and the North, but also the North and the United States,"" he added. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the US would be prepared to meet North Korea, but reiterated that Pyongyang would first have to ""denuke"". However, North Korea - which has said it wants to talk to the US - said it was ""preposterous"" for the US to insist on preconditions. ""The US attitude shown after we clarified our intention for dialogue compels us to only think that the US is not interested in resuming... dialogue,"" said the foreign ministry in a statement reported by state media. It remains unclear who would represent the US in any such meeting. Winter Olympics: Is window for US-North Korea peace closing? North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' By Laura Bicker, BBC Seoul Correspondent The South Korean team (left) met North Korean officials, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (not shown here) later hosted a dinner Kim Jong-un meeting South Korean ministers face to face for the first time is a pretty big deal. He has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011, and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. But the young North Korean leader appears to be turning on the charm, again - treating the South Koreans to a banquet. However, the after-dinner conversation could be awkward. South Korea really needs Pyongyang and Washington to talk to one another. The problem is the two sides have different terms when it comes to even starting those discussions. President Trump has said Kim Jong-un must be willing to ""denuke"". North Korea has rejected this precondition, and has some of its own - especially over joint US-South Korea military drills, due to resume in April. It's going to take some deft diplomatic skills over dinner to try to get these two sides together before those exercises begin. The top US diplomat on North Korea Joseph Yun announced his decision to retire earlier last week, a departure which could hamper the Trump administration. Analysts believe that Mr Yun was very much in favour of compromise and diplomacy with North Korea. Joseph Yun leaves his post as a US special representative for North Korea policy without a successor The relationship between the US and North Korea was particularly tense before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, with both countries repeatedly threatening each other with total destruction. But the Games saw the two Koreas march together under a single flag - the outcome of the first inter-Korean talks in two years. The question now being asked is whetherNorth Korea's participation in the Paralympics, starting this week, can lead to an even bigger breakthrough. The US has distanced itself from the North Korean overtures during the Games. US Vice-President Mike Pence has said there is ""no daylight"" between the US and its regional allies on the need to ""continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programme. North Korea has also issued a warning about the scheduled US-South Korea military drills, which it views as a provocation. The next set of exercises is due to begin in April. A report last week in the ruling party's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the military exercises ""cannot be tolerated under any circumstances"". ""Their (intention) is to blow away the atmosphere of improved North-South relations... this should be regarded as outrageously insane behaviour by confrontation fanatics who are anxious to bring about disaster,"" the report read.

"Roger Deakins said his win was all about ""doing the job you love and enjoying your life"" It's been a long time coming but finally on his 14th nomination, legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins has won his first Academy Award. In a career spanning more than 40 years, he's worked on notable films such as The Shawshank Redemption, Fargo and Skyfall. His victory came for Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049, a return to Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi world. Accepting his Oscar, Deakins said: ""I really love my job."" He graciously continued: ""One of the reasons I really love it is because of the people I work with in front of and behind the camera."" He saw off competition from Dunkirk's Hoyte van Hoytema, Darkest Hour's Bruno Delbonnel, and Mudbound's Rachel Morrison, the first woman cinematographer to be nominated. Deakins' first nomination was in 1994 for The Shawshank Redemption. Blade Runner 2049: The film that clinched Roger Deakins' win He's probably best known though for his work with the Coen brothers, having shot 11 of their films, including No Country for Old Men and O Brother, Where Art Though? He's also also formed partnerships with Sam Mendes and Villeneuve, with whom he has made three movies. Before this year's ceremony, there was media speculation as to why Deakins had not been honoured with a statuette. Variety's opinion,externalwas ""part of the problem is that so many of Deakins' nominations have come for films that weren't widely embraced by the Academy"". ""It's rare for the cinematography prize to go to a film not nominated for best picture."" Deakins himself modestly maintained he wasn't that bothered by the lack of recognition,telling the Los Angeles Times,external: ""I'm just proud to still be doing the job, really, and happy doing it."" Outside the post-Oscars ceremony star-studded Vanity Fair party, BBC correspondent Rebecca Jones caught up with the cinematographer. Asking him how he felt about his long-awaited victory, Deakins said: ""This night is about the celebration of movies. It's not about winning or losing."" Awards for the worst jokes, the best trivia and Emma Stone So what actually is an inclusion rider? Why is everyone talking about this outfit? He added he hadn't really thought about his lack of previous Oscar success: ""I was just too busy working. Time passes and one day you wake up and think, 'Oh, it's been 23 years'."" And his win this time was just a mark of the fact he ""was just here doing it, doing the job you love and enjoying your life"". Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya - who lost out to Gary Oldman in the best actor category - was beside Deakins. He said of Deakins' win, he was happy for ""good people, who just do the work, to be recognised, to be put on a platform and be told, 'well done' for the work that you've done"". ""For me, it fills me with joy to see that happen for Roger. ""It's human to want to be recognised."" And there was effusive reaction to Deakins' success on Twitter. Prominent celebrity and fashion magazine Vanity Fair said Deakins' win was the night's ""most deserving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Sinn FÃ©in shared a meeting of minds at talks with the EU's chief negotiator on Monday, the party said. Party President Mary Lou McDonald made the comments after she and her party colleagues met Michel Barnier in Brussels. It follows comments from Prime Minister Theresa May that she did not want to see a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Ms McDonald said the issue was now ""in Mrs May's court"". Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan May urges EU to embrace 'ambitious' Brexit Reality Check: What does the EU Brexit draft reveal? Johnson says NI border row being exploited She said the British government had to come up with Plan A and Plan B, and there could be be no overall agreement on Brexit unless the issue of the border was solved. The Sinn FÃ©in leader said her party was ""not looking for a border down the Irish Sea"". She said there was now a challenge for Mr Barnier to ""hold steady"", but that ""he gets it"" on the issue of Brexit and the border. Mrs May has also said she did not want a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister was responding to a legal text published by the EU as part of the Brexit negotiations with the UK. The EU's draft legal agreement proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Mr Barnier hosted a Sinn FÃ©in delegation including party president Mary Lou McDonald, vice president Michelle O'Neill and MEPs Martina Anderson and Matt Carthy. Sinn FÃ©in is keen to stress that there should be a special status for Northern Ireland. The party wants to know how Brexit will affect cross-border workers and will insist that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement must be protected. The Sinn FÃ©in president believes the only way to avoid a hard border is for Northern Ireland to remain within the customs union and single market. Mary Lou McDonald has said a hard border can only be avoided if NI stays within the customs union and single market The Irish border question is at the heart of EU-UK discussions and although a number of options have been tabled, there is no agreed plan of what life will look like after Brexit. Mr Barnier set up the series of meetings this week with Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to gauge opinion. On Tuesday, he will get a very different perspective when he hosts the DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds in Brussels. The DUP opposes special status for Northern Ireland and are against staying in the customs union or single market. The party insists that recent EU proposals would break up the UK. Nigel Dodds has said an internal border would be ""catastrophic"" for Northern Ireland to be ""cut off"" from UK. Last week, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK. Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short.""

"This video can not be played Leonne Weeks's killer caught on CCTV A 19-year-old man ""obsessed with murder and killing"" has been jailed for stabbing a 16-year-old girl to death in a ""brutally violent"" attack. Shea Heeley stabbed Leonne Weeks 28 times before hiding her body beneath an abandoned sofa in an alleyway in Dinnington, near Rotherham, in 2017. Sheffield Crown Court heard Heeley later told doctors: ""I like that I've done it. I just do. I like killing."" He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24-and-a-half years. Heeley, of Doe Quarry Lane, Dinnington,pleaded guilty to murder at an earlier hearingat the same court. Leonne Weeks murder: Shea Heeley 'had urge to kill' A psychiatric assessment had concluded Heeley had no diagnosable psychiatric disorders and therefore he was fit to plead. The court heard he had lured Leonne to a secluded alleyway off Lordens Hill on the evening of Sunday 15 January 2017. Leonne Weeks was studying hair and beauty at Dinnington High School Prosecutor Timothy Roberts QC said: ""There in the dark for no reason at all and with a knife that he had taken there for that very purpose, Shea Heeley launched a furious attack upon Leonne, stabbing her no less than 28 times until she was dead. ""He then dragged her lifeless body a short distance and hid it under a discarded, upturned sofa which had been dumped there. ""He walked away and left her there. He must have then disposed of the knife for it has never been discovered."" He said that after the murder Heeley ""invented a story"" and contacted a friend to say that he had been attacked with a knife. He then went to a flat where a group of friends had been babysitting, telling them the same story and saying he needed to wash his hands. Mr Roberts said: ""He was already thinking about how to avoid responsibility for what he had done"". Leonne's body was found on a pathway in Dinnington near Rotherham Later that night he took a group of friends to the alleyway where he killed Leonne claiming that was where he had been attacked. Mr Roberts said Heeley hoped that if anybody had seen him in the alleyway ""he would have two witnesses to say they were with him and he was not with any girl"". The following day, after Leonne's body had been discovered, he told a friend the last time he had seen her was at about 19:00 GMT the night before. He also attempted to cover his tracks by sending a message to Leonne's phone at 20:30 on Sunday asking where she was. The court heard that following his arrest it emerged he had made more than 1,000 internet searches about murder, weapons and serial killers. Mr Roberts said that on 4 January he had searched ""how to get away with murder"" and nine days later for ""how to train myself to be a killer"". He said Heeley had also visited websites about psychopaths and when police searched his home they found a book and DVD about serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. The court heard that while at the police station Heeley told a mental health worker he ""had always known he was going to kill someone from an early age"". He was subsequently assessed by staff at Rampton high security hospital who found no diagnosable mental health disorder, but evidence of an ""emerging personality disorder"". During his time there he confessed the killing to a social worker, saying ""he could hear [Leonne's] screams"" and that ""he had demons inside him"". Jailing Heeley, Judge Paul Watson QC said: ""It is clear that it was always your intention to kill her when the two of you met. ""She had done nothing to offend or upset you and she could in no way have anticipated the terrible and merciless attack to which you subjected her. ""Putting it shortly, you killed her for the sake of it. ""You were obsessed with murder and killing and had told one witness just days before you murdered Leonne that you were a psychopath who wanted to kill people and had no remorse."" In a statement read to the court, Leonne's twin brother Levi said she was a ""beautiful, loving and caring person who would never hurt anyone"". Her father, Darren Weeks, said she was taken away ""by the evil act of a cold-hearted killer"". Her mother, Paula, said: ""I never imagined that when Leonne went out that Sunday evening that I would never see her again. It was a normal day but there had been nothing normal about my life since."" Det Ch Insp Martin Tate said the pair had spent time together before the killing and had mutual friends. ""He has robbed a family of a lifetime with their daughter, and of friends and loved ones of making precious memories together.""

"Energy firms will be banned from charging catch-up bills for gas and electricity used more than 12 months earlier. Regulator Ofgem's new rule, to start in May for domestic customers, should stop shock bills of thousands of pounds. Customers who pay via direct debit often receive bills based on estimated meter readings. When an actual reading is taken, the supplier ""back-bills"" the customer for any shortfall. Other supposed arrears have occurred as a result of errors in suppliers' billing systems. Move to cap 'rip-off' energy bills E.On bill changes to raise gas and electricity prices Ofgem said the typical back bill was Â£1,160 and in extreme cases they have exceeded Â£10,000. Most customers struggle to pay and some are driven into debt. The regulator said it was aware of 10,000 complaints in a year. The ban will start in May for domestic customers and in November for the smallest businesses. The only exception is when customers have purposefully prevented the company from taking a reading. A voluntary agreement to stop back-billing of more than 12 months has been in place among the biggest suppliers since 2007. However, some have not fully complied and smaller firms were not signed up. ""Getting billing right is an essential part of customer service, and it's unfair that consumers should be left out of pocket when through no fault of their own they're issued with a shock bill from their supplier,"" said Rob Salter-Church, from Ofgem. Victoria MacGregor, director of energy at Citizens Advice, said: ""We have long called for the changes announced today. The new rules will deliver better protections for households and small businesses across the country. No-one should face a massive unforeseen bill that goes back years when it is their supplier that is at fault. ""Previously we've seen evidence of suppliers trying to game the rules by blaming customers for billing errors, cases where suppliers have ignored their commitments entirely, and small businesses receiving unexpected bills running to tens of thousands of pounds."" Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK said: ""Energy companies take accurate billing very seriously and where there are problems, the majority are resolved within 24 hours. ""Suppliers are actively working to improve billing for their customers. That is why companies covering 80% of the market have signed up to the Energy UK Billing Code to ensure greater accuracy of bills. Audit results of the code show year-on-year improvement and complaint numbers are falling.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows the aid convoy reaching ""hell on earth"" A UN convoy delivering urgently needed aid to the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria has cut short its mission and left the enclave amid shelling. A UN refugee agency official said the convoy - the first since mid-February - delivered as much as it could in Douma town and left after nearly nine hours. But the UNHCR said 10 out of more than 40 trucks had not been emptied. Activists said dozens of people died in air strikes by Syria's army on Monday, despite a supposed five-hour truce. At least 719 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. The UNHCR's Syria representative Sajjad Malik tweeted late on Monday that ""we delivered as much as we could amidst shelling"". ""Civilians are caught in a tragic situation."" Allow Twitter content?

The Syrian Red Crescent earlier said 46 truckloads of food parcels were delivered to 27,500 people, along with health items for more than 70,000 people in the town of Douma. ""The convoy is a positive first step and will lessen the immediate suffering of some civilians in the Eastern Ghouta region,"" said Robert Maridni, Middle East Director of International Committee of the Red Cross.

The Syrian government and its allied forces have reclaimed a third of the Eastern Ghouta in a matter of days, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which has a network of sources on the ground.

He said he supported a Russian-sponsored daily truce of five hours, to allow ""the majority of those in the Eastern Ghouta"" to escape the areas under the control of ""terrorists"". The US has condemned the government assault and said Russia, a key ally of Damascus, is killing innocent civilians. Neither the daily pause ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor the ordering of a nationwide ceasefire by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave.

""Instead of a much-needed reprieve, we continue to see more fighting, more death, and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed,"" UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said on Sunday. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Opposition sources and journalists on the ground say that hundreds of people have been fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa, south of Douma, and on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta. Residents, many of them women and children, are reported to have fled into the centre of the enclave to seek shelter. Fighting has intensified in Beit Sawa between government forces and the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as ""beyond critical"". Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region in two. Syrian state media say the army has advanced on several fronts, and has taken control of villages and farms while attacking from the eastern side of the enclave. The SOHR said government forces were 3km (two miles) from Douma. The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a phone call on Sunday that Syria and its Russian backers bore responsibility for the ""heart-breaking human suffering"", Downing Street said. The leaders agreed that Russia must act now to persuade the Syrian government to stop the bombing.

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south. The centre-left coalition, dominated by the Democratic Party, was punished in traditional strongholds including Emilia-Romagna, the northern region home to the city of Bologna. Voter turnout was estimated at 73% on Monday morning, according to interior ministry figures. Though no party will be able to rule alone based on latest results, the surge of support for populist parties has been compared with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. The right-wing alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy, is tipped to get 248-268 seats - below the 316 needed for a majority. But Five Star will emerge as the largest single party in Italy's lower house, with 216-236 seats. The party was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian election: Its economy in charts Immigration dominates Italian election Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Italian voters appear to have abandoned Mr Renzi's Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is projected to come a distant third, with an estimated 107-127 seats. Immigration and the economy have been two of the key issues for voters during the election. More than 600,000 migrants have travelled from Libya to reach Italy since 2013, which has upset many Italians. The state of the economy was also at the centre of the debates. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate, the upper house of parliament, also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was forecast to take the most seats - around 102-122 - but miss out on a majority. The right-wing coalition is predicted to get 118-150 seats in the upper house, and the Democratic Party 42-54. By James Reynolds BBC News, Milan We still don't know who the winner will be. But in this opening act, Five Star has gained a certain advantage. Its message clearly resonated with young people searching for jobs, and with voters in the poorer south of the country. Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party is among the losers in this election The movement made a big point of running alone in this election. By contrast, other major parties teamed up into electoral alliances. But the feature which gave the party its strength - its independence - may now become its weakness. In order to form a government, Five Star must find coalition partners. Its inexperience in working with others may be a disadvantage in the practical business of coalition-building. So, which way will Five Star seek to turn? There is some speculation that the movement may seek a coalition with the League. Both parties have criticised Italy's relationship with the European Union, although neither campaigns to leave the bloc. A potential alliance between the two would be viewed with some degree of worry in Brussels. The vote comes as a blow to Silvio Berlusconi, 81, whose party led the right-wing coalition. But now Matteo Salvini has laid claim to that role. He has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and spoken of the ""danger"" of Islam. ""My first words: THANK YOU,"" tweeted Mr Salvini as projections rolled in. In any case Mr Berlusconi cannot hold public office himself until next year because of a tax fraud conviction. This video can not be played From 2018: Berlusconi's handshake advice for BBC reporter The leader of the League is a proud Eurosceptic, who has praised Brexit and voiced opposition to the euro in the past. ""It's a fantastic victory which fills us with pride,"" said Mr Salvini on Monday as results came in. He claimed Italian voters had ""made a step forward to be free from the cages and ties that are bringing back hunger and insecurity in Europe"". In the same speech, Mr Salvini repeated his stance that the euro is bad for Italy. ""It's a wrong currency and a wrong choice,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May on housing (and Brexit) Young people without family wealth are ""right to be angry"" at not being able to buy a home, Theresa May has said. Announcing reforms to planning rules in England, the PM said home ownership was largely unaffordable to those not backed by ""the bank of mum and dad"". This disparity was entrenching social inequality and ""exacerbating divisions between generations"", she said. Labour said Mrs May, who has housing as a key priority, should be embarrassed by the ""feeble"" measures proposed. Should baby boomers' wealth be more heavily taxed? Your biggest financial decision - in charts Where can I afford to live? Does England need 300,000 new homes a year? ""This housing crisis is made in Downing Street,"" said shadow housing minister John Healey. ""It's time the Tories changed course, and backed Labour's long-term plan to build the genuinely affordable homes."" In her speech to the National Planning Conference. Mrs May said the existingNational Planning Policy Framework will be overhauled,external, pending a consultation, with up to 80 proposals first put forward last year being implemented. The key measures are: 10% of homes on major sites should be available for affordable home ownership Builders to be more open about affordable housing commitments at planning stage Councils will have to adopt a new nationwide standard showing housing need in their areas Infrastructure needs to be considered at pre-planning stage Councils to consider revoking planning permission after two years if building has not started Ancient Woodland and aged trees to get specific protection A separate review, due to be concluded later this year, will look at creating a new automatic right for homeowners to extend upwards and to make it easier to develop agricultural land for housing. Mrs May said the cost of housing, both for ownership and rent, was reinforcing economic divisions and leading to growing social immobility, with public sector workers unable to take jobs in certain parts of the country. This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this ""The result is a vicious circle from which most people can only escape with help from the bank of mum and dad,"" she said. ""Talking to voters during last year's election campaign, it was clear that many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this. ""Angry that, regardless of how hard they work, they won't be able to buy a place of their own. Angry when they're forced to hand more and more of their wages to a landlord to whom their home is simply a business asset. ""They're right to be angry."" Although the number of planning permissions being granted in England has risen since 2010, the PM said this has not been matched by a corresponding rise in the number of homes being built. She pointed the finger of blame partly at developers who she said have a ""perverse"" financial incentive to hoard land once it had been approved for development rather than actually build on it. She criticised bonuses for construction bosses which are ""based not on the number of homes they build but on their profits or share price"". ""In a market where lower supply equals higher prices, that creates a perverse incentive, one that does not encourage them to build the homes we need,"" she said. Labour wants action to address what it says is a 30-year low in home ownership Housing is a big issue and the government clearly knows it. Theresa May admitted that the election campaign had showed her ""many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this."" So who's fault is it that rents are unaffordable, that accommodation is poor, that home ownership for many is completely out of reach? The prime minister pointed the finger at developers who ""game the system"". Her housing secretary blamed councils for ""nimbyist attitudes"". But both said, too, that there was no ""silver bullet"". When voters get angry though, they will look for someone to blame. Which is why the government is at pains to show it is taking the housing problem seriously. It may take more than a reminder of promises already made and an overhaul of planning guidelines to convince people of that. So expect to see Theresa May in a high visibility vest again before long. There was an outcry last year after Persimmon announced that 140 staff would share a bonus pool of Â£500m and that its chief executive was in line for a payout of Â£110m, a figure that has since been reduced by Â£25m. While the firm defended the payouts, saying they were a reward for success, critics say the tripling of the firm's share price since 2013 was in part due to government subsidies for new homes via the Help to Buy Scheme. Why can't the UK build 240,000 houses a year? ""I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise,"" she said. ""I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs."" Mrs May insisted that ""tearing up"" the Green Belt was not the answer to the UK's housing crisis and that existing protections would be maintained and, in some cases, strengthened. This video can not be played Nick Boles set out what he thought Theresa May's housing speech was lacking Councils will only be able to amend Green Belt boundaries if they can prove they have fully explored every other reasonable option for building the homes their community needs. The Local Government Association said it was wrong to blame councils as they were approving nine out of ten proposed developments and yet more than 420,000 homes with permission were still waiting to be built. ""No-one can live in a planning permission,"" said its chair Lord Porter. ""Developers need to get on with building affordable homes with the needed infrastructure and councils need greater powers to act where housebuilding has stalled."" This video can not be played CPRE suggests building more new homes in northern England The Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said the PM was only ""tinkering at the edges"" of what was needed to boost the supply of new homes and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the ""speech overlooked entirely the role central government must play... private developers and local authorities cannot do this alone"". Housing charity Shelter said Mrs May was right to close ""loopholes"" being used by developers to reduce affordable housing levels. The Resolution Foundation welcomed the call for local government and housebuilding firms to do more, but also said the government needed to do more and said it was now ""time for action, not just discussion"" on private renting In her speech the PM also said homelessness was a ""source of national shame"" and Â£1bn was being spent to halve rough sleeping. Housing policy is devolved in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish government has pledged to build 50,000 new affordable homes by 2021 whilethe Welsh government launched two schemeslast week designed to help more people onto the housing ladder.

"This endangered beetle is found under dead branches The loss of trees across Europe is pushing beetles to the brink of extinction, according to a new report. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature assessed the status of 700 European beetles that live in old and hollowed wood. Almost a fifth (18%) are at risk of extinction due to the decline of ancient trees, the European Red List of Saproxylic Beetles report found. This puts them among the most threatened insect groups in Europe. Saproxylic beetles play a role in natural processes, such as decomposition and the recycling of nutrients. They also provide an important food source for birds and mammals and some are involved in pollination. ""Some beetle species require old trees that need hundreds of years to grow, so conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees across different landscapes in Europe, to ensure that the vital ecosystem services provided by these beetles continue,"" said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN Global Species Programme. Beetles are food for birds and mammals Logging, tree loss and wood harvesting all contribute to the loss of habitat for the beetles, said the IUCN. Other major threats include urbanisation and tourism development, and an increase in wildfires in the Mediterranean region. Conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees and deadwood across forests, pastureland, orchards and urban areas, the report recommended. It said there should be inventories of ancient and veteran trees for each European country, to ensure these trees are protected in all landscapes. ""It is critical for the Common Agricultural Policy to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,"" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. The report pointed to the need for different ages of trees in the landscape, including saplings, mature trees, ancient trees, standing dead trees, fallen tree trunks and stumps. It said some progress had been made in the forestry sector, while the importance of deadwood is being increasingly acknowledged in many countries. In Europe, there are 58 families of beetles, made up of nearly 29,000 species. About 4,000 are thought to rely on dead and decaying wood for at least part of their lifecycle. However, for many of these species data is lacking, suggesting more monitoring is urgently needed. ""The population trend of half the species assessed remains unknown,"" said Keith Alexander, IUCN Saproxylic Beetles Specialist Advisor. He said that three of the species from the list were found in the UK, including a type of longhorn beetle that lives only on veteran oak trees. He called for raised public awareness of their conservation needs. ""Some of these beetles are incredibly beautiful interesting things - if people stopped and looked at them and appreciated them, they'd realise they're just as worthy of conservation as elephants and tigers,"" he told the BBC. ""And these things live in the countryside on our doorstep."" Stictoleptura erythropteraneeds large veteran trees with cavities, and is therefore dependent on the preservation of old trees. This species was assessed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, which said its main threat was the continuing loss of old trees across its range. Iphthiminus italicushas been assessed as endangered due to forestry practices and wildfires. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Footage shows the aid convoy reaching ""hell on earth"" A UN convoy delivering urgently needed aid to the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria has cut short its mission and left the enclave amid shelling. A UN refugee agency official said the convoy - the first since mid-February - delivered as much as it could in Douma town and left after nearly nine hours. But the UNHCR said 10 out of more than 40 trucks had not been emptied. Activists said dozens of people died in air strikes by Syria's army on Monday, despite a supposed five-hour truce. At least 719 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. The UNHCR's Syria representative Sajjad Malik tweeted late on Monday that ""we delivered as much as we could amidst shelling"". ""Civilians are caught in a tragic situation."" Allow Twitter content?

""The convoy is a positive first step and will lessen the immediate suffering of some civilians in the Eastern Ghouta region,"" said Robert Maridni, Middle East Director of International Committee of the Red Cross.

The Syrian government and its allied forces have reclaimed a third of the Eastern Ghouta in a matter of days, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which has a network of sources on the ground.

He said he supported a Russian-sponsored daily truce of five hours, to allow ""the majority of those in the Eastern Ghouta"" to escape the areas under the control of ""terrorists"". The US has condemned the government assault and said Russia, a key ally of Damascus, is killing innocent civilians. Neither the daily pause ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor the ordering of a nationwide ceasefire by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave.

""Instead of a much-needed reprieve, we continue to see more fighting, more death, and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed,"" UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said on Sunday. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Opposition sources and journalists on the ground say that hundreds of people have been fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa, south of Douma, and on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta. Residents, many of them women and children, are reported to have fled into the centre of the enclave to seek shelter. Fighting has intensified in Beit Sawa between government forces and the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as ""beyond critical"". Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region in two. Syrian state media say the army has advanced on several fronts, and has taken control of villages and farms while attacking from the eastern side of the enclave. The SOHR said government forces were 3km (two miles) from Douma. The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists.

"This video can not be played Justin Davies, managing director of First Cymru, says it will make services more efficient Late-running buses in Swansea will be able to make up time because they have been fixed with trackers which will tell traffic lights to turn green. GPS tracks where the buses are with what time they should be at each bus stop. If they are running on time, the lights will operate in their usual sequence but that will change for a late bus. The system has started operating in the city centre and will be expanded to other key routes. First Cymru, which runs services in the city, believes it is the only area in Wales using the system. 'Decade to overhaul Swansea's transport' Are smart transport systems vulnerable to hackers? Near-miss bus driver: 'My training kicked in' ""We have the ability to know exactly where our vehicles are minute by minute as the day progresses,"" said the firm's managing director Justin Davies. ""As we collect that data, that's going to be transmitted into the local authority in Swansea. ""If a bus is running a little bit late, the traffic lights will change to favour the bus to enable its journey to be slightly speeded up and catch up the time. ""Where the bus is running normally the traffic light sequence will be absolutely as it is."" Similar technology is already in use or is being discussed in other parts of the UK, including London, Newcastle and Cambridge. More than Â£300,000 has been spent by Swansea council to install the technology on traffic lights following a Welsh Government grant. But Mr Davies said it was very cheap to run and was already having an impact. ""Because we've got so much more information now than we've previously had, we're starting to see quite clearly where the timetables don't quite work or where the services aren't working as well as we want them to - the punctuality isn't where it needs to be,"" he added. ""We need to go through the process of adjusting the timetables, work out where we need to take some time away from journeys or even add a bit of time in.""

"This endangered beetle is found under dead branches The loss of trees across Europe is pushing beetles to the brink of extinction, according to a new report. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature assessed the status of 700 European beetles that live in old and hollowed wood. Almost a fifth (18%) are at risk of extinction due to the decline of ancient trees, the European Red List of Saproxylic Beetles report found. This puts them among the most threatened insect groups in Europe. Saproxylic beetles play a role in natural processes, such as decomposition and the recycling of nutrients. They also provide an important food source for birds and mammals and some are involved in pollination. ""Some beetle species require old trees that need hundreds of years to grow, so conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees across different landscapes in Europe, to ensure that the vital ecosystem services provided by these beetles continue,"" said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN Global Species Programme. Beetles are food for birds and mammals Logging, tree loss and wood harvesting all contribute to the loss of habitat for the beetles, said the IUCN. Other major threats include urbanisation and tourism development, and an increase in wildfires in the Mediterranean region. Conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees and deadwood across forests, pastureland, orchards and urban areas, the report recommended. It said there should be inventories of ancient and veteran trees for each European country, to ensure these trees are protected in all landscapes. ""It is critical for the Common Agricultural Policy to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,"" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. The report pointed to the need for different ages of trees in the landscape, including saplings, mature trees, ancient trees, standing dead trees, fallen tree trunks and stumps. It said some progress had been made in the forestry sector, while the importance of deadwood is being increasingly acknowledged in many countries. In Europe, there are 58 families of beetles, made up of nearly 29,000 species. About 4,000 are thought to rely on dead and decaying wood for at least part of their lifecycle. However, for many of these species data is lacking, suggesting more monitoring is urgently needed. ""The population trend of half the species assessed remains unknown,"" said Keith Alexander, IUCN Saproxylic Beetles Specialist Advisor. He said that three of the species from the list were found in the UK, including a type of longhorn beetle that lives only on veteran oak trees. He called for raised public awareness of their conservation needs. ""Some of these beetles are incredibly beautiful interesting things - if people stopped and looked at them and appreciated them, they'd realise they're just as worthy of conservation as elephants and tigers,"" he told the BBC. ""And these things live in the countryside on our doorstep."" Stictoleptura erythropteraneeds large veteran trees with cavities, and is therefore dependent on the preservation of old trees. This species was assessed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, which said its main threat was the continuing loss of old trees across its range. Iphthiminus italicushas been assessed as endangered due to forestry practices and wildfires. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"Among the delegates meeting Kim Jong-un was Chung Eui-yong, head of Seoul's presidential National Security Office North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hosted a dinner for senior South Korean delegates - the first time officials from Seoul have met the young leader since he took office in 2011. The South Korean president's office confirmed the meeting shortly after the delegates' arrival on Monday. The 10-member team is in Pyongyang for talks partly aimed at restarting dialogue between the North and the US. Relations between the Koreas have warmed following last month's Olympics. In an unprecedented move, the South Korean delegation includes two ministerial-level envoys - intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security adviser Chung Eui-yong. North Korean state radio earlier said the delegation was met at the airport by Ri Son-gwon, North Korea's reunification chief, who led talks in the weeks before the Winter Olympics. During the two-day visit, the South Korean group will focus on establishing conditions for talks aimed at getting rid of the North's nuclear weapons as well as dialogue between the US and Pyongyang. Mr Chung had earlier told a press briefing he would deliver President Moon Jae-in's ""resolution to maintain the dialogue and improvement in relations between the South and the North... [and] to denuclearize the Korean peninsula"". ""I plan to hold in-depth discussions on various ways to continue talks between not only the South and the North, but also the North and the United States,"" he added. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the US would be prepared to meet North Korea, but reiterated that Pyongyang would first have to ""denuke"". However, North Korea - which has said it wants to talk to the US - said it was ""preposterous"" for the US to insist on preconditions. ""The US attitude shown after we clarified our intention for dialogue compels us to only think that the US is not interested in resuming... dialogue,"" said the foreign ministry in a statement reported by state media. It remains unclear who would represent the US in any such meeting. Winter Olympics: Is window for US-North Korea peace closing? North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' By Laura Bicker, BBC Seoul Correspondent The South Korean team (left) met North Korean officials, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (not shown here) later hosted a dinner Kim Jong-un meeting South Korean ministers face to face for the first time is a pretty big deal. He has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011, and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. But the young North Korean leader appears to be turning on the charm, again - treating the South Koreans to a banquet. However, the after-dinner conversation could be awkward. South Korea really needs Pyongyang and Washington to talk to one another. The problem is the two sides have different terms when it comes to even starting those discussions. President Trump has said Kim Jong-un must be willing to ""denuke"". North Korea has rejected this precondition, and has some of its own - especially over joint US-South Korea military drills, due to resume in April. It's going to take some deft diplomatic skills over dinner to try to get these two sides together before those exercises begin. The top US diplomat on North Korea Joseph Yun announced his decision to retire earlier last week, a departure which could hamper the Trump administration. Analysts believe that Mr Yun was very much in favour of compromise and diplomacy with North Korea. Joseph Yun leaves his post as a US special representative for North Korea policy without a successor The relationship between the US and North Korea was particularly tense before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, with both countries repeatedly threatening each other with total destruction. But the Games saw the two Koreas march together under a single flag - the outcome of the first inter-Korean talks in two years. The question now being asked is whetherNorth Korea's participation in the Paralympics, starting this week, can lead to an even bigger breakthrough. The US has distanced itself from the North Korean overtures during the Games. US Vice-President Mike Pence has said there is ""no daylight"" between the US and its regional allies on the need to ""continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programme. North Korea has also issued a warning about the scheduled US-South Korea military drills, which it views as a provocation. The next set of exercises is due to begin in April. A report last week in the ruling party's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the military exercises ""cannot be tolerated under any circumstances"". ""Their (intention) is to blow away the atmosphere of improved North-South relations... this should be regarded as outrageously insane behaviour by confrontation fanatics who are anxious to bring about disaster,"" the report read.

"The nuclear-powered carrier set anchor off the port city of Danang US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is making a historic call at Vietnam, the first time a ship of this size has visited since the Vietnam War ended. The nuclear-powered carrier set anchor off the port city of Danang, where US combat troops first landed in the war, making this a highly symbolic location. The visit is meant to demonstrate the countries' growing military ties. But analysts say it inevitably sends a message to China as it continues to develop the disputed South China Sea. It comes as  China announced a military budget of 1.11 trillion yuan, an 8% increase on last year, as its annual meeting of parliament got under way in Beijing. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in Danang, says that while co-operation between the US and Vietnam's military has grown it is still limited, and Vietnam has to manage the messaging of this visit carefully. China is now the de facto superpower in this region, and by far the most important trading partner for Vietnam. So Vietnam's communist leadership is taking care to avoid any steps that might upset relations with its giant neighbour, our correspondent says. Analysis: The US woos an old enemy as China waits in the wings China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including reefs and islands also claimed by other nations. Vietnam specifically exercises claims over the Paracel and Spratly islands. The USS Carl Vinson is a so-called ""Nimitz-class"" nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and supports thousands of sailors and pilots The US has always said it does not take sides in the South China Sea dispute, but the US Navy has consistently run so-called ""freedom of navigation"" operations through disputed waters, a clear challenge to China's territorial ambitions. The USS Carl Vinson has made many journeys to the wider region in its decades of service and was last in the sea just days ago. Danang was a major US military base during the Vietnam War.  The docking of the vast vessel, which can support up to 90 aircraft, will represent the largest US military presence in Vietnam since the end of many years of bitter conflict and after the country was unified in 1975. The Vietnam War - which Vietnam calls the American War - was protracted and bloody. The Vietnamese government estimates that millions of Vietnamese, both civilian and Communist fighters, were killed. Just over 58,000American soldiers were killed or went missing in action.,external The presence of a US aircraft carrier in Danang, one which will be conducting so-called ""freedom of navigation"" passages through the disputed areas of the South China Sea, also sends a potentially provocative message to China - but only a symbolic one. To date US expressions of concern over China's actions in the sea have had no discernable impact on the construction of military facilities there. The US carrier strike group looks impressive, but it is not clear what it can actually do to restrain China. Even as Vietnam's top brass enjoy watching the full might of the superpower they once fought now paying court as a would-be ally, they must remain mindful of the continuing historic shift in the balance of power in their region away from the United States, in favour of China.

"Jimmy Kimmel joked that Oscar ""keeps his hands where you can see them"" Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel aimed barbs at Harvey Weinstein at the first Academy Awards sinceHollywood's sexual harassment scandal,externalunfolded. Openingthe Oscars,external, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. ""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most."" But unlike at the Baftas and Golden Globes, where stars wore black as a show of defiance and solidarity, there was no such dress code at the Oscars. The Oscars ceremony as it happened The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand rule the Oscars Weinstein statue appears in Hollywood ahead of Oscars Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? Weinstein is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and sexual harassment. The Oscar-winning producer has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex against him. Near the start of his opening monologue, Kimmel joked about the reputation of men in Hollywood. Pointing at a life-sized Oscars statuette, he said: ""Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood, and there's a very good reason why. Just look at him. ""Keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word, and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations, and that's the kind of men we need more of in this town."" Salma Hayek said ""future generations will have it easier"" The US talk show host said the downfall of Weinstein, and the reforms that had begun since, had not come soon enough. ""What happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was long overdue,"" he said. ""We can't let bad behaviour slide any more. The world is watching us."" Kimmel attempted to balance gravity with humour in his remarks about how Hollywood was attempting to put its house in order. ""We need to set an example and the truth is if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go,"" he said.

Referring to The Shape of Water, in which a cleaning lady falls in love with a mysterious river creature, Kimmel joked: ""We will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly that women started dating fish."" Weinstein has been one of the dominant figures at the Oscars over the past two decades, producing winning films like Shakespeare in Love and The King's Speech. He may not have been at this year's ceremony, but some of his accusers were. Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino - two of Weinstein's accusers - arrived together They included Salma Hayek, who said on the red carpet: ""Here we are to celebrate the fact that women will not have to struggle as hard together. I know that future generations will have it easier."" Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd, who were among the first to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, sent an optimistic message as they spoke to US TV network ABC. Judd said women's voices had been ""squelched"" in the past, but that they were emerging as ""phoenixes"". ""What's so spectacular about this moment is that finally the world is able to hear,"" she said. ""Those of us who have come forward were often then disbelieved, minimised, shamed, and so much of the movement is about putting that shame back where it belongs, which is with the perpetrator."" Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek spoke about Time's Up Sorvino said: ""I want people to know that this movement isn't stopping. We're going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women... ""We want to take our activism and our power into action and change things for every woman everywhere working in any workplace."" They were supporting the Time's Up movement, which has raised $21m (Â£15.2m) to fund legal support for victims of sexual misconduct in all walks of life. Although there was no all-black dress code, some guests did wear Time's Up badges in support of the campaign. Judd, Hayek and another of accuser, Annabella Sciorra, later appeared on stage in a segment about Time's Up. They introduced a film about how the film industry is being opened up, featuring Sorvino, Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig, Dee Rees, Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Jenkins and Geena Davis.

"This video can not be played Chinook flies in supplies to cut-off Cumbrian communities An RAF Chinook helicopter has flown food and supplies to areas in Cumbria cut off by snow for five days. The aircraft, carrying Royal Marines, took off from Carlisle Airport earlier to aid snowed-in communities around Fellside, South Stainmore and Alston. Supplies included food, fuel, medicines and electrical heating appliances and came as many residents said they were ""burning furniture"" to keep warm. The operation, dubbed Boomster, could continue on Tuesday if required. Soldiers were accompanied by police and mountain rescue personnel. Logs for heating were among supplies dropped off by soldiers near Kirkby Stephen Residents and farmers trapped for five days were happy to see supplies arrive Supplies of food and logs for heating were crammed into the chinook Nenthead, near Alston, is completely cut off by snow Laura Seaton, 38, from the village of Nenthead, near Alston, said: ""We've got a hell of a lot of houses that have been completely and utterly cut off, to the point where they had to be dug out just to get out of their front door, because the drifts that have been up there have been quite incredible. ""There are people who are running out of solid fuel and when that runs out people have been burning their own furniture because the coal merchants down in Alston weren't able to get to the back end of the village. ""It has been pretty horrendous up here."" Mrs Seaton and her husband Jamie, 46, were part of a team of about 40 volunteers who set out to take supplies to people trapped in nearby areas on Sunday after the tough conditions threatened to stop them from stocking up on food and water. WO Roger Atkinson said the those who had been cut off by the snow had been ""bearing up well"" Many homes had been without food and fuel for days A snowblower has been used to clear a road leading to the hamlet of Parkhead near Kirkoswald The Chinook is flying aid to snowed-in communities in Fellside, South Stainmore and Alston Some villages have been cut off for days Natalie Lewis, from Park Head near Lazonby and who had spent 30 hours without electricity, said she was ""relieved"" help had finally arrived. She said: ""The soldiers have been so helpful. They went around and made sure everything was safe."" Warrant Officer Roger Atkinson of the Royal Marines, said: ""Considering what people have been through over the past few days, they have have been bearing up well. ""Our men have just spent two months in Norway doing cold weather warfare training, so we've been very comfortable in this environment. ""We will probably be doing more of the same tomorrow."" County council leader Stewart Young said: ""Despite our very best efforts, and our crews working day and night, we are experiencing ongoing significant challenges in accessing some of our communities. ""The depth of snow and the challenging nature of the terrain is making progress on clearing roads exceptionally slow. ""As a result it is estimated it will be at least 48 hours before we reach many more of these communities, hence the need to bring in military assistance and we are very grateful for their help."" A yellow weather warning for ice issued by the Met Office was in place for areas, including Cumbria, until 11:00 GMT. Wing Commander Gary Lane, RAF Regional Liaison Officer for the North West, said: ""The Chinook helicopter gives the partnership another dimension to be able to deliver vital supplies by air to areas that are cut off by other means.""

"The widow of one of the troops killed later became embroiled in a row with US President Donald Trump The Islamic State (IS) group has published a video purporting to show an ambush in Niger in which four US soldiers were killed last October. It is not clear why the release of the video - via an IS outlet on messaging app Telegram - was delayed until now. The video consists mainly of raw footage, including images apparently filmed using a helmet camera belonging to one of the soldiers. The video seems to suggest that the attack was carried out by IS militants. The deaths became a major political row in the USwhen the widow of one of the soldiers, Army Sgt La David Johnson, said President Donald Trump had made her cry during a condolence phone call by suggesting her husband ""knew what he signed up for"". The president later called a US congresswoman's account of the phone call ""totally fabricated"". The propaganda film begins with still images showing an alleged pledge of allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by members of the Sahel-based group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM was formed from a number of West African jihadist groups in March 2017, and originally had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. This alleged switch to IS was reported last month by a number of analysts, but it had not been promoted by IS outlets on social media. How IS wages its social media war Apple removes Telegram from app store The graphic video shows several armed militants walking and running in a desert area, apparently heading for the ambush, reports BBC Monitoring. The soldiers are seen driving away in a white vehicle, with coloured smoke grenades providing cover. After a cut in the video, the US soldiers are seen around another vehicle, with one soldier driving and the other two walking beside while seemingly firing at their attackers. Then, one of the soldiers drops to the ground. The man wearing the helmet camera tries to raise the fallen man. How did US soldiers come under attack in Niger? More remains of US soldier found in Niger Niger country profile The soldier driving the vehicle jumps out and helps drag the soldier to cover, before he and the camera-wearer run into the scrub. While running, the soldier wearing the camera falls to the ground. The footage ends with the camera unmoving, and militants surrounding the soldier, firing at point-blank range. La David Johnson, one of the US soldiers killed in the attack The deaths in Niger sparked controversy after President Donald Trump's phone call to the widow of Sgt La David Johnson. Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who knew the soldier in question, heard the call while en route to meet his body with his family, and said the president did not seem to know his name. President Trump denied forgetting Sgt Johnson's name in the call, saying he spoke it ""without hesitation"". He said it had been a ""very nice conversation"". Allow Twitter content?

Sgt Johnson's body was initially located two days after the ambush, while the bodies of the other three soldiers were discovered on the same day they were attacked, on 4 October 2017. The US has about 800 troops in Niger, which they say are there to help train local forces and support counter-terrorism efforts. But questions have emerged about why the US troops were not more heavily armed for the failed mission. ""We should have gotten this information a long time ago,"" Texas Congressman Marc Veasey told CBS News on Sunday. ""Why they were asked to continue to go onto this mission I think is something that we all need to find out."" The Pentagon is due to release the results of their investigation into the ambush as soon as this week, CBS reports. This was the first time US troops were killed in combat in Niger.

"This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" Homes across the UK are facing water supply problems - with thousands of people in Wales and south-east England urged to use as little as possible. Water suppliers say a thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks. About 13,000 homes are still without water in Kent and Sussex while thousands of properties in Wales and 5,000 homes in London also have no supply. The industry regulator Ofwat has said water firms,externalhave ""fallen well short"". Suppliers across the country say teams are working to fix damaged pipes that have left customers with no supply or low pressure. Water companies said cracks and splits had been caused by the freeze which are now being exposed as the pipes thaw. Parts of the Midlands, south-west England and Scotland are also affected. West Midlands-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has agreed to stop production to preserve the water supply for homes, hospitals and schools. Chocolate maker Cadbury also sent workers home from its Bournville plant but said it was able to continue some limited production. In south-east England and Birmingham, suppliers say they have been identifying vulnerable customers and providing them with bottled water. Thames Water have been handing out bottles of water Thames Water said on Monday 10,000 homes in SW16 and NW3 postcodes in London have no water At its peak, more than 20,000 homes in south and north London were left without water on Sunday. Supplier Thames Water said the number of homes affected was constantly falling and was down to about 5,000 by Monday evening. The company said it was taking longer than expected to restore supplies to homes in the SW12, SW15 SW16 and SW17 postcodes. It said households in NW2, NW3, NW5, NW11, N2, N6, N10 and N19 may still be facing low pressure but staff were working in those areas. The company says it distributed almost a million litres of water across the weekend and was continuing to offer to supplies to households in the affected areas of London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that thousands of homes in the capital still lacked water. Several schools in London and Kent were closed on Monday because they were unable to guarantee running water. South East Water set up a number of bottled water stations in Sussex and Kent where 13,000 homes had been affected. Southern Water, which had urged customers to ""only use the water you absolutely must"", said it was restoring the supply to 5,000 homes in Sittingbourne, Kent but there were still 900 homes without water in Hastings and interruptions to supplies in the Crawley area. Severn Trent said it had seen a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes compared with a typical day Work is under way to repair pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw In Wales,about 3,500 customers are without water, Welsh Water said. Thousands of customersare also without water in parts of Birmingham, the West Midlands and Staffordshire. Yorkshire Water, United Utilities, Affinity Water, Anglian Water and Bristol Water also reported problems. Severn Trent, which said it had seen an increase in reports of burst pipes, thanked Coventry-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover for agreeing to stop production ""to help us target our supply"". South West Water said it has an ""unprecedented number of burst water mains"" and warned some customers in Devon and Cornwall that, although water can be used, there is a ""noticeable taste"".

"Sinn FÃ©in shared a meeting of minds at talks with the EU's chief negotiator on Monday, the party said. Party President Mary Lou McDonald made the comments after she and her party colleagues met Michel Barnier in Brussels. It follows comments from Prime Minister Theresa May that she did not want to see a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Ms McDonald said the issue was now ""in Mrs May's court"". Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan May urges EU to embrace 'ambitious' Brexit Reality Check: What does the EU Brexit draft reveal? Johnson says NI border row being exploited She said the British government had to come up with Plan A and Plan B, and there could be be no overall agreement on Brexit unless the issue of the border was solved. The Sinn FÃ©in leader said her party was ""not looking for a border down the Irish Sea"". She said there was now a challenge for Mr Barnier to ""hold steady"", but that ""he gets it"" on the issue of Brexit and the border. Mrs May has also said she did not want a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister was responding to a legal text published by the EU as part of the Brexit negotiations with the UK. The EU's draft legal agreement proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Mr Barnier hosted a Sinn FÃ©in delegation including party president Mary Lou McDonald, vice president Michelle O'Neill and MEPs Martina Anderson and Matt Carthy. Sinn FÃ©in is keen to stress that there should be a special status for Northern Ireland. The party wants to know how Brexit will affect cross-border workers and will insist that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement must be protected. The Sinn FÃ©in president believes the only way to avoid a hard border is for Northern Ireland to remain within the customs union and single market. Mary Lou McDonald has said a hard border can only be avoided if NI stays within the customs union and single market The Irish border question is at the heart of EU-UK discussions and although a number of options have been tabled, there is no agreed plan of what life will look like after Brexit. Mr Barnier set up the series of meetings this week with Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to gauge opinion. On Tuesday, he will get a very different perspective when he hosts the DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds in Brussels. The DUP opposes special status for Northern Ireland and are against staying in the customs union or single market. The party insists that recent EU proposals would break up the UK. Nigel Dodds has said an internal border would be ""catastrophic"" for Northern Ireland to be ""cut off"" from UK. Last week, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK. Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short.""

The Silent Child, which tells the story of a girl who struggles to communicate, was named best live action short film. It stars Maisie Sly, aged six, from Swindon, and Rachel Shenton, who played Mitzeee Minniver in the Channel 4 soap. Shenton also wrote it and used sign language in her acceptance speech. It was directed by Chris Overton - AKA Hollyoaks cage fighter Liam McAllister. The Oscars ceremony as it happened The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand rule the Oscars In pictures: Red carpet glamour Watch highlights from the Oscars red carpet ""I made a promise to our six-year-old lead actress that I would sign this speech,"" Shenton said while accepting the statuette at Sunday's ceremony in Hollywood. ""My hands are shaking a little bit so I apologise,"" she added. This video can not be played Oscars 2018: Shenton promised to sign her speech Maisie didn't go up on stage to collect the award, but Overton told BBC 5 live: ""When we won I could see her up there jumping up and down and that was surreal. Maisie Sly walked the red carpet with Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton ""But I think she's taken it all in her stride. She always said we'd win."" Shenton added: ""She held the Oscar, she said it was very heavy, she had her photograph taken with it and then said she wanted to go back and see her brothers and sisters, so she's keeping it real."" One mother, two school shootings Employers warned over snow days pay dock Trump threatens tax on EU cars The Silent Child tells the story of a profoundly deaf four-year-old called Libby, played by Maisie.

You can't see it and it's not life threatening so I want to say the biggest of thank yous to the Academy for allowing us to put this in front of a mainstream audience.""

In his acceptance speech, Overton thanked Shenton - his fiancee. He said: ""It's really your hard work for the last 12 years that has really made this project authentic."" Overton also thanked their parents for making cup cakes to raise funds for the film, and those who backed its crowdfunding campaign. He told BBC Breakfast they raised ""over Â£1,000 in cupcakes"". ""My mum and dad made the cupcakes and Rachel's mum and her mum's partner Nigel sold them at their work,"" he said. ""We crowdfunded this all by ourselves and we had the support of so many people, but it was made on a shoestring."" The pair cast Maisie, who had never acted before, after a nationwide search involved advertising on the websites of deaf organisations. They auditioned 100 children before they found their star. Maisie's family had recently relocated 160 miles from Plymouth to Swindon so Maisie could attend a mainstream school where deaf children are supported.

"Cardinal George Pell arrives at a court in Melbourne on Monday Cardinal George Pell has returned to an Australian court for a hearing that will determine whether he stands trial on sexual assault charges. The Catholic cleric, 76, has strongly denied what police have described as historical accusations by ""multiple complainants"" in the state of Victoria. He will plead not guilty to all charges, his lawyer said last year. The court hearing in Melbourne is expected to run for a month. Much of it will be closed to the public and media. Cardinal Pell was given a police escort into the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Monday as dozens of media representatives and bystanders watched on. Inside, his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, accused police of investigating the cardinal with a ""presumption of guilt"". Australia's most senior Catholic figure is considered the third-ranking official at the Vatican, where he is in charge of the Church's finances. Last year, Cardinal Pell took a leave of absence from the Vatican to fight the sexual assault charges in Australia. Last June, Victoria Police charged Cardinal Pell with ""multiple"" sexual offence charges involving ""multiple complainants"". Authorities described the accusations as historical, but did not give further details. On Friday, prosecutors dropped one charge. Last year, Cardinal Pell said: ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me."" About 50 witnesses are expected to give evidence at the month-long hearing In a hearing in October, Cardinal Pell's barrister, Robert Richter QC, said he intended to prove that ""what was alleged was impossible"". During a 25-minute administrative hearing, Mr Richter argued that Victoria Police had not followed correct procedure in their investigation. ""We say that was not followed because there was a presumption of guilt,"" he said. He also accused police of not properly investigating witness statements that had been provided by the defence. The court was later closed to the public for witnesses to give evidence, as required by state law in sexual offence cases. As many as 50 witnesses are expected to testify in closed sessions for up to two weeks. The committal hearing is likely to run for four weeks in total, local media said. The first witnesses were expected to give testimony via video link late on Monday. At the end of committal hearing, Magistrate Belinda Wallington will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to proceed to a trial in the County Court of Victoria. The cardinal may then be required to enter a plea.

"The nuclear-powered carrier set anchor off the port city of Danang US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is making a historic call at Vietnam, the first time a ship of this size has visited since the Vietnam War ended. The nuclear-powered carrier set anchor off the port city of Danang, where US combat troops first landed in the war, making this a highly symbolic location. The visit is meant to demonstrate the countries' growing military ties. But analysts say it inevitably sends a message to China as it continues to develop the disputed South China Sea. It comes as  China announced a military budget of 1.11 trillion yuan, an 8% increase on last year, as its annual meeting of parliament got under way in Beijing. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in Danang, says that while co-operation between the US and Vietnam's military has grown it is still limited, and Vietnam has to manage the messaging of this visit carefully. China is now the de facto superpower in this region, and by far the most important trading partner for Vietnam. So Vietnam's communist leadership is taking care to avoid any steps that might upset relations with its giant neighbour, our correspondent says. Analysis: The US woos an old enemy as China waits in the wings China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including reefs and islands also claimed by other nations. Vietnam specifically exercises claims over the Paracel and Spratly islands. The USS Carl Vinson is a so-called ""Nimitz-class"" nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and supports thousands of sailors and pilots The US has always said it does not take sides in the South China Sea dispute, but the US Navy has consistently run so-called ""freedom of navigation"" operations through disputed waters, a clear challenge to China's territorial ambitions. The USS Carl Vinson has made many journeys to the wider region in its decades of service and was last in the sea just days ago. Danang was a major US military base during the Vietnam War.  The docking of the vast vessel, which can support up to 90 aircraft, will represent the largest US military presence in Vietnam since the end of many years of bitter conflict and after the country was unified in 1975. The Vietnam War - which Vietnam calls the American War - was protracted and bloody. The Vietnamese government estimates that millions of Vietnamese, both civilian and Communist fighters, were killed. Just over 58,000American soldiers were killed or went missing in action.,external The presence of a US aircraft carrier in Danang, one which will be conducting so-called ""freedom of navigation"" passages through the disputed areas of the South China Sea, also sends a potentially provocative message to China - but only a symbolic one. To date US expressions of concern over China's actions in the sea have had no discernable impact on the construction of military facilities there. The US carrier strike group looks impressive, but it is not clear what it can actually do to restrain China. Even as Vietnam's top brass enjoy watching the full might of the superpower they once fought now paying court as a would-be ally, they must remain mindful of the continuing historic shift in the balance of power in their region away from the United States, in favour of China.

You can't see it and it's not life threatening so I want to say the biggest of thank yous to the Academy for allowing us to put this in front of a mainstream audience.""

In his acceptance speech, Overton thanked Shenton - his fiancee. He said: ""It's really your hard work for the last 12 years that has really made this project authentic."" Overton also thanked their parents for making cup cakes to raise funds for the film, and those who backed its crowdfunding campaign. He told BBC Breakfast they raised ""over Â£1,000 in cupcakes"". ""My mum and dad made the cupcakes and Rachel's mum and her mum's partner Nigel sold them at their work,"" he said. ""We crowdfunded this all by ourselves and we had the support of so many people, but it was made on a shoestring."" The pair cast Maisie, who had never acted before, after a nationwide search involved advertising on the websites of deaf organisations. They auditioned 100 children before they found their star. Maisie's family had recently relocated 160 miles from Plymouth to Swindon so Maisie could attend a mainstream school where deaf children are supported.

"Jimmy Kimmel joked that Oscar ""keeps his hands where you can see them"" Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel aimed barbs at Harvey Weinstein at the first Academy Awards sinceHollywood's sexual harassment scandal,externalunfolded. Openingthe Oscars,external, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. ""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most."" But unlike at the Baftas and Golden Globes, where stars wore black as a show of defiance and solidarity, there was no such dress code at the Oscars. The Oscars ceremony as it happened The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand rule the Oscars Weinstein statue appears in Hollywood ahead of Oscars Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? Weinstein is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and sexual harassment. The Oscar-winning producer has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex against him. Near the start of his opening monologue, Kimmel joked about the reputation of men in Hollywood. Pointing at a life-sized Oscars statuette, he said: ""Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood, and there's a very good reason why. Just look at him. ""Keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word, and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations, and that's the kind of men we need more of in this town."" Salma Hayek said ""future generations will have it easier"" The US talk show host said the downfall of Weinstein, and the reforms that had begun since, had not come soon enough. ""What happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was long overdue,"" he said. ""We can't let bad behaviour slide any more. The world is watching us."" Kimmel attempted to balance gravity with humour in his remarks about how Hollywood was attempting to put its house in order. ""We need to set an example and the truth is if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go,"" he said.

Referring to The Shape of Water, in which a cleaning lady falls in love with a mysterious river creature, Kimmel joked: ""We will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly that women started dating fish."" Weinstein has been one of the dominant figures at the Oscars over the past two decades, producing winning films like Shakespeare in Love and The King's Speech. He may not have been at this year's ceremony, but some of his accusers were. Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino - two of Weinstein's accusers - arrived together They included Salma Hayek, who said on the red carpet: ""Here we are to celebrate the fact that women will not have to struggle as hard together. I know that future generations will have it easier."" Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd, who were among the first to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, sent an optimistic message as they spoke to US TV network ABC. Judd said women's voices had been ""squelched"" in the past, but that they were emerging as ""phoenixes"". ""What's so spectacular about this moment is that finally the world is able to hear,"" she said. ""Those of us who have come forward were often then disbelieved, minimised, shamed, and so much of the movement is about putting that shame back where it belongs, which is with the perpetrator."" Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek spoke about Time's Up Sorvino said: ""I want people to know that this movement isn't stopping. We're going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women... ""We want to take our activism and our power into action and change things for every woman everywhere working in any workplace."" They were supporting the Time's Up movement, which has raised $21m (Â£15.2m) to fund legal support for victims of sexual misconduct in all walks of life. Although there was no all-black dress code, some guests did wear Time's Up badges in support of the campaign. Judd, Hayek and another of accuser, Annabella Sciorra, later appeared on stage in a segment about Time's Up. They introduced a film about how the film industry is being opened up, featuring Sorvino, Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig, Dee Rees, Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Jenkins and Geena Davis.

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south. The centre-left coalition, dominated by the Democratic Party, was punished in traditional strongholds including Emilia-Romagna, the northern region home to the city of Bologna. Voter turnout was estimated at 73% on Monday morning, according to interior ministry figures. Though no party will be able to rule alone based on latest results, the surge of support for populist parties has been compared with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. The right-wing alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy, is tipped to get 248-268 seats - below the 316 needed for a majority. But Five Star will emerge as the largest single party in Italy's lower house, with 216-236 seats. The party was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian election: Its economy in charts Immigration dominates Italian election Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Italian voters appear to have abandoned Mr Renzi's Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is projected to come a distant third, with an estimated 107-127 seats. Immigration and the economy have been two of the key issues for voters during the election. More than 600,000 migrants have travelled from Libya to reach Italy since 2013, which has upset many Italians. The state of the economy was also at the centre of the debates. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate, the upper house of parliament, also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was forecast to take the most seats - around 102-122 - but miss out on a majority. The right-wing coalition is predicted to get 118-150 seats in the upper house, and the Democratic Party 42-54. By James Reynolds BBC News, Milan We still don't know who the winner will be. But in this opening act, Five Star has gained a certain advantage. Its message clearly resonated with young people searching for jobs, and with voters in the poorer south of the country. Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party is among the losers in this election The movement made a big point of running alone in this election. By contrast, other major parties teamed up into electoral alliances. But the feature which gave the party its strength - its independence - may now become its weakness. In order to form a government, Five Star must find coalition partners. Its inexperience in working with others may be a disadvantage in the practical business of coalition-building. So, which way will Five Star seek to turn? There is some speculation that the movement may seek a coalition with the League. Both parties have criticised Italy's relationship with the European Union, although neither campaigns to leave the bloc. A potential alliance between the two would be viewed with some degree of worry in Brussels. The vote comes as a blow to Silvio Berlusconi, 81, whose party led the right-wing coalition. But now Matteo Salvini has laid claim to that role. He has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and spoken of the ""danger"" of Islam. ""My first words: THANK YOU,"" tweeted Mr Salvini as projections rolled in. In any case Mr Berlusconi cannot hold public office himself until next year because of a tax fraud conviction. This video can not be played From 2018: Berlusconi's handshake advice for BBC reporter The leader of the League is a proud Eurosceptic, who has praised Brexit and voiced opposition to the euro in the past. ""It's a fantastic victory which fills us with pride,"" said Mr Salvini on Monday as results came in. He claimed Italian voters had ""made a step forward to be free from the cages and ties that are bringing back hunger and insecurity in Europe"". In the same speech, Mr Salvini repeated his stance that the euro is bad for Italy. ""It's a wrong currency and a wrong choice,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" Homes across the UK are facing water supply problems - with thousands of people in Wales and south-east England urged to use as little as possible. Water suppliers say a thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks. About 13,000 homes are still without water in Kent and Sussex while thousands of properties in Wales and 5,000 homes in London also have no supply. The industry regulator Ofwat has said water firms,externalhave ""fallen well short"". Suppliers across the country say teams are working to fix damaged pipes that have left customers with no supply or low pressure. Water companies said cracks and splits had been caused by the freeze which are now being exposed as the pipes thaw. Parts of the Midlands, south-west England and Scotland are also affected. West Midlands-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has agreed to stop production to preserve the water supply for homes, hospitals and schools. Chocolate maker Cadbury also sent workers home from its Bournville plant but said it was able to continue some limited production. In south-east England and Birmingham, suppliers say they have been identifying vulnerable customers and providing them with bottled water. Thames Water have been handing out bottles of water Thames Water said on Monday 10,000 homes in SW16 and NW3 postcodes in London have no water At its peak, more than 20,000 homes in south and north London were left without water on Sunday. Supplier Thames Water said the number of homes affected was constantly falling and was down to about 5,000 by Monday evening. The company said it was taking longer than expected to restore supplies to homes in the SW12, SW15 SW16 and SW17 postcodes. It said households in NW2, NW3, NW5, NW11, N2, N6, N10 and N19 may still be facing low pressure but staff were working in those areas. The company says it distributed almost a million litres of water across the weekend and was continuing to offer to supplies to households in the affected areas of London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that thousands of homes in the capital still lacked water. Several schools in London and Kent were closed on Monday because they were unable to guarantee running water. South East Water set up a number of bottled water stations in Sussex and Kent where 13,000 homes had been affected. Southern Water, which had urged customers to ""only use the water you absolutely must"", said it was restoring the supply to 5,000 homes in Sittingbourne, Kent but there were still 900 homes without water in Hastings and interruptions to supplies in the Crawley area. Severn Trent said it had seen a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes compared with a typical day Work is under way to repair pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw In Wales,about 3,500 customers are without water, Welsh Water said. Thousands of customersare also without water in parts of Birmingham, the West Midlands and Staffordshire. Yorkshire Water, United Utilities, Affinity Water, Anglian Water and Bristol Water also reported problems. Severn Trent, which said it had seen an increase in reports of burst pipes, thanked Coventry-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover for agreeing to stop production ""to help us target our supply"". South West Water said it has an ""unprecedented number of burst water mains"" and warned some customers in Devon and Cornwall that, although water can be used, there is a ""noticeable taste"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May on housing (and Brexit) Young people without family wealth are ""right to be angry"" at not being able to buy a home, Theresa May has said. Announcing reforms to planning rules in England, the PM said home ownership was largely unaffordable to those not backed by ""the bank of mum and dad"". This disparity was entrenching social inequality and ""exacerbating divisions between generations"", she said. Labour said Mrs May, who has housing as a key priority, should be embarrassed by the ""feeble"" measures proposed. Should baby boomers' wealth be more heavily taxed? Your biggest financial decision - in charts Where can I afford to live? Does England need 300,000 new homes a year? ""This housing crisis is made in Downing Street,"" said shadow housing minister John Healey. ""It's time the Tories changed course, and backed Labour's long-term plan to build the genuinely affordable homes."" In her speech to the National Planning Conference. Mrs May said the existingNational Planning Policy Framework will be overhauled,external, pending a consultation, with up to 80 proposals first put forward last year being implemented. The key measures are: 10% of homes on major sites should be available for affordable home ownership Builders to be more open about affordable housing commitments at planning stage Councils will have to adopt a new nationwide standard showing housing need in their areas Infrastructure needs to be considered at pre-planning stage Councils to consider revoking planning permission after two years if building has not started Ancient Woodland and aged trees to get specific protection A separate review, due to be concluded later this year, will look at creating a new automatic right for homeowners to extend upwards and to make it easier to develop agricultural land for housing. Mrs May said the cost of housing, both for ownership and rent, was reinforcing economic divisions and leading to growing social immobility, with public sector workers unable to take jobs in certain parts of the country. This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this ""The result is a vicious circle from which most people can only escape with help from the bank of mum and dad,"" she said. ""Talking to voters during last year's election campaign, it was clear that many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this. ""Angry that, regardless of how hard they work, they won't be able to buy a place of their own. Angry when they're forced to hand more and more of their wages to a landlord to whom their home is simply a business asset. ""They're right to be angry."" Although the number of planning permissions being granted in England has risen since 2010, the PM said this has not been matched by a corresponding rise in the number of homes being built. She pointed the finger of blame partly at developers who she said have a ""perverse"" financial incentive to hoard land once it had been approved for development rather than actually build on it. She criticised bonuses for construction bosses which are ""based not on the number of homes they build but on their profits or share price"". ""In a market where lower supply equals higher prices, that creates a perverse incentive, one that does not encourage them to build the homes we need,"" she said. Labour wants action to address what it says is a 30-year low in home ownership Housing is a big issue and the government clearly knows it. Theresa May admitted that the election campaign had showed her ""many people, particularly younger people, are angry about this."" So who's fault is it that rents are unaffordable, that accommodation is poor, that home ownership for many is completely out of reach? The prime minister pointed the finger at developers who ""game the system"". Her housing secretary blamed councils for ""nimbyist attitudes"". But both said, too, that there was no ""silver bullet"". When voters get angry though, they will look for someone to blame. Which is why the government is at pains to show it is taking the housing problem seriously. It may take more than a reminder of promises already made and an overhaul of planning guidelines to convince people of that. So expect to see Theresa May in a high visibility vest again before long. There was an outcry last year after Persimmon announced that 140 staff would share a bonus pool of Â£500m and that its chief executive was in line for a payout of Â£110m, a figure that has since been reduced by Â£25m. While the firm defended the payouts, saying they were a reward for success, critics say the tripling of the firm's share price since 2013 was in part due to government subsidies for new homes via the Help to Buy Scheme. Why can't the UK build 240,000 houses a year? ""I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise,"" she said. ""I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs."" Mrs May insisted that ""tearing up"" the Green Belt was not the answer to the UK's housing crisis and that existing protections would be maintained and, in some cases, strengthened. This video can not be played Nick Boles set out what he thought Theresa May's housing speech was lacking Councils will only be able to amend Green Belt boundaries if they can prove they have fully explored every other reasonable option for building the homes their community needs. The Local Government Association said it was wrong to blame councils as they were approving nine out of ten proposed developments and yet more than 420,000 homes with permission were still waiting to be built. ""No-one can live in a planning permission,"" said its chair Lord Porter. ""Developers need to get on with building affordable homes with the needed infrastructure and councils need greater powers to act where housebuilding has stalled."" This video can not be played CPRE suggests building more new homes in northern England The Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said the PM was only ""tinkering at the edges"" of what was needed to boost the supply of new homes and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the ""speech overlooked entirely the role central government must play... private developers and local authorities cannot do this alone"". Housing charity Shelter said Mrs May was right to close ""loopholes"" being used by developers to reduce affordable housing levels. The Resolution Foundation welcomed the call for local government and housebuilding firms to do more, but also said the government needed to do more and said it was now ""time for action, not just discussion"" on private renting In her speech the PM also said homelessness was a ""source of national shame"" and Â£1bn was being spent to halve rough sleeping. Housing policy is devolved in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish government has pledged to build 50,000 new affordable homes by 2021 whilethe Welsh government launched two schemeslast week designed to help more people onto the housing ladder.

In a letter to a local newspaper sent from prison, Romano labelled the students ""courageous and inspiring"". Since the shooting, many of the survivors have lobbied for change. After 17 were killed at their school, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have publicly lobbied lawmakers for policy change.They have organised a march on Washington that will take place later this month. One teacher was injured when Jon Romano opened fire on 9 Feb 2004 at Columbia High School in Greenbush, New York. He was convicted of attempted murder and reckless endangerment after the incident. Four key dates that shaped the US gun debate One mother, two school shootings #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control US students say 'Never Again' after Florida Romano, now 30, was responding to an interview in the Times Union newspaper with his former principal, John Sawchuk.

In the piece, Mr Sawchuk had said that he believed that ""a lot of people would have been dead"" if Romano had an AR-15,externalor another semi-automatic weapon on the day of the shooting. That weapon has been used in several high profile US mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School and in the Florida school attack. Gun control advocates are calling for outlawing assault-style rifles from commercial sale. This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Writing from Coxsackie Correctional Facility, Romano labelled the principal who thwarted the shooting as ""a hero who I owe my life to."" ""I believe the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland are courageous and inspiring for demanding action from politicians,"" Romano wrote. Is it time for US teachers to be armed? Why are mass shootings getting more deadly? Student survivors from the school have already lobbied at the state capital in Tallahassee In the aftermath of the 14 February shooting, pressure has mounted on US politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms including Hertz car rental, United airlines and Delta airlines have ended discounts to NRA members. The organisation has said it will not back any gun ban, and has blamed the failure of authorities to intervene and not the availability of weapons for the shooting. President Donald Trump has come out in support of some limited control measures, and accused lawmakers of being ""petrified"" of lobbyists.

"Jimmy Kimmel joked that Oscar ""keeps his hands where you can see them"" Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel aimed barbs at Harvey Weinstein at the first Academy Awards sinceHollywood's sexual harassment scandal,externalunfolded. Openingthe Oscars,external, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. ""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most."" But unlike at the Baftas and Golden Globes, where stars wore black as a show of defiance and solidarity, there was no such dress code at the Oscars. The Oscars ceremony as it happened The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand rule the Oscars Weinstein statue appears in Hollywood ahead of Oscars Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? Weinstein is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and sexual harassment. The Oscar-winning producer has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex against him. Near the start of his opening monologue, Kimmel joked about the reputation of men in Hollywood. Pointing at a life-sized Oscars statuette, he said: ""Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood, and there's a very good reason why. Just look at him. ""Keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word, and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations, and that's the kind of men we need more of in this town."" Salma Hayek said ""future generations will have it easier"" The US talk show host said the downfall of Weinstein, and the reforms that had begun since, had not come soon enough. ""What happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was long overdue,"" he said. ""We can't let bad behaviour slide any more. The world is watching us."" Kimmel attempted to balance gravity with humour in his remarks about how Hollywood was attempting to put its house in order. ""We need to set an example and the truth is if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go,"" he said.

Referring to The Shape of Water, in which a cleaning lady falls in love with a mysterious river creature, Kimmel joked: ""We will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly that women started dating fish."" Weinstein has been one of the dominant figures at the Oscars over the past two decades, producing winning films like Shakespeare in Love and The King's Speech. He may not have been at this year's ceremony, but some of his accusers were. Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino - two of Weinstein's accusers - arrived together They included Salma Hayek, who said on the red carpet: ""Here we are to celebrate the fact that women will not have to struggle as hard together. I know that future generations will have it easier."" Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd, who were among the first to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, sent an optimistic message as they spoke to US TV network ABC. Judd said women's voices had been ""squelched"" in the past, but that they were emerging as ""phoenixes"". ""What's so spectacular about this moment is that finally the world is able to hear,"" she said. ""Those of us who have come forward were often then disbelieved, minimised, shamed, and so much of the movement is about putting that shame back where it belongs, which is with the perpetrator."" Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek spoke about Time's Up Sorvino said: ""I want people to know that this movement isn't stopping. We're going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women... ""We want to take our activism and our power into action and change things for every woman everywhere working in any workplace."" They were supporting the Time's Up movement, which has raised $21m (Â£15.2m) to fund legal support for victims of sexual misconduct in all walks of life. Although there was no all-black dress code, some guests did wear Time's Up badges in support of the campaign. Judd, Hayek and another of accuser, Annabella Sciorra, later appeared on stage in a segment about Time's Up. They introduced a film about how the film industry is being opened up, featuring Sorvino, Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig, Dee Rees, Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Jenkins and Geena Davis. They talked about inequality, inclusion and diversity. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"The clear-up continues following the heavy snow falls across Scotland last week Scottish ministers are considering action against employers for docking the wages of staff who could not make it to work because of the bad weather. The public was advised not to travel during the worst of the snow last week. Scottish Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he had been contacted by people who were facing disciplinary action or potential docking of wages. He told the BBC that was not acceptable and he would look at the legal position. Disruption continues as thaw begins In pictures: UK battles snow Snow storms 'cost economy Â£200m-Â£300m' It's snowing - can I refuse to go to work? His comments come as icy roads and snow continue to cause disruption in parts of the UK but forecasters say temperatures are starting to rise. Weather warnings for snow and ice are in place for parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. Many rail services are still affected while three flood warnings are in place.

""Armies"" of local people have helped clear roads across Scotland, including in the village of Blanefield The west coast mainline reopened between Scotland and Carlisle on Sunday evening. ScotRail earlier said it had a ""near-normal service"" running across the country. Many rural communities in south-west England which had been cut off by poor conditions can now be reached. On Wednesday into Thursday, Scotland ground to a halt witha red weather warning in place and people told not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Yousaf said: ""I'd be extremely, extremely disappointed if employers chose to dock wages for somebody because they couldn't travel during the red weather warning.""

He added: ""Now that's just simply not an acceptable situation, when the government and the police and other agencies joined together to give very crisp, very clear advice."" Asked what action Mr Yousaf might take against employers, he responded: ""I don't know the legal position, but it will clearly be part of the debrief that we have after we pass through the yellow weather warning, which is late Monday night."" The minister said the process would involve ""talking to employers and having that dialogue with them, and internally looking at what powers we have is clearly part of the discussion we're going to have"".

Meanwhile, the Met Office currently has two yellow severe weather warnings in place, including for snow and ice across a large area of central and eastern Scotland until Monday night. A second warning for ice in parts of north-east England and Northern Ireland is in force until 11:00 GMT on Monday. The Met Office has also issued a third yellow warning of snow and ice for Tuesday covering northern Scotland. The three flood warnings are in coastal parts of south-west and north-east England and are because of high tides, rather than thawing snow. ScotRail said on Sunday morning: ""A massive thank you to everyone at the ScotRail Alliance that worked tirelessly day and night to get Scotland's railway back up and running."" Virgin Trains reopened its line between Carlisle and Scotland on the west coast main line with  limited rail services. It is also offering replacement coaches. The railways are facing a challenge to clear snow On the east coast route, Virgin said it hoped to run a ""near-normal Sunday timetable"" but passengers were urged to travel only if necessary as trains would be busy. On Saturday,communities answered a call from the Scottish government to work togetherto clear local areas. Snow clearing at South Morningside Primary in Edinburgh ""Armies"" of parent volunteers have been mobilised to try to get schools ready for Monday morning. Many schools contacted parents via social media asking for help to clear paths and playgrounds to make them safe for pupils to return. Hundreds of thousands of children have not been in the classroom since Tuesday due to extreme weather. Parents and teachers have already been working to clean up snow from school grounds to allow them to reopen on Monday. Other schools posted appeals for volunteers to gather at specific times to get grounds cleared. Most councils who were forced to close schools last week were aiming to reopen facilities after the weekend, weather depending. The Scottish government has also openedthe Bellwin Scheme,set up to help councils who face large costs from damage due to the severe weather.

"Cardinal George Pell arrives at a court in Melbourne on Monday Cardinal George Pell has returned to an Australian court for a hearing that will determine whether he stands trial on sexual assault charges. The Catholic cleric, 76, has strongly denied what police have described as historical accusations by ""multiple complainants"" in the state of Victoria. He will plead not guilty to all charges, his lawyer said last year. The court hearing in Melbourne is expected to run for a month. Much of it will be closed to the public and media. Cardinal Pell was given a police escort into the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Monday as dozens of media representatives and bystanders watched on. Inside, his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, accused police of investigating the cardinal with a ""presumption of guilt"". Australia's most senior Catholic figure is considered the third-ranking official at the Vatican, where he is in charge of the Church's finances. Last year, Cardinal Pell took a leave of absence from the Vatican to fight the sexual assault charges in Australia. Last June, Victoria Police charged Cardinal Pell with ""multiple"" sexual offence charges involving ""multiple complainants"". Authorities described the accusations as historical, but did not give further details. On Friday, prosecutors dropped one charge. Last year, Cardinal Pell said: ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me."" About 50 witnesses are expected to give evidence at the month-long hearing In a hearing in October, Cardinal Pell's barrister, Robert Richter QC, said he intended to prove that ""what was alleged was impossible"". During a 25-minute administrative hearing, Mr Richter argued that Victoria Police had not followed correct procedure in their investigation. ""We say that was not followed because there was a presumption of guilt,"" he said. He also accused police of not properly investigating witness statements that had been provided by the defence. The court was later closed to the public for witnesses to give evidence, as required by state law in sexual offence cases. As many as 50 witnesses are expected to testify in closed sessions for up to two weeks. The committal hearing is likely to run for four weeks in total, local media said. The first witnesses were expected to give testimony via video link late on Monday. At the end of committal hearing, Magistrate Belinda Wallington will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to proceed to a trial in the County Court of Victoria. The cardinal may then be required to enter a plea.

"This video can not be played World Indoor Athletics: GB's Andrew Pozzi wins 60m hurdles gold in photo finish Great Britain's Andrew Pozzi secured men's 60m hurdles gold by one-hundredth of a second at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Birmingham. The 25-year-old has shared team captain duties with Shelayna Oskan-Clarke at the event and his win arrived shortly after she claimed women's 800m bronze. Pozzi's 7.46 seconds just edged out American Jarret Eaton (7.47). Britain won another bronze in the women's 4x400m relay after Jamaica were disqualified. The British quartet of Amy Allcock, Hannah Williams, Meghan Beesley and Zoey Clark were initially elevated from fourth to third, before being disqualified themselves for obstruction, only to be reinstated on appeal. The decision means Britain end the championships with seven medals - Pozzi and pentathlon winner Katarina Johnson-Thompson the only athletes to win gold. There was no doubt about Oskan-Clarke's podium finish as she rallied from fifth to third in the closing 200 metres while Pozzi also fought back having clattered an early hurdle. Pozzi and Eaton shook hands as they stared at the arena's big screen when waiting for clarity on who had won. Roars met the result, as the Briton took the title having come from behind late on following Eaton's rapid start, with France's Aurel Manga third (7.54). ""My heart stopped at the end there,"" Pozzi told BBC Sport. ""I knew the fifth hurdle I was behind. I can't describe how much I wanted it. ""I was throwing my body at the line. To be voted co-captain for the championships is the biggest honour of my life. Every member of the team has been perfect."" Two-time men's 110m hurdles world champion Colin Jackson on BBC Two Pozzi had a great heat, a wonderful semi-final and now, when the pressure was on, he's won. Even though he made some mistakes, he kept a cool head and hauled himself back into contention. He drove very hard for the line. What a well deserved victory. This video can not be played Shelayna Oskan-Clarke wins World Indoor bronze in 800m Oskan-Clarke, 28, summed up the grit which has epitomised several British performances as a well-timed surge in the final 50 metres of her 800m final earned her a first medal at a global championships. Her time of one minute 59.81 seconds makes her the sixth British woman to break two minutes indoors. Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba won in 1:58.31, ahead of American Ajee Wilson (1:58.99), the pair resuming their rivalry from the outdoor World Championships in 2017 where they won silver and bronze respectively in London. ""At the start it was nerve-wracking as I had to do my speech and I wanted to inspire the team,"" co-captain Oskan-Clarke told BBC Sport. ""Now it's congratulating them, making them know I'm aware of their performances and that's not too draining. ""I'm happy. It wasn't the best race. It was a bit out of control for the first part of it but I just had to dig deep and catch them at the end. ""The crowd noise was so incredible and loud. You can't not hear it and it helped me dig that bit deeper."" Women's marathon world record holder and BBC Sport commentator Paula Radcliffe Oskan-Clarke judged this perfectly. She was only just starting late on and the noise of the crowd must have given her a boost. Once you start to reel someone in and you see they are tired, it's a huge confidence boost. She didn't panic at all when the leaders went ahead. At one point it looked like she was more to the back of the field but she kept her composure. This video can not be played GB promoted to bronze, then disqualified, then get medal back The final Great Britain medal of the championships arrived amid confusing scenes as Allcock, Williams, Beesley and Clark were handed 4x400m bronze shortly before the championships ended. Jamaica, who finished second, were disqualified when an athlete waiting for the baton was ruled to have been stood in an incorrect position. BBC Sport analyst Michael Johnson said the decision was fair but moments later, Great Britain were also thrown out. That gave bronze to Ukraine until almost two hours after the final, when Britain were reinstated. It was the latest controversy in a championship which featured 21 disqualifications, most of which were for lane infringements. The American four - brought home by 400m gold medallist Courtney Okolo - were untouchable in setting a championship record, finishing half a second off the world record in three minutes 23.85 seconds. In the men's 4x400m final, Poland set a world indoor record of three minutes 01.77 seconds, edging out the USA into silver (3:01.97). Great Britain's 4x400m relay team Amy Allcock, Hannah Williams, Meghan Beesley and Zoey Clark were briefly elevated into bronze medal position Eight-time world champion Michael Johnson on BBC Two I believe the IAAF will have to do something about this. The problem will continue with lane infringements. This was on an absurd level. If you step on the line one time, you don't get much advantage. When it amounts to this number of disqualifications and confusion, I think fans get to a point where they zone out, thinking they don't know who won. That's no fun for the fans.

"Italy goes to the polls on Sunday in one of its most contentious votes in years. The economy has become a key battleground for the main parties' campaigns. Italy's economy has started to expand once again, but is still one of the worst performers of the countries in the eurozone. The election battle is proving to be very close, with the latest polls suggesting no political coalition will win a clear majority. Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters The parties are battling to prove they can take Italy's economy, industry and job market back to pre-crisis levels. However, despite all the pre-election rhetoric, few Italians can really see what has improved since the economic crisis. The road to full recovery has been much harder than many expected. Economic growth - in terms of GDP per head - has been picking up since 2014. However, the pace of growth appears weak compared with other major European economies. Forecasts suggest it would take between five and six years to achieve the rates seen in 2007. Meanwhile some other eurozone nations are experiencing their best growth in the past decade. Italian debt is now the second worst in Europe after Greece and has reached 132% of GDP. In the field of fashion, food and cars, Italy has had a reputation for excellence and it has exported these all over the world. The ""Made in Italy"" brand has been rejuvenated thanks to an increase in exports and international interest. In 2014, Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party started its job reforms, which have been credited with  creating almost one million jobs. However, the latest Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) figures show that nearly 60% of them are part-time roles. The level of part-time work means much lower job security compared with other European countries. In Italy, this seems to have deepened the problem of unemployment - particularly in the southern regions where jobless rates are as high as 29%. Although Italy presents itself as one of the top three European economies, high rates of unemployment have caused a steep rise in poverty. The number of Italians at risk of poverty rose from three million in 2006 to 18 million - nearly a third of the entire population - in 2016. The top rate of income tax in Italy is one of the highest in Europe, well above the 39% average for top rates across the 28-members of the Union. That's why Silvio Berlusconi has started his own personal battle against high taxation levels and has promised to create a 23% ""Flat Tax"" for everyone Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Immigration dominates Italian election Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"The widow of one of the troops killed later became embroiled in a row with US President Donald Trump The Islamic State (IS) group has published a video purporting to show an ambush in Niger in which four US soldiers were killed last October. It is not clear why the release of the video - via an IS outlet on messaging app Telegram - was delayed until now. The video consists mainly of raw footage, including images apparently filmed using a helmet camera belonging to one of the soldiers. The video seems to suggest that the attack was carried out by IS militants. The deaths became a major political row in the USwhen the widow of one of the soldiers, Army Sgt La David Johnson, said President Donald Trump had made her cry during a condolence phone call by suggesting her husband ""knew what he signed up for"". The president later called a US congresswoman's account of the phone call ""totally fabricated"". The propaganda film begins with still images showing an alleged pledge of allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by members of the Sahel-based group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM was formed from a number of West African jihadist groups in March 2017, and originally had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. This alleged switch to IS was reported last month by a number of analysts, but it had not been promoted by IS outlets on social media. How IS wages its social media war Apple removes Telegram from app store The graphic video shows several armed militants walking and running in a desert area, apparently heading for the ambush, reports BBC Monitoring. The soldiers are seen driving away in a white vehicle, with coloured smoke grenades providing cover. After a cut in the video, the US soldiers are seen around another vehicle, with one soldier driving and the other two walking beside while seemingly firing at their attackers.

"President Kiska accused senior officials of an ""arrogance of power"" Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska has called for a radical government reshuffle or new elections to rebuild public trust after the murder of a journalist and his fiancÃ©e. But Prime Minister Robert Fico disagreed, accusing the president of ""dancing on the graves"" of the victims. The killing of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova sparked protests in Slovakia. Kuciak, 27, had been investigating alleged political corruption linked to Italian organised crime. He was shot dead before he had finished the article, but it was published posthumously. Journalistâs final story rocks Slovakia Slovakia murder suspects released All of the seven people arrested in connection with the murders were released on Saturday because no evidence had emerged during the 48 hours they could be legally detained, police said. One of the men released is an Italian who had done business deals with officials close to Mr Fico. Last week, Maria Troskova, the prime minister's chief state adviser, and Viliam Jasan, the secretary of the state security council, resigned amid allegations about past dealings with him. In a joint statement, the pair denied wrongdoing. They said they were stepping down for the duration of the investigation so their names could not be used in a political battle against Mr Fico. Jan Kuciak's funeral was held on Saturday Mr Kiska called for a ""radical reconstruction"" of the government, but Mr Fico said this would undermine the results of the 2016 elections. The president, who does not have formal powers to dissolve the government, accused senior officials of an ""arrogance of power"", and bemoaned a lack of action on the part of the government to restore public trust and defuse tensions after the killings last weekend. He said he would meet political parties to find a way out. Mr Fico said any government changes would have to be agreed by his Smer party's two coalition partners, adding: ""In this process, the constitution does not recognise any role of the president."" He added: ""Our goal is the investigation of this brutal act. We won't dance on the graves of two young people, unlike opposition, media and, now, the president."" Kuciak had been investigating the presence of the Italian mafia in eastern Slovakia The Slovak National Party, a junior government member, said it was ready to talk to the president. The other party in the coalition, Most-Hid, wants the interior minister to resign by 12 March. Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004. In his investigation, Kuciak alleged that Italian businessmen with ties to the feared Calabrian organised crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta had settled in eastern Slovakia, and spent years embezzling EU funds for this relatively poor region on the border with Ukraine.
