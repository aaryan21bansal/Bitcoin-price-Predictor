"Stormont has been without a devolved government since January 2017 It is understood the British and Irish governments are planning to set up fresh talks to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are likely to make an announcement on Friday. The plan would see new talks taking place after the council elections in Northern Ireland on 2 May. It follows the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry last week. Standing ovation as priest challenges politicians Lyra McKee: What's next for NI? NI Secretary to hold talks with party leaders Ms McKee, 29, was shot last Thursday while observing rioting in Derry, andhundreds of mourners attended her funeral on Wednesday. Lyra McKee was shot dead last week Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were among the congregation at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI Secretary of State Karen Bradley had already said she planned to hold talks about Stormont after the local government elections next Thursday. But several parties wrote urging her to convene discussions urgently in the wake of the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. It is understood there were intensive discussions in Belfast after Wednesday's funeral which was attended by leading politicians from Northern Ireland, the Republic and Westminster. The Secretary of State and the TÃ¡naiste are expected to make an announcement in Belfast on Friday afternoon. But convening talks is one thing. Concluding them successfully with many outstanding issues between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, not to mention, Brexit is another. Priest Fr Martin Magill received a standing ovation when he asked why it had taken her death to unite political parties. Ms McKee's murder has prompted calls for Stormont's politicians to resolve their differences, as Northern Ireland hasbeen without a functioning devolved government since January 2017. This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Mrs Bradley had previously said she intends to hold discussions with Stormont's party leaders this week in a bid to restore power-sharing. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state's ""priority remains restoring devolution at the earliest opportunity"". DUP leader Arlene Foster, who held talks with Mrs Bradley and Mr Coveney on Wednesday, said she wanted to see the government ""take steps"" to ensure talks commence. She added that the DUP wanted to see the Northern Ireland Assembly restored immediately, alongside a time-limited process dealing with outstanding issues. The DUP suggested this as a way of breaking the deadlock back in September 2017, but at the time it was rejected by Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""ready to play our full part in a serious and meaningful talks process which removes obstacles to power-sharing, delivers rights and restores the assembly"". ""Sinn FÃ©in wants to see the full restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,"" she added. What now for Stormont after McKee murder?

"This video can not be played The actor says the makers of the 25th Bond film will reflect changing attitudes. Oscar-winning actor Rami Malek is to play a villain in the 25th official James Bond film - but the movie still does not have a title. The cast and creative team have been unveiled at a launch event in Jamaica, with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge confirmed as one of the writers. The unnamed film, which will be released next April, will be Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as 007. Malek won an Oscar for playing singer Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Rami Malek won an Oscar for playing Freddie Mercury Phoebe Waller-Bridge was responsible for the first series of Killing Eve The official plot summary mentions ""a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology"". Details of Malek's character haven't been revealed and he wasn't at the official launch on Thursday, but he sent a video message confirming he will play a villain. ""I'm stuck here in New York in production but I'm very much looking forward to joining the whole cast and crew,"" said the Egyptian-American actor, who is currently filming TV show Mr Robot. ""I will be making sure Mr Bond does not have an easy ride in this, his 25th outing. See you all soon."" After watching that, Craig joked that he was ""scared"" about what lay in store for Ian Fleming's suave secret agent. Left-right: Lea Seydoux, Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris and Lashana Lynch at the Bond 25 launch Bond will again be called upon to save the world from a shadowy adversary - all in a day's work for 007. The official plot summary reads: ""Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. ""The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology."" At the launch, producer Barbara Broccoli said Bond's attitudes to women would move with the times. ""The Me Too movement has had a huge impact - rightfully, thankfully - on society, and these films should reflect that, as everything we do should,"" she said. Craig told BBC News: ""Bond has always adapted for the times. But you're dealing with a character who is flawed, who has issues, and I think that's something that's worth still exploring and grappling with. ""Of course, we wouldn't be movie-makers or creative people if we didn't have an eye on what was going on in the outside world."" Lea Seydoux appeared with Daniel Craig in 2015's Spectre It was also confirmed thatRalph FiennesandBen Whishawwill return as M and Q respectively, withNaomie Harriscoming back as Moneypenny andRory Kinnearagain playing MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner.

Cuban rising starAna de Armaswas Joi in Blade Runner 2049 and will be seen opposite Daniel Craig in another film, Knives Out, in November. This is the first major film for French newcomerDali Benssalah, who studied economics and trained as a Thai boxer before turning to acting. Swedish-Danish actorDavid Dencikis best known for roles in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Top of the Lake: China Girl. Writer and actress Waller-Bridge, who was also behind the first series of Killing Eve, is just the second female writer in Bond history - after Johanna Harwood, who worked on Dr No and From Russia With Love. Barbara Broccoli said: ""Daniel [Craig] suggested Phoebe, who we all love, so we leapt at the opportunity and she's been amazing, doing great work."" The other co-writers on Bond 25 are seasoned Bond scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade along with Scott Z Burns, whose credits include 2007's The Bourne Ultimatum. The film is being directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, whose credits include the first series of HBO's True Detective andNetflix's Maniac.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has smashed into Mozambique, flattening thousands of homes and flooding low-lying areas. Cyclone Kenneth struck with winds of 220km/h (140mph) barely a month after a previous cyclone killed hundreds and devastated large areas. Heavy rain continued to fall on Friday, raising fears of more floods. Authorities have advised people to move to higher ground amid concern that thousands may be trapped in remote villages. Mozambique was still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 900 people across three countries in March. Cyclone Kenneth had already killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. At least one person has been reported dead in Mozambique after being crushed by a falling tree. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth. It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather. Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over coming days. Aid agencies say they are concerned about communities prone to flooding and landslides. The level of expected rainfall is nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that caused devastating flooding in the port city of Beira, further south, during Cyclone Idai. The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups. Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas, and reports from northern Mozambique said many homes had collapsed and the provincial capital of Pemba had lost its power supply. Kenneth made landfall on Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Communications with the affected areas were disrupted, obscuring the full extent of the damage. Thousands remain away from their homes after compulsory evacuation procedures were put in place by authorities. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, which battered the islands with high winds and heavy rains. The winds have caused widespread power outages and damage to homes. In some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close. Cyclone Kenneth has already devastated areas of the island nation of Comoros Residents in the southern Tanzanian town of Mtwara were earlier told to seek higher ground and shelter, but that warning was stood down. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shared images of the damage on social media. In a tweet, the group confirmed it had volunteers on the ground assisting communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The presenter said he was ""not here to make friends"" but to ""make a difference"" TV naturalist Chris Packham has condemned the hanging of dead crows outside his home in the New Forest as ""ghastly"". It comes as the licensed shooting of crows has been halted after a challenge by his Wild Justice campaign group. Natural England has revoked licences for controlling 16 species of bird, including several types of crow. Mr Packham posted a picture of the crows on social media and said opponents were ""lashing out"". What is believed to be his address has also appeared in an online post urging people to dump dead lambs at his property. Mr Packham said: ""All it does is strengthen my resolve to make the UK countryside a better place for wildlife and the people who live and work there. ""In a very sad and perverse way this ghastly action indicates that I'm making progress. ""As I've always said 'I'm not here to make friends - I'm here to make a difference'."" A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman confirmed a report of criminal damage has been made with the incident believed to have taken place between 20:00 on Wednesday and 06:50 BST on Thursday. Wild Justice was set up by Mr Packham and other campaigners to take legal cases on behalf of wildlife against public bodies. In February it challenged the general licences that allow farmers to shoot birds including wood pigeons, jackdaws and magpies that damage crops or attack livestock. Allow Twitter content?

A statement said: ""We haven't changed the law, we have merely shown that the current system of licensing of killing of certain species of birds, developed and administered by a statutory wildlife agency, is unlawful now and presumably has been for decades."" Natural England said it revoked three licences for controlling certain wild birds following the challenge and was working on ""alternative measures"" that would allow lawful control of the bird species to continue where necessary. The move provoked a backlash from farmers groups and others. A Change.org petition calling on the BBC to ""sack Chris Packham"" has received more than 85,000 signatures. But a counter petition has since been set up opposing any potential sacking, saying ""as a journalist [he] should be allowed to use his platform to inform everyone the reality of our dying planet"".

"The attack happened in Church Road in Rayleigh on Wednesday evening An off-duty police officer is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in a ""targeted"" attack. The victim suffered injuries to his stomach, chest and arm in the attack in Rayleigh at about 21:15 BST on Wednesday, Essex Police said. A man was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is in custody. Police said it was believed the attack was ""targeted and isolated"" and have appealed for witnesses. In a statement Ben-Julian Harrington, chief constable of Essex, said the force was ""supporting one of our colleagues who was the victim of a stabbing in Rayleigh"". ""I can however confirm we have a man in custody who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder,"" he said. ""We believe this attack was targeted and that the officer and the suspect are known to each other. ""There is no wider risk to the local community or other police officers as a result of this incident."" Police said he was in a ""serious but stable condition"" after undergoing hospital treatment. He had been found at an address in Church Road and it was not seeking anyone else in connection with the stabbing.

Rayleigh and Wickford MP Mark Francois said: ""This is an appalling crime and my thoughts are with the officer concerned and his family. ""Mercifully, while his injuries are serious, I have been told they are no longer life-threatening. ""Nevertheless, attacking a police officer on their own doorstep is absolutely wicked.""

"Amazon has promised to cut delivery times worldwide for customers of its Prime service. Amazon Prime is a subscription service offering free delivery and access to Amazon's TV shows. Members in the US currently receive free two-day delivery, but the plan is to cut that to one day. Prime customers already get free one-day delivery in some parts of the UK. Amazon plans to spend $800m (Â£620m) to cut delivery times elsewhere. It did not say when delivery times would be cut but said it expects to make ""steady progress"" this year. Walmart and Target have been improving their delivery times in the US and offer two-day shipping on many items. Amazon's move is an effort to stay ahead of those rivals. It already ships many items to US cities within a day, but analysts say extended that service to more remote parts of the country will be difficult. ""Amazon is cranking it up a notch, trying to set themselves apart,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, a former UPS analyst who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. ""I don't know how they are going to do it in Little Town USA,"" she said. Amazon also reported a first quarter profit of $3.6bn (Â£2.8bn), double the same period in the previous year. It was its fourth successive quarter of record profit. In the first quarter sales rose 17% to $59.7bn. Amazon expects sales to grow between 13% and 20% in the second quarter. Sales surged at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides computing services to companies over the internet - a service know as cloud computing. Launched in 2002, AWS has become a crucial part of Amazon's business, and sales rose 41% to $7.7bn in the three-month period to the end of March. ""While the cost of building the data-driven infrastructure to support the cloud systems is vast, the fact it requires such deep pockets actually works in Amazon's favour,"" said George Salmon, an analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's difficult to see how a new challenger can wrestle business away from the likes of Amazon, Google, and the latest member of the $1tn club, Microsoft.""

"The new Â£17.6bn railway across London was due to open in December 2018 Crossrail will be completed two years behind schedule, transport bosses have admitted. But the completion between October 2020 and March 2021 will not include the opening of Bond Street, one of 10 new stations along the new Elizabeth Line, they said. London mayor Sadiq Khan described the new timetable as ""realistic and deliverable"". The new Â£17.6bn railway across London was due to open last December. ""Many risks and uncertainties remain in the development and testing of the train and signalling systems,"" Crossrail Ltd said in a statement, having identified a new ""six-month delivery window"" for the project. The line had been rescheduled to open this autumn but that had beencast into doubt after further setbacks were reported. Crossrail said Bond Street's opening had been delayed ""because of design and delivery challenges"" and would be unveiled ""at the earliest opportunity"". Its chief executive Mark Wild told the BBC's Today programme Tottenham Court Road station would be open and he hoped Bond Street station would be opened soon after the Elizabeth Line started operating. ""It's very disappointing we didn't make it in December but we've got a plan now, a clear plan, to get it opened by the end of next year. ""I think the project in the summer of last year got itself into quite a compressed state with overlapping activities."" He added: ""My job now is to get the railway open."" Crossrail 'could be delayed until 2021' TfL boss refuses to quit over Crossrail Lack of accountability over Crossrail delay Crossrail said it had major tasks to complete before opening the line, including creating and testing software that would integrate the train operating system with three different signalling systems. It said it also needed to finish installing equipment in tunnels, test communications, install and test station systems and trial run the trains over many thousands of miles on the completed railway.  Â£14.8bnexpected cost in 2010 Â£17.6bnexpected cost as of 2019 December 2018Original scheduled launch March 2021Current expected completion, without Bond Street 15,000people have worked on Crossrail 60 milesDistance of the line from Reading to Heathrow Mr Khan said the new Crossrail leadership team had worked hard to ""establish a realistic and deliverable schedule for the opening of the project, which TfL and the Department for Transport will now review"". The London Assembly Transport Committee has welcomed the announcement with ""cautionary relief"", its chair Caroline Pidgeon said. However, she also said: ""The project has been pushed back twice already, so the question has to be asked, 'Is the six-month window a hedge-betting exercise to avoid disappointing passengers once more?' ""It is also incredibly frustrating that no senior executives will accept any responsibility for the litany of failures that have led to this delay."" Three emergency cash injections have seen the cost of the project rise from Â£14.8bn to Â£17.6bn.

"""Outdated"" age-specific benefits for older people should be replaced with support for the young to ""deliver a fairer society"", say peers. The Committee on Intergenerational Fairness,externalurged ministers to focus on housing and training, rather than benefits like free TV licences. Committee chair Lord True said failing to rebalance policies could risk the ""strong bond"" between the generations. But campaigners warned against changes, saying pensioner poverty was rising. How housing has divided the young Free TV licence recipients 'richer' Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The committee - made up of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers - issued a raft of recommendations, both to ""retain the supportive relationship between generations"" and to plan for the ""100-year life"" that younger people can expect to become the norm. Suggested improvements include: Ensuring local authorities have specific planning policies to meet the housing needs of younger and older people Increasing training funding for young people who don't go to college or university Making sure those who work for the ""gig"" economy -getting paid per ""gig""- have the same rights as other workers The peers also propose changes to benefits for older people, including: Removing thetriple lock for pensions,which raises the basic state pension by the rate of average earnings increases, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is higher Phasing outfree TV licencesbased on age (currently free for over-75s) and ensuring the government decides on whether to give free licences based on household income Limiting free bus passes for the over-65s and winter fuel payments until five years after retirement age Conservative peer Lord True said: ""Both young and older people recognise the contribution the other makes and the challenges they face. ""However, there is a risk that those connections could be undermined if the government does not get a grip on key issues such as access to housing, secure employment and fairness in tax and benefits."" Life expectancy in the UK is currently 82.9 years for women and 79.2 years for men. But with technological revelations, medical breakthroughs and societal shifts, it is thought that an age expectancy of 100 is not far away. While living a healthy life for longer may appeal, it changes the way governments will need to prepare. The London Business School,externalsays the current life stages of education (between the ages of five and 21), work (22-65) and retirement (65+) will cease to exist. This means people may need to retrain, work for longer or need more care in their later stages of life. As a result, many aspects of the government's remit will be affected, such as housing, health, education and pensions, and the committee says its recommendations will help them get ready. The committee said intergenerational unfairness was being ""exacerbated"" by an ageing population, the 2008 global financial crisis and successive government policies that have failed to consider the issue. According to its report, many pensioner households are now, on average, better off than their working age counterparts, both in terms of income after housing costs and overall household wealth. ""We are calling for some of the outdated benefits based purely on age to be removed,"" said Lord True. He said the universal benefits were ""justified when pensioner households were at the bottom of the income scale, but that is no longer the case"". Allow YouTube content?

However, The Centre for Ageing Better warned against ""tinkering"" with existing benefits, saying pensioner poverty was increasing for the first time in a decade. ""This is not about old versus young,"" said its chief executive, Dr Anna Dixon. ""It is about creating a society where everyone, regardless of income or background, can enjoy every stage of life. ""Headline-grabbing proposals like abolishing free TV licences based on age risk distracting from the big structural changes needed across housing, work and communities."" But David Sinclair, director of the International Longevity Centre, said policymakers had failed the young.

"This video can not be played CCTV captures a high-speed chase towards the M8 motorway Six men have been found guilty of a series of attempted murders in what the High Court heard was a conspiracy of murderous violence. It was carried out by associates of the Lyons criminal family against men associated with their rivals, the Daniel family. They were convicted of attacks over a six-month period from December 2016. The final and most violent assault happened on the approach road to one of Scotland's busiest motorways. The jury was told it was only by good luck or determination that all those who were attacked survived. Peter Bain, Brian Ferguson, Andrew Gallacher and John Hardie were among six men found guilty Brian Ferguson, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 40, Robert Pickett, 53, Andrew Sinclair, 32, John Hardie, 35, and Peter Bain, 45, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. They targeted Robert Daniel, Thomas Bilsland, Gary Petty, Ryan Fitzsimmons and Steven Daniel between June 2016 and September 2017 at locations in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Manchester. Judge Lord Mulholland told them the courts take a dim view of such ""gangsterous conduct"". Police found a haul of weapons in a lock-up garage as part of the police operation A shotgun was among the weapons The judge added: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a warzone with your feud."" He said any suggestion of a ""private"" dispute ""could not be further from the truth"". Lord Mulholland said: ""Be under no illusion what will be coming your way when you return to court."" The men were remanded in custody pending sentencing next month. A Landrover Discovery was found after the attack on Robert Daniel The first target was Robert Daniel, whose car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston on 8 December 2016. Once inside the house he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. Asked in court if he was aware of any ill-feeling between the Daniel and Lyons families, Robert, 29, replied: ""Not that I know of."" A burnt-out BMW was found after an attack on Ryan Fitzsimmons in April 2017 A month later Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. Bilsland, 31, told the jury he was heading to the front door of his mother's home when he was ""hit with something from behind"". He added: ""I kind of fell.. there were three or four guys with masks on. They were round about me. It was all a blur. ""The only thing I was paying attention to was getting to my feet and away. I was in shock, I panicked."" Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull when he was attacked The next victim, Gary Petty, was targeted after he visited an Italian takeaway on 7 March 2017 The court heard he was getting out his Volkswagen Golf when he was struck in Maryhill. He recalled: ""I dropped the food and covered my head to try and protect myself. ""I was just getting hit. I think it was a machete. It all happened so fast."" Gary Petty was attacked as he arrived at his girlfriend's house with a takeaway Former soldier Ryan Fitzsimmons was left unconscious and brain-damaged after being ambushed in the street by a masked gang on 28 April 2017. The 34-year-old was attacked with a sword and a hammer outside the home he shared with his mother in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He told jurors: ""It felt like death was coming."" His mother Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened she suffered a heart attack in the street. An Audi car was used in the attack on Steven Daniel A machete was found in the back of the burnt-out car Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but the court was told he was targeted because his older brother, Martyn, was a convicted criminal who had once been charged with shooting a man called Ross Monaghan, an associate of the accused men. The most savage crime was the assault on Steven ""Bonzo"" Daniel. His Skoda Octavia was first pursued in a high-speed chase which started in Milton and ended up in a crash on an off-ramp of the M8. The relentless attack which followed almost severed his nose from his face and detached his top jaw from his skull. The targeted cleaver and hammer attack on 18 May 2017 left the ex-taxi firm director with facial wounds so severe that first responders initially thought he had been shot. Police later found a car which had been used in the Steven Daniel attack. Steven Daniel was chased in his taxi A tracking device was found under Steven Daniel's car The Audi S3 had been set on fire but a bloodied machete was still in the back seat. But detectives were also interested in the cars driven by the victims because they had been fitted with tracking devices. This led police all the way back to the men in the dock When officers raided their properties they found samurai swords, machetes, false number plates, firearms and baseball bats - though never any baseballs. The prosecution evidence pointed to these attacks being a coordinated vendetta but Steven Daniel, the victim of the most shocking attack, denied that the Daniel family were a serious crime gang. He also denied they were involved in a dispute with the Lyons family and even when asked directly by the judge, Daniel denied he knew of any enemies.

"Mr Lidington is in Glasgow for a major cybersecurity conference Theresa May's deputy has said the Scottish Parliament will not be given the power to hold an independence referendum by 2021. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said there was ""no evidence"" of a surge in support for another vote. And he said the referendum in 2014 had settled matters for a generation. Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday she wants a referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. But the first minister also indicated that Westminster's approval was needed to put the legal status of any vote ""beyond doubt"". She has not yet made a fresh request to the UK government for this to happen, but told BBC Scotland that Mr Lidington was a member of a UK government that is ""clinging to power by its fingertips"" and has ""zero authority or credibility"". Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Ms Sturgeon added: ""I'm not going to spend too much time bothering about the diktats of a government that I expect will be out of office before too long."" And she said the UK government should have to answer ""why they think it is acceptable to block a democratic vote that has a clear mandate in the Scottish Parliament and with the Scottish people"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Downing Street has repeatedly said it does not believe a second referendum should be held - and made clear after Ms Sturgeon's statement on Wednesday that its position has not changed. When asked by BBC Scotland whether this meant the UK government was ruling out granting a Section 30 order - which formed the legal basis for the last referendum - before 2021, Mr Lidington replied: ""Yes. We don't see the case for that. ""This was supposed to be settled for a generation in 2014 and we should stick to that."" He added that there was ""no evidence since then that the appetite of the Scottish people to go through a referendum once again has surged up"". Mr Lidington, who was in Glasgow for a major cybersecurity conference, also said: ""What I pick up whenever I come to Scotland is people saying we want our schools to improve, we want the problems in the hospitals sorted out, we want more jobs, higher living standards and start to get more business investment. ""The UK government wants to work with the Scottish government on those things"". First Minister Alex Salmond and Prime Minister David Cameron signed an agreement that paved the way for the 2014 referendum to be held The first minister hopes a ""framework Bill"" - Scottish Parliament legislation setting the rules for any future referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. In her long-awaited statement to MSPs on Wednesday afternoon, she said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister also predicted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" She announced she wants cross-party talks with opposition leaders about Holyrood's powers, while a Citizens' Assembly will be set up to examine wider questions on Scotland's future. The SNP is holding its party conference at the weekend Ms Sturgeon is due to address the SNP conference in Edinburgh on Sunday, and has been facing calls from some within her party and the wider independence movement for a referendum to be held sooner rather than later - with some also questioning whether a Section 30 order is needed before a referendum is held. Writing in theScotsman newspaper,externalafter Ms Sturgeon's announcement, SNP veteran Kenny MacAskill - the former justice secretary - claimed that independence supporters who now expect an immediate referendum are ""delusional"". He also accused the SNP of ""fiddling while Rome burns"" and argued that Ms Sturgeon's ""heavily caveated"" statement ""confirmed what many have long thought, which is that she's not planning to try for independence before 2021"". However, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that Ms Sturgeon was trying to keep the country's options open in the face of a Westminster government that does ""not give a damn for the people of Scotland"". He also insisted the SNP leader was ""fulfilling the mandate that if Scotland was taken out of the EU against Scotland's will that we would have a right to have a referendum"". Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year.

"Stormont has been without a devolved government since January 2017 It is understood the British and Irish governments are planning to set up fresh talks to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are likely to make an announcement on Friday. The plan would see new talks taking place after the council elections in Northern Ireland on 2 May. It follows the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry last week. Standing ovation as priest challenges politicians Lyra McKee: What's next for NI? NI Secretary to hold talks with party leaders Ms McKee, 29, was shot last Thursday while observing rioting in Derry, andhundreds of mourners attended her funeral on Wednesday. Lyra McKee was shot dead last week Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were among the congregation at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI Secretary of State Karen Bradley had already said she planned to hold talks about Stormont after the local government elections next Thursday. But several parties wrote urging her to convene discussions urgently in the wake of the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. It is understood there were intensive discussions in Belfast after Wednesday's funeral which was attended by leading politicians from Northern Ireland, the Republic and Westminster. The Secretary of State and the TÃ¡naiste are expected to make an announcement in Belfast on Friday afternoon. But convening talks is one thing. Concluding them successfully with many outstanding issues between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, not to mention, Brexit is another. Priest Fr Martin Magill received a standing ovation when he asked why it had taken her death to unite political parties. Ms McKee's murder has prompted calls for Stormont's politicians to resolve their differences, as Northern Ireland hasbeen without a functioning devolved government since January 2017. This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Mrs Bradley had previously said she intends to hold discussions with Stormont's party leaders this week in a bid to restore power-sharing. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state's ""priority remains restoring devolution at the earliest opportunity"". DUP leader Arlene Foster, who held talks with Mrs Bradley and Mr Coveney on Wednesday, said she wanted to see the government ""take steps"" to ensure talks commence. She added that the DUP wanted to see the Northern Ireland Assembly restored immediately, alongside a time-limited process dealing with outstanding issues. The DUP suggested this as a way of breaking the deadlock back in September 2017, but at the time it was rejected by Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""ready to play our full part in a serious and meaningful talks process which removes obstacles to power-sharing, delivers rights and restores the assembly"". ""Sinn FÃ©in wants to see the full restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,"" she added. What now for Stormont after McKee murder?

"This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has declared a presidential bid, putting an end to months of speculation. In a video announcement, Mr Biden argued that the ""core values of the nation... our very democracy, everything that has made America America, is at stake"". The 76-year-old, who has already run twice for the presidency, enters a crowded race for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He is up against 19 other hopefuls. They include Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. Mr Biden, who served as President Barack Obama's deputy for two terms, recalled President Donald Trump's much-criticised remark that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the deadly Charlottesville white nationalist riots of 2017. Which Democrat will take on Trump? Joe Biden, the touchy-feely politician ""With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,"" Mr Biden said. ""I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen."" A spokesman for Mr Obama said selecting Mr Biden as his running mate ""was one of the best decisions he ever made"" and the two had ""forged a special bond"", but the former president notably stopped short of an endorsement. A source familiar with Mr Obama's thinking said the former president believed ""a robust primary in 2007 and 2008 not only made him a better general election candidate, but a better president, too"".

Mr Biden, asked by reporters in Delaware why Mr Obama had not endorsed him, replied: ""I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn't want toâ¦ whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits."" President Trump tweeted: ""Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign."" He is the most experienced of the Democratic candidates. A six-term senator, he ran twice unsuccessfully for president - in 1988 and 2008. Mr Biden was tipped to run for president again in 2016, the year Mr Trump was elected, but ruled himself out after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden, from a brain tumour. He has enjoyed relative popularity among Democrats in recent years, consistently leadingevery national poll of the Democratic primary tracked by the website RealClearPolitics,external. Mr Biden is also betting on having the strongest appeal of the Democratic candidates across America's Midwest, where many low-income voters have abandoned the party in recent years in favour of Mr Trump.

But the former vice-president has been forced to address claims he inappropriately invaded the personal space of women. He apologised, saying: ""The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I understand it and I'll be much more mindful."" Joe Biden enters the Democratic presidential contest as a front-runner, if not the front-runner, with huge name recognition and the potential to raise vast amounts of campaign donations. Of course, so did Hillary Clinton in 2015 - and we all know how that turned out. Like the former secretary of state, Mr Biden in his launch video seems to be defining himself as much by who he isn't - Donald Trump - as what he wants to do. It was an oft-criticised strategy for Mrs Clinton in 2016, and also like Mrs Clinton, his lengthy time in the public eye is likely to be picked apart by opponents. The former vice-president has a lot going for him. He also has a lot going against him. The durability of his campaign is one of the big questions hovering over the Democratic race. Joe Biden: Front-runner but with baggage Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was born on 20 November 1942 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, one of four children in an Irish-Catholic family. In 1972, Mr Biden was elected to the US Senate at the age of 29, and took office a few weeks later when he turned 30 - the minimum age to enter the Senate. Just before he took office, he was devastated by tragedy: his wife Neilia and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash. Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia cutting his 30th birthday cake in November 1972 Mr Biden first ran for the presidency in the 1988 election, buthe withdrew after admitting that he had plagiarised a speech by Neil Kinnock,external, the leader of the Labour Party in the UK at the time. After that bid he spent time rising through the Senate ranks, eventually becoming chairman of the judiciary and foreign relations committees. In 2008 he ran for president again, but failed to gain the political traction he needed and dropped out again. Instead, he joined the Obama ticket.

"Fatema Chowdhury said she was ""desperate"" to speak to someone at the Home Office to ""prove my innocence"" Foreign students accused of cheating on English language tests have told the BBC they have been left in limbo for years - unable to work or use the NHS. The Home Office has cancelled 36,000 student visas since 2014 after cheating was uncovered at test centres. But Labour MP Stephen Timms said many had been falsely accused, and given no opportunity to clear their name. The government said the home secretary has ""listened to the points raised... and has asked for further advice"". The students were required to take the test to extend their studies in the UK beyond their original student visa - which typically lasted from one to three years. They would also have had to complete a separate English language test, usually taken in their home country, before initially being accepted to come to the UK to study. Fatema Chowdhury came to the UK from Bangladesh in 2010 and finished her law degree in 2014 at the University of London. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she was at one stage detained for a week after being accused of cheating in the English test, which she denies. She has not been told to leave the UK, but while remaining in the country cannot work or use the NHS for free. ""During my delivery last year they charged me Â£14,000 just to have a baby,"" she explained. She said her ""dreams and hopes"" were now gone, and she was ""desperate"" to speak to someone at the Home Office to ""prove my innocence"", but after four years of trying ""there is no hope"". She said no evidence of her alleged cheating had been presented to her. The scandal came to light as a result ofa BBC Panorama documentary that looked at centres administering the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). As a result, the Home Office ordered the US firm providing the exams, Educational Testing Service (ETS), to check more than 58,000 tests taken between 2011 and 2014. It said voice-recognition software suggested that proxy test-takers were used in more than 30,000 cases. More than 1,000 people were removed from the country as a result of the investigation. Labour MP Stephen Timms said the Home Office should now allow students to take a ""reliable"" English test Mr Timms, MP for East Ham, told Victoria Derbyshire the treatment of the students had been ""a disgrace"". ""They trusted Britain to provide them with a decent education. Instead, they've been falsely accused of cheating and been given no chance to appeal. ""They've been left in limbo for years."" He said the Home Office should now allow students to take a ""reliable"" English test. ""If they fail, fine. But if they pass, they should be given a visa back in order that they can complete their studies."" A second person accused of cheating, Wahid Rahman, said he had already completed another, similar English test and sent the results to the Home Office. ""But still they're saying, 'we're sticking with our decision',"" he said. ""How else can I prove that I don't need a middleman to speak English on behalf of me?,"" he said, describing the Home Office's approach as ""a mix of denial, obfuscation and delay"". The 29-year-old, originally from Bangladesh, received the cheating allegation in 2014 after graduating from Anglia Ruskin University in marketing and innovation. Wahid Rahman says he is unable to rent, travel or study further ""All my rights have been taken away. ""No jobs, no NHS, I'm not allowed to rent, I'm not allowed to travel, my driving licence has been taken away, I cannot study further. It's just like an open prison. ""I do work with charities but it's unpaid. I'm so lucky to have a good family who can support me."" The organisation Migrant Voice said ""the only solution now is a political one. ""This is a textbook example of this government punishing innocent people in service of the hostile environment, but the home secretary [Sajid Javid] has the power to put some of it right."" Mr Timms said he had spoken to Mr Javid on the issue, saying the minister had told him he was ""sympathetic and that he is going to make a decision about this"". ""I hope it's the right decision,"" he added. The Home Office said in a statement: ""The 2014 investigation into the abuse of English language testing revealed systemic cheating which was indicative of significant organised fraud. ""The scale of the abuse is shown by the fact that 25 people who facilitated this fraud have received criminal convictions, including four individuals convicted earlier this month of conspiracy to commit fraud. ""We have reformed the system to tackle abuse. ""The Home Secretary has listened to the points raised by MPs and other groups and has asked for further advice from the department."" The ETS has been contacted for comment. It has previously told the BBC it ""does everything it can to detect and prevent"" cheating.

"Extinction Rebellion supporters gathered at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park for a ""closing ceremony"" Ten days of protests, blockades and disruption across London has come to a conclusion as Extinction Rebellion ended its action in the capital. Hundreds of activists met in Hyde Park earlier for a ""closing ceremony"". More than 1,100 people have been arrested since campaigners first blocked traffic on 15 April. On the final day of action, protestersblocked roads, climbed on a train and glued themselves togetherin London's financial district.

Protesters cleaned the roads of chalked messages as they packed up their camp at Marble Arch Musicians at Marble Arch marked the final day of action ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world,"" event organisers said on their Facebook page. ""We would like to thank Londoners for opening their hearts and demonstrating their willingness to act on that truth. ""We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.""

"Emmanuel Macron made the live address at the Elysee Palace French President Emmanuel Macron has given a long-awaited response to the yellow vest protest movement with promises of tax cuts, higher pensions and a reform of the civil service. Despite insisting that order must return, he acknowledged a ""lack of trust"" in the establishment. Protests, sometimes violent, started in Novemberover rises in fuel costs but widened to cover a range of grievances over economic inequality. Mr Macron said he stood by his reforms. His speech was originally scheduled for 15 April but was postponed afterthe devastating fire at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. President Macron recognised that at the core of the movement were ""fair demands"". The protests against the fuel price rises - intended to fund eco-friendly projects - escalated into the gilets jaunes, or yellow vest, movement, a national uprising against what protesters see as economic injustice in France. The yellow vest movement spread across the whole of France as well as some parts of the UK When he was elected in 2017, Mr Macron vowed to fight ""the forces of division that undermine France"". Yellow vest violence returns to Paris Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Although he questioned in his speech whether he had taken a ""wrong turn"", he insisted that government reforms so far had been right, but not fast enough. The president said he had ""learnt a lot"" from national debates held with French citizens across the country - an unforeseen political exercise. His plans include: A ""significant cut"" in income tax worth â¬5bn (Â£4.3bn; $5.6bn), financed by spending cuts and closing company tax loopholes, but the French will have to ""work harder"" Reintroduction of inflation-linking for pensions worth less than â¬2,000 a month but more working life spent making pension contributions More decentralised government Extending proportional representation in elections, and making referendums easier to hold Abolition of the ENA university, which has trained political leaders and captains of industry but is seen as elitist by many The president also acknowledged there were concerns in society regarding climate change and immigration. The president's announcement is the culmination of what was touted as a ""grand debate"" with the French people about their concerns. The latest proposals come on top of changes announced in December at a cost of â¬10bn. Those plans, including a government bonus scheme for the low-paid, failed to quell the protests. Yes, there were announcements. More PR at elections (good news for the far right); fewer MPs; lower income tax for the middle classes;  reform (but perhaps not outright abolition) of the National Administration School (ENA); decentralisation of the state administration; longer working lives. And yes, there was partial admission of responsibility for the breakdown of trust between governed and governing that led to the yellow vests. He should have been more human, less arrogant, Mr Macron admitted. But such was not the burden from tonight's marathon press conference. The overall message was not what must now change, but what must remain the same. And that, says Mr Macron, is the overarching ""orientation"" of his presidency. The reforms enacted so far, on tax, labour and education, are the right ones and they are working, he said. There will be more to come. The yellow vests, or the more hard-line among them, will not like it. But they are not Mr Macron's target audience. The target is France as a whole.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has smashed into Mozambique, flattening thousands of homes and flooding low-lying areas. Cyclone Kenneth struck with winds of 220km/h (140mph) barely a month after a previous cyclone killed hundreds and devastated large areas. Heavy rain continued to fall on Friday, raising fears of more floods. Authorities have advised people to move to higher ground amid concern that thousands may be trapped in remote villages. Mozambique was still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 900 people across three countries in March. Cyclone Kenneth had already killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. At least one person has been reported dead in Mozambique after being crushed by a falling tree. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth. It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather. Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over coming days. Aid agencies say they are concerned about communities prone to flooding and landslides. The level of expected rainfall is nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that caused devastating flooding in the port city of Beira, further south, during Cyclone Idai. The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups. Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas, and reports from northern Mozambique said many homes had collapsed and the provincial capital of Pemba had lost its power supply. Kenneth made landfall on Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Communications with the affected areas were disrupted, obscuring the full extent of the damage. Thousands remain away from their homes after compulsory evacuation procedures were put in place by authorities. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, which battered the islands with high winds and heavy rains. The winds have caused widespread power outages and damage to homes. In some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close. Cyclone Kenneth has already devastated areas of the island nation of Comoros Residents in the southern Tanzanian town of Mtwara were earlier told to seek higher ground and shelter, but that warning was stood down. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shared images of the damage on social media. In a tweet, the group confirmed it had volunteers on the ground assisting communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The suspect is a resident of Tenerife A little German boy's testimony led Spanish police to the bodies of his mother and 10-year-old brother in a cave on the island of Tenerife. Police arrested the German father, suspected of killing the two victims. Locals alerted police after finding the distressed five-year-old boy wandering in the mountains near Adeje, muddy and crying, on Tuesday. Spanish media say the German mother and boys had arrived to see the father on Monday. He is a resident on Tenerife. The father was arrested at his apartment, reportedly after a struggle. The victims appear to have been beaten. Spain's Socialist government - facing a general election on Sunday - is treating it as a case of domestic violence and has condemned it on Twitter.Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo called it ""a brutal sexist murder"",external. The Canary Islands are especially popular with German and UK tourists. The police search was hampered by mist on the mountains El PaÃ­s says the cave was found after a long search in mountain mist - the clue was a wristwatch found by a path. The paper quotes sources as saying the father was aggressive and refused to give police any information about his partner and sons.

But officials are leaving it to the judiciary to decide when the boy can return to Germany, as a criminal investigation is under way. A Canary Islands government official, Cristina Valido, said ""although we might be tempted to let the boy return as soon as possible to his normal family life in his country, evidently he witnessed an atrocity and probably it will be the judiciary which decides when he can go home"".

"This video can not be played Huawei leak: Minister says he cannot rule out a criminal investigation The culture secretary has said it is possible there could be a criminal investigation into a leak from a National Security Council meeting. Intelligence agencies must be confident that advice given to ministers is kept private, Jeremy Wright told MPs. The Daily Telegraph reported that the NSC had agreed to let Chinese firm Huawei help build the UK's 5G network. Former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the leak was ""too serious"" for a standard Whitehall inquiry. Sir Michael, who was defence secretary between 2014 and 2017, said everyone who was at the meeting should be subject to a ""proper Scotland Yard investigation"", and it was an ""offence to divulge secret information from the most secret of all government bodies, which is the National Security Council"". The NSC is made up of senior cabinet ministers. Chaired by the prime minister, it meets every week to discuss government objectives concerning national security - with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence invited when needed. It is a place where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. All you need to know about Huawei's problemsHuawei: The story of a controversial company What is 5G and what will it mean for you? But following Tuesday's meeting, theDaily Telegraph reported,externalthat the NSC had agreed to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. It also reported that various ministers had raised concerns about the plan. Former National Security Adviser Lord Ricketts told the BBC it was the first time anyone had committed a major leak from the NSC since its inception in 2010. He added that he was in favour of a full inquiry, possibly involving MI5 investigators, ""to make the culprit feel very uncomfortable"". Theresa May's spokesman said national security was ""of the highest importance"" Theresa May's official spokesman declined to confirm whether a government leak inquiry was under way but said: ""The prime minister is clear that the protection of information on matters of national security is of the highest importance."" Earlier, Mr Wright told the House of Commons: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of a criminal investigation here and everyone will want to take seriously that suggestion."" He said security officials ""need to feel they can give advice to ministers, which ministers will treat seriously and keep private, and if they do not feel that they will not give us that advice and government will be worse as a result"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, in addition to the security issue, anger about the leak demonstrated the frustration inside the government at the breakdown of discipline: Allow Twitter content?

For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said: ""If the leak was for an advantage in a Tory leadership race, that would be truly shocking. ""Critical issues of national security should be handled with utmost care, not used as political ammunition in a Tory party civil war."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has denied the leak came from him, saying it was ""utterly appalling"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also denied the leak came from him. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said leaking sensitive information was ""completely unacceptable"" adding: ""If it happens it should absolutely be looked at."" Ministers at the NSC meeting were deciding whether or not to allow equipment from Huawei to be used to construct the new 5G data network - a decision that could have long-term consequences for national security. There are fears that giving the Chinese company a key role could open the UK network to espionage. But Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. According to the Daily Telegraph,external, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The leak from Tuesday's National Security Committee meeting is both serious and unprecedented. Lord Ricketts, a former National Security Adviser in David Cameron's government, confirmed there had never before been a ""major, deliberate leak"" immediately following an NSC meeting. He is in favour of a formal investigation while others go further, calling for a criminal inquiry involving the police and MI5. So, just why is it so serious? Because the NSC is supposed to be the one place in Whitehall where highly sensitive secret intelligence can be openly shared with ministers. Those present will have signed the Official Secrets Act, clearing them to handle secret intelligence. Breaking that ""circle of trust"" risks undermining the work of Britain's three intelligence agencies - GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 - potentially putting agents in danger. Historically, leak inquiries rarely find the culprit, although in this case there may be an electronic trail that would expose the leaker. What they will do, however, says Lord Ricketts, is to put the fear of God up the culprit, thereby discouraging them from ever doing it again. There have beenwarnings in the US since at least 2012that equipment from Huawei poses a security threat. Last year a UK government report said it could provide ""only limited assurance"" that the company's infrastructure did not pose a threat to national security. Now the US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Australia last year blocked its networks from using Huawei's 5G gear. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

"A formal inquiry is to be held into the leaking of discussions about Huawei at the National Security Council, the BBC has learned. This follows the Daily Telegraph publishing details of a meeting about using the Chinese telecoms firm to help build the UK's 5G network. Several cabinet ministers have denied they were involved in the leak. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is to lead the inquiry, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. The National Security Council (NSC) is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei: The story of a controversial company What is 5G and what will it mean for you? But following Tuesday's meeting, theDaily Telegraph reported,externalthat the NSC had agreed to allow Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. It also reported that various ministers had raised concerns about the plan. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of a criminal investigation here and everyone will want to take seriously that suggestion."" Amid speculation about who was behind the leak, several ministers have denied any involvement.

Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Earlier, former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the BBC: ""All those involved should be investigated now to find out who this leaker is. ""Ministers are subject to the Official Secrets Act just like anybody else. It is an offence to divulge secret information from the most secret of all government bodies, which is the National Security Council. It has got to be stopped."" When questioned, Prime Minister Theresa May replied: ""We don't comment on leaks and on those matters. ""On the overall matter of security and our telecoms network, we are very clear that we give that high priority. We want to ensure we see greater resilience in our telecoms network and that we are able to provide high levels of cyber security, but we also see diversity of suppliers.""

"The UK is advising against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka. The advice from the Foreign Office comes after the Easter Sunday bombings in which more than 350 people died. ""Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka,"" it said in its advice. ""Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners."" Travellers should keep in touch with their airline, tour operator and insurer to see what their options are. They should also,external""remain vigilant, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of local security authorities and hotel security staff"". There are an estimated 8,000 British tourists in Sri Lanka. How you are covered depends on the terms of your policy. If you are due to travel but cancel because of the Foreign Office advice, some insurers will provide cover for your flight or holiday costs. If you are already in Sri Lanka, your travel insurance continues to cover you for medical and other risks. If you want to come home more quickly than planned, insurers ask you to check with your tour operator if you have one to see if they will bring you back. But some will cover you for an early return. It depends on the policy. Tour operators will not send you to Sri Lanka if the Foreign Office advises against it. If departure is imminent - such as the next few days - they will give you the choice of deferring your travel plans in case the advice changes, choosing an alternative holiday, or having your money back. If the advice persists, the option to defer will obviously disappear. But holidaymakers should not suffer financially. Many people travelling to Sri Lanka will have arranged their holidays independently or be visiting family or friends. In these circumstances airlines may be sympathetic and allow you to change flights but they are unlikely to offer a refund. Some insurance policies provide cover if you can't use accommodation you've paid for, but that cover is rare. ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, thinks that there are not many people on packages in Sri Lanka, maybe only a few hundred. They say people who are there should be able to carry on with holidays and come back at the arranged time, as long as they follow Foreign Office advice. Tour operator TUI said: ""We have started to contact customers in resorts and those who are due to travel in the next seven days to discuss changes to travel arrangements. The safety and security of our customers and staff remains our highest priority."" The Association of British Insurers said: ""Travel insurance is designed to cover unforeseen events like this. Cancellation cover under your travel insurance should cover additional costs that cannot be refunded by your travel provider."" ""If you are currently in Sri Lanka and want to curtail your visit and return early, your travel insurance should cover any extra costs associated with rearranging return flights.  Check if you have the necessary cover in place or speak to your travel insurer."" Canada: Advises against all but essential travel. China: Advising Chinese nationals not to travel to Sri Lanka in the near term. US: Exercise increased caution (the third-highest level). Hong Kong: Adjust travel plans, avoid non-essential travel (the second-highest level). Israel: Israeli travellers should leave the island as soon as possible, and those planning to visit were advised to cancel their trips (the second-highest level warning).

"Security is tight in the aftermath of the attacks Sri Lanka has revised down the death toll from last Sunday's wave of bombings by more than 100, to ""about 253"", the health ministry says. It blamed a calculation error and the difficulty of identifying victims. Scores were killed and hundreds injured when suicide bombers struck hotels and churches in Colombo, Negombo and the eastern city of Batticaloa. Most of those killed were Sri Lankan but dozens of foreigners were also among the casualties. Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Police have continued carrying out raids and have issued photographs of seven people wanted in connection with the attacks. Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Sister of âringleaderâ deplores attack The authorities blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), soon after the blasts but say the bombers must have had outside help. The Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks and published a video showing eight men but provided no evidence of direct involvement. In other developments: Sri Lanka's defence secretary, Hemasiri Fernando, the top non-elected official at the department, announced his resignation on Thursday in response to intelligence failures Sri Lankan police apologised after mistakenly releasing a photo of US-based student activist Amara Majeed as one of the suspects The country's Catholic Church has announced the suspension of all church services Members of the Pakistani Ahmadi Muslim community, as well as some Christians and Afghan nationals, have been ejected from their homes in the city of Negombo. Rights activists warned they could face reprisal attacks Police say more than 70 people have now been arrested The UK Foreign Office is now warning against all but essential travelto Sri Lanka This video can not be played Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said morgues had provided inaccurate figures. Another official, the head of health services, told Reuters news agency there had been so many body parts it was ""difficult to give a precise figure"". According to the health ministry, all autopsies had been completed late on Thursday and it transpired that some victims had been counted more than once. BBC World Service South Asia editor Jill McGivering says the revised figure comes as the government is struggling to restore its credibility - amid criticism of its apparent failure to respond to intelligence warnings before the attacks. It's also battling to counter fake news and false rumours about the crisis, she says. This sudden dramatic change in the death toll is unlikely to help. The downward revision means this no longer ranks as the deadliest attack claimed by IS. At least seven suspects are still identified as being at large. Fears of further attacks means that Sri Lanka remains a country on edge, with nightly curfews and security forces making sweeps across the nation, in an effort to root out all connections with the attacks. Over the last few days, a clearer picture has also built up of the bombers, who officials said were well off and well educated and at least one had spent time abroad in the UK and Australia. Thursday saw offices in central Colombo shut early and workers told to go home as well as a brief lockdown in part of the capital because of bomb scares. Rumours and false alarms have also been making the rounds over the past few days. Added to that is the ever-present fear of communal violence and reprisals against Muslims in Sri Lanka. Some Muslims in Sri Lanka report feeling fearful and several Muslim organisations have advised worshippers to stay at home for Friday prayers. In Negombo, a community of refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly belonging to the Ahmadi minority sect from Pakistan, but also including some Christians and Afghan nationals, have been ejected from their homes by landlords. Ahmadi Muslims identify as Muslim and follow the Koran, but are viewed by many orthodox Muslims as heretical. This community of refugees fled persecution and had been sheltering in Sri Lanka - human rights activists say they are likely to have been targeted largely for being both foreign and Muslim. Sri Lanka has a sizeable and centuries-old Muslim population - out of 21 million, just under 10% are Muslim. During Sri Lanka's civil war they were subject to several brutal assaults, and in the years since there has been sporadic violence against Muslims, largely by Sinhalese Buddhists. Muralitharan Kasiviswanathan, BBC Tamil, Negombo As of Wednesday, more than 600 Ahmadis had taken refuge at Faizul Mosque in Negombo, one of the five Ahmadi mosques in Sri Lanka. Most of the Ahmadis were renting their homes from Catholic Christians. Although the bomb blasts happened on Sunday, it was three days later that things got scary for the Ahmadis. ""My home is some streets away from the church. After the attack, the owner of my house was very worried  and asked me to be safe somewhere. I am paying 13,000 rupees [Â£58; $74] for that house. Most of us paid a year's rent an advance. Where will we go now?"" asks 27-year-old Habis Rabba Soaib. About 800 Ahmadis from Pakistan live here with the help of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. Fearing religious prosecution, they fled Pakistan and came to Negombo and hope to eventually seek asylum in Europe or the US. Although the Faizul mosque is small, officials are taking care of them and it is being guarded by the army and the police. More than 5,000 native Ahmadis live in Negombo. Many of them have lived here for years and now own houses and businesses. ""Since we have been here for a long time, nobody is threatening us,"" says one of the Muslim youths who is busy helping the Pakistanis.

"Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week A young mother of two in the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy sits in disbelief. Mohammad Hashim Madaniya has found out that her brother, Zahran Hashim, is the alleged ringleader of a group of suicide bombers who attacked churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing at least 250 people. She says she is horrified by what he has done and fears what could happen next. She has been interviewed by police but is not being treated as a suspect. It's still not clear if Mr Hashim, who is accused of leading a group of bombers (alleged to include two sons of a wealthy tycoon), is alive or dead. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Wearing a white scarf, Ms Madaniya sits uncomfortably in the humidity of Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. She is clearly unhappy with the attention that she is getting. She is the youngest of five siblings and Mr Hashim, believed to be around 40, is the eldest. She insists she has had no contact with her brother since 2017, when he went underground after police tried to arrest him over violence between ideologically opposed Muslim groups. Since Sunday's attacks, a video has emerged in which a man believed to be Zahran Hashim appears pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His is the only face visible among eight men who are said by IS to have carried out the attacks. Sri Lankan police say there were nine attackers in total, including a woman, and that they were all homegrown. They were described as ""educated"" and ""middle class"" - with one having studied in the UK and Australia. Two were sons of a prominent spice trader who is now in custody, and one of the men's wives blew herself up during a raid on Sunday, killing her two children and several police officers, police sources say. ""I came to know about his activities only through the media. I never thought, even for a moment, that he would do such a thing,"" says Ms Madaniya of her brother. ""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more."" Kattankudy's Muslims fear reprisals because the preacher came from their town Her brother, a radical Islamist preacher, came to local prominence a few years ago after he posted several videos on YouTube and other social media platforms denouncing non-believers. Who were the Sri Lanka attackers? The worshipper who blocked a bomber The videos triggered concern among other Muslims, who are a minority in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka. Community leaders have said they raised concerns repeatedly with authorities but were ignored. Officials say they were unable to track him after he went into hiding. But few would have expected a part-time preacher from a small town in eastern Sri Lanka to be able to organise the deadliest suicide bombings in this war-scarred country's history, attracting global attention and fresh scrutiny of links between local extremists and international groups like Islamic State (IS). White flags are hung in Kattankudy to pay tribute to the dead ""We had a very good relationship during our childhood. He was very friendly with everyone in the neighbourhood. But for the last two years, he has not been in contact with us,"" said Ms Madaniya. It is still not clear whether Mr Hashim had direct contact with IS or if he was a local jihadist who pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed the attack. Kattankudy is near the city of Batticaloa, where the Zion Church was bombed on Easter Sunday, killing at least 28 people. The town, of less than 50,000 people, has now been thrust into the spotlight. When I tried to find the ancestral house of Mr Hashim, many people were not willing to answer. People were scared to talk about him. Since the bombings, the Muslim community has been on edge and apprehensive. ""That someone from our area has been linked to the attacks is really a worry for us. We are shocked and upset by it. Our community doesn't support hardliners. We believe in harmony and unity,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair, the leader of the Federation of Kattankudy Mosques. During my visit, Kattankudy was shut down in a day of protest against the carnage. Black and white ribbons fluttered along the main roads as a mark of respect for those killed. The mosque Zahran Hashim founded had hundreds of followers - but is now empty Mr Zubair said he met the radical preacher several years ago and spoke to him about his Islamic traditions, which differed from mainstream local practices. He said the community abhorred violence and that it was taking all steps to stop young people being radicalised. Mr Hashim started as a small-time preacher but, his sister said, soon attracted attention and admiration in some quarters because of his teachings. As his popularity grew. he went around the region preaching Islam. What is National Thowheed Jamath? 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' After the mainstream Islamic groups refused to allow him to speak to their congregations due to his hardline views, he started his own outfit, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) in Kattankudy. He also built a mosque close to the beach and held prayers and classes inside the building. After his controversial hate speeches surfaced on social media, locals say he was expelled from the NTJ. He simply vanished but continued to post incendiary videos from hiding. There is some scepticism locally as to whether he really cut links with the group he founded. Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene has said that a splinter group emerged from the original NTJ. Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair says the community does not support extremists It is still not clear whether Zahran Hashim was one of the suicide bombers. But one thing seems clear: as the government pointed out, those who carried out the bombings must have had some help from abroad. During our conversation, Mr Hashim's sister also revealed that her elderly parents had left their home in the same area a few days before the Easter Sunday bombings and that she had not heard from them since. ""It makes me think that my brother could have kept in touch with them,"" she said. The authorities are also trying to trace Mr Hashim's younger brother. Muslim leaders here maintain that Mr Hashim was an aberration and that their community, like all Sri Lankans, is mourning what they see as senseless attacks. But the fear of reprisals in this small town is very real.

"This video can not be played Jilly Moss's one-year-old daughter contracted measles weeks before she was due to be vaccinated The mum of a baby who had measles so severely that ""her eyes were swollen shut for four days"", says ""parents should know what can happen to vulnerable babies"". Jilly Moss's daughter Alba spent eight days seriously ill in hospital. She was not old enough to have had the first dose of the MMR vaccine. More than half a million children in the UK missed out on the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, the children's charity Unicef says. Globally, 169 million children did not receive the first dose of the measles vaccine over the same seven-year period. There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show. It comes as NHS chief Simon Stevens warned that people rejecting vaccines was a ""growing public health time bomb"". Alba, who is now one and over the worst, was unwell for a couple of weeks with a high temperature and rash, before it spread and covered her entire body. At one point, after deteriorating in hospital in south London, Jilly did not think her daughter would survive. ""It was absolutely terrifying to watch her go through that and be so helpless. ""She didn't know what was going on and it was heartbreaking to see,"" she says. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs, eyes and brain. In one in 25,000 cases, brain complications can be fatal. Alba Moss developed a rash with measles that covered her whole body Babies and children with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications - more common ones include diarrhoea and vomiting, lung infections and fits caused by a fever. Millions of lives worldwide have been saved by the measles vaccinations given to young children - but too many are still dying, Unicef says. Health experts say children should have two doses of the vaccine to fully protect against the disease. In many countries, including the UK,the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella (or German measles).,external the first dose is given to babies around their first birthday the second dose before starting school, when three to four years old But, according to Unicef, a mixture of complacency, misinformation, scepticism about immunisations, and a lack of access to jabs has led to inadequate vaccination rates globally. It estimates that between 2010 and 2017: The US topped the list for the number of unvaccinated children in high-income countries, with 2,593,000 missing the first dose of the vaccine The comparable figure for France was 600,000 The UK came third, with 527,000 children not getting their first dose of the vaccine over the seven-year period In Nigeria, four million children under one did not get the first dose of the vaccine The figures are based onUnicef and World Health Organization,externalestimates of the number of children immunised against diseases in 194 countries in 2017. Figures for the second dose of the measles vaccine ""were even more alarming"", Unicef said. It found 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had not introduced a second dose, putting more than 17 million infants a year at a greater risk of getting measles as a child. In 2017, 85% of children worldwide were vaccinated with the first dose but only 67% with the second dose of the measles vaccine, Unicef says. This video can not be played ""My daughter's life was destroyed by measles"" Henrietta Fore, executive director at Unicef, said: ""The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. ""If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."" Prof Beate Kampmann, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the figures as a ""wake-up call.""

"This video can not be played Edinburgh has seen a surge in visitors using Airbnb Rooms available to book on Airbnb have rocketed in number in major UK cities, leading to fears of ""hollowed out communities"" as tourists flock in. Data analysed by the BBC suggests that listings in Edinburgh doubled in three years, and shows a fourfold increase in spaces in London since 2015. City of Edinburgh Council has called for licensing and London councils want a registration scheme for hosts. Airbnb said it led the way on ""clear and proportionate"" rules. ""Airbnb is the only platform that voluntarily works with UK cities to help hosts share their homes, follow the rules and pay tax. Other platforms and providers need to step up and follow our lead,"" the company said. ""[The platform] allows local families and businesses to benefit from visitors to their communities."" Nearly 80,000 rooms or homes in London are listed on Airbnb - more than any other UK city, according to figures from housing advocacy site Inside Airbnb analysed by the BBC. Just over 12,000 are listed in Edinburgh, but the effect is greater than in London as this accounts for a much bigger proportion of the city's property and population. Edinburgh's 12,000 listings work out to around one Airbnb listing for every 42 residents, while London's Airbnb market equates to one listing per 112 residents. Much of this accommodation is centred around Edinburgh's Old Town - a huge draw for tourists especially during the annual Fringe festival. Airbnb said its activities had boosted the Scottish economy by Â£1.5m a day, and the UK economy as a whole by Â£3.5bn last year. One result has been concern among locals and politicians of a squeeze on housing for residents, the behaviour of some visitors in residential blocks, and differing tax treatment for traditional hotels and guesthouses. Examples of anti-social behaviour in ""party flats"" have been highlighted by campaigners for greater regulation. They included loud, late-night noise affecting one young woman's exam preparation, and an amorous couple bursting into the home of a resident aged in her 80s before realising they had the wrong flat. Councils say it is expensive and time-consuming to tackle such problems with their existing powers. They can only do so after complaints, rather than proactively. What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood - the picture worldwide Council leader sets out Airbnb licensing wish list ""Short term lets are having a terrible impact. They are hollowing out communities, both in the city centre and increasingly across Edinburgh. Residents are putting up with high levels of anti-social behaviour and, very worryingly for us, we believe there is a huge impact on housing supply,"" said Councillor Kate Campbell (SNP), housing convenor at City of Edinburgh Council. ""Housing in Edinburgh is under enormous pressure and we need to take every action we can to protect supply and keep homes affordable for residents, as well as protecting communities."" The Scottish government has been asked to consider a licensing scheme - allowing for checks, safety requirements, and the potential for a cap on numbers. Housing Minister Kevin Stewart (SNP) said it was considering what measures could be required, which would be put to consultation ""to ensure we get the balance of short-term lets right in Scotland"". He said there would be a further announcement within a week. Airbnb said it took action when alerted to rare cases of bad behaviour, pointed out that hosts are subject to income and council taxes, and said it welcomed regulation. However, it also argued that its growth had little effect on the availability of homes for locals to buy or rent, highlighting various studies which had shown that house building had not kept up with demand, and had pushed up prices as a result. It said entire home listings on Airbnb represented less than 0.6% of the available housing stock in Scotland, and some listings on its site were bed and breakfasts, or small hotels, rather than residential property. One of the most popular areas for Airbnb listings in the country is Shoreditch, in London. Its reputation for a thriving nightlife and cultural scene means many listings in the area advertise their ""trendy"" location. The result is the common sight of visitors ""hanging around with Google Maps on their phones"", trying to find their accommodation which could be good for trade, according to local trader Phil Blackman. Graffiti suggests not everyone is happy with the attraction of Shoreditch to tourists Mr Blackman sells shoes just off Brick Lane and says Airbnb has encouraged people to come to the area. ""It is good value for money for them, and they have got to stay somewhere,"" he said. He argued that people working in finance in the City and living there for only a year or two, while offering little to the area, were more responsible for any loss of community spirit. The debate is reflected in one piece of graffiti. ""Tourist go home,"" it says, but underneath someone has added: ""But we love this place"". Many tourists applaud Airbnb for the opportunity to visit cities without paying large city hotel rates. Many homeowners join the chorus, saying the income from occasionally letting a spare room helps pay the bills. However, concerns have been raised that landlords have shifted from offering long-term tenancies to these short-term lettings, restricting supply for people who want to live and work in these cities and putting up the cost of rent as a result. Nearly half of listings come from hosts with more than one property, and in London, 24% of listings are by hosts with five or more sites. It is a similar picture in Manchester and Bristol, according to the Inside Airbnb data. One per cent of hosts control 17% of the London's Airbnb market. In Bristol and Edinburgh, 1% of hosts are responsible for 11% of listings, and in Manchester it is 10%. In London, there are 11 Airbnb hosts with more than 100 listings each. Eight of the 11 are listed with human-sounding host names, like ""Sally"", offering 279 listings, ""Veronica"" (195), and ""Emily"" (179). Airbnb argued that all three identified themselves, basically as property managers. It said hosts may manage the listing process on behalf of a number of different individuals. A 90-day a year short-term let limit for whole homes has been in operation in London since 2015. Owners wishing to let for longer may require planning permission for a ""change of use"" from their local council. Only six changes from a home to a hotel have been approved since the limit was introduced, according to Freedom of Information requests the BBC sent to 32 London boroughs. Airbnb is currently the only platform to have voluntarily implemented the 90-day limit automatically on its platform. The Mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan, wrote in March 2017 to six other online short-term letting platforms operating in London - Veeve, Onefinestay, Wimdu, Booking.com, HomeAway and Airsorted - urging them to follow Airbnb's lead. Homeaway and TripAdvisor have committed to introducing a cap in the future, but other providers have not. This 90-day rule can be easy to flout,London councils told the BBC in 2017. The Mayor of London said on Tuesday that the law was ""near-impossible for councils to enforce"". Mr Khan has now called on the government to introduce a new registration system for anyone wanting to rent out a property for less than 90 days a year - to make it clear who is operating in this sector. Airbnb is supporting this idea. It said it had a team that worked to prevent, detect, and tackle attempts to avoid night limits, and suggested other providers had failed to follow suit. Outside London, planning is more of a grey area. If the property is primarily a home, with a room to let, then planning permission is probably not needed. A planning authority can determine whether there has been a material change of use. A certification scheme for all types of short-term accommodation is operating in Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK which has one.

"Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week A young mother of two in the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy sits in disbelief. Mohammad Hashim Madaniya has found out that her brother, Zahran Hashim, is the alleged ringleader of a group of suicide bombers who attacked churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing at least 250 people. She says she is horrified by what he has done and fears what could happen next. She has been interviewed by police but is not being treated as a suspect. It's still not clear if Mr Hashim, who is accused of leading a group of bombers (alleged to include two sons of a wealthy tycoon), is alive or dead. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Wearing a white scarf, Ms Madaniya sits uncomfortably in the humidity of Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. She is clearly unhappy with the attention that she is getting. She is the youngest of five siblings and Mr Hashim, believed to be around 40, is the eldest. She insists she has had no contact with her brother since 2017, when he went underground after police tried to arrest him over violence between ideologically opposed Muslim groups. Since Sunday's attacks, a video has emerged in which a man believed to be Zahran Hashim appears pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His is the only face visible among eight men who are said by IS to have carried out the attacks. Sri Lankan police say there were nine attackers in total, including a woman, and that they were all homegrown. They were described as ""educated"" and ""middle class"" - with one having studied in the UK and Australia. Two were sons of a prominent spice trader who is now in custody, and one of the men's wives blew herself up during a raid on Sunday, killing her two children and several police officers, police sources say. ""I came to know about his activities only through the media. I never thought, even for a moment, that he would do such a thing,"" says Ms Madaniya of her brother. ""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more."" Kattankudy's Muslims fear reprisals because the preacher came from their town Her brother, a radical Islamist preacher, came to local prominence a few years ago after he posted several videos on YouTube and other social media platforms denouncing non-believers. Who were the Sri Lanka attackers? The worshipper who blocked a bomber The videos triggered concern among other Muslims, who are a minority in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka. Community leaders have said they raised concerns repeatedly with authorities but were ignored. Officials say they were unable to track him after he went into hiding. But few would have expected a part-time preacher from a small town in eastern Sri Lanka to be able to organise the deadliest suicide bombings in this war-scarred country's history, attracting global attention and fresh scrutiny of links between local extremists and international groups like Islamic State (IS). White flags are hung in Kattankudy to pay tribute to the dead ""We had a very good relationship during our childhood. He was very friendly with everyone in the neighbourhood. But for the last two years, he has not been in contact with us,"" said Ms Madaniya. It is still not clear whether Mr Hashim had direct contact with IS or if he was a local jihadist who pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed the attack. Kattankudy is near the city of Batticaloa, where the Zion Church was bombed on Easter Sunday, killing at least 28 people. The town, of less than 50,000 people, has now been thrust into the spotlight. When I tried to find the ancestral house of Mr Hashim, many people were not willing to answer. People were scared to talk about him. Since the bombings, the Muslim community has been on edge and apprehensive. ""That someone from our area has been linked to the attacks is really a worry for us. We are shocked and upset by it. Our community doesn't support hardliners. We believe in harmony and unity,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair, the leader of the Federation of Kattankudy Mosques. During my visit, Kattankudy was shut down in a day of protest against the carnage. Black and white ribbons fluttered along the main roads as a mark of respect for those killed. The mosque Zahran Hashim founded had hundreds of followers - but is now empty Mr Zubair said he met the radical preacher several years ago and spoke to him about his Islamic traditions, which differed from mainstream local practices. He said the community abhorred violence and that it was taking all steps to stop young people being radicalised. Mr Hashim started as a small-time preacher but, his sister said, soon attracted attention and admiration in some quarters because of his teachings. As his popularity grew. he went around the region preaching Islam. What is National Thowheed Jamath? 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' After the mainstream Islamic groups refused to allow him to speak to their congregations due to his hardline views, he started his own outfit, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) in Kattankudy. He also built a mosque close to the beach and held prayers and classes inside the building. After his controversial hate speeches surfaced on social media, locals say he was expelled from the NTJ. He simply vanished but continued to post incendiary videos from hiding. There is some scepticism locally as to whether he really cut links with the group he founded. Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene has said that a splinter group emerged from the original NTJ. Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair says the community does not support extremists It is still not clear whether Zahran Hashim was one of the suicide bombers. But one thing seems clear: as the government pointed out, those who carried out the bombings must have had some help from abroad. During our conversation, Mr Hashim's sister also revealed that her elderly parents had left their home in the same area a few days before the Easter Sunday bombings and that she had not heard from them since. ""It makes me think that my brother could have kept in touch with them,"" she said. The authorities are also trying to trace Mr Hashim's younger brother. Muslim leaders here maintain that Mr Hashim was an aberration and that their community, like all Sri Lankans, is mourning what they see as senseless attacks. But the fear of reprisals in this small town is very real.

"The UK is advising against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka. The advice from the Foreign Office comes after the Easter Sunday bombings in which more than 350 people died. ""Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka,"" it said in its advice. ""Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners."" Travellers should keep in touch with their airline, tour operator and insurer to see what their options are. They should also,external""remain vigilant, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of local security authorities and hotel security staff"". There are an estimated 8,000 British tourists in Sri Lanka. How you are covered depends on the terms of your policy. If you are due to travel but cancel because of the Foreign Office advice, some insurers will provide cover for your flight or holiday costs. If you are already in Sri Lanka, your travel insurance continues to cover you for medical and other risks. If you want to come home more quickly than planned, insurers ask you to check with your tour operator if you have one to see if they will bring you back. But some will cover you for an early return. It depends on the policy. Tour operators will not send you to Sri Lanka if the Foreign Office advises against it. If departure is imminent - such as the next few days - they will give you the choice of deferring your travel plans in case the advice changes, choosing an alternative holiday, or having your money back. If the advice persists, the option to defer will obviously disappear. But holidaymakers should not suffer financially. Many people travelling to Sri Lanka will have arranged their holidays independently or be visiting family or friends. In these circumstances airlines may be sympathetic and allow you to change flights but they are unlikely to offer a refund. Some insurance policies provide cover if you can't use accommodation you've paid for, but that cover is rare. ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, thinks that there are not many people on packages in Sri Lanka, maybe only a few hundred. They say people who are there should be able to carry on with holidays and come back at the arranged time, as long as they follow Foreign Office advice. Tour operator TUI said: ""We have started to contact customers in resorts and those who are due to travel in the next seven days to discuss changes to travel arrangements. The safety and security of our customers and staff remains our highest priority."" The Association of British Insurers said: ""Travel insurance is designed to cover unforeseen events like this. Cancellation cover under your travel insurance should cover additional costs that cannot be refunded by your travel provider."" ""If you are currently in Sri Lanka and want to curtail your visit and return early, your travel insurance should cover any extra costs associated with rearranging return flights.  Check if you have the necessary cover in place or speak to your travel insurer."" Canada: Advises against all but essential travel. China: Advising Chinese nationals not to travel to Sri Lanka in the near term. US: Exercise increased caution (the third-highest level). Hong Kong: Adjust travel plans, avoid non-essential travel (the second-highest level). Israel: Israeli travellers should leave the island as soon as possible, and those planning to visit were advised to cancel their trips (the second-highest level warning).

"On Easter Sunday, suicide bombers killed at least 253 people and injured some 500 at churches and top-end hotels across Sri Lanka. Most victims were Sri Lankans, but at least 38 foreigners are among the dead, including British, Indian and US citizens. The official death toll had reached 359 by Thursday. However, the Sri Lankan government then revised the figure down, blaming a calculation error. Evidence is mounting that local jihadists linked to the Islamic State (IS) group carried out the attack, and police have made a number of arrests. The first reports were at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) on Sunday 21 April. Six blasts took place within a short space of time. As it happened: Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday attacks In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Three were at churches - in the Kochchikade district of the capital, Colombo; in Negombo, to the north; and in the eastern city of Batticaloa. The other three blasts rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in Colombo. Two further explosions were reported later as police searched for suspects - one in Dehiwala in southern Colombo, and another one near the Colombo district of Dematagoda, during a police raid. Sri Lanka is GMT+5.5 21 April 2019 08:45 local time-09:05 Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district are targeted during Easter services and blasts also rock the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. 11:40 local time 13:45 local time 14:15 local time 14:30 local time 14:45 local time 22:00 local time 22 April 2019 06:00 local time About 07:42 local time 08:30 local time At least 290 people, including many foreigners, are now confirmed to have died. More than 500 are injured. About 12:30 local time About 15:27 local time About 16:18 local time Video footage from St Anthony's Shrine, shared by Guardian journalist Michael Safi, showed people running from the area in panic. According to BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen, the blast happened while ""security forces personnel... tried to defuse a newly discovered explosives in a vehicle"". Late on Sunday, an improvised explosive device was found and disposed of close to the country's main airport, near Colombo. Dispatch: St Anthony's - 'church of miracles' And on Monday another blast rocked a street near a church in the capital. Police were attempting to defuse explosives in a vehicle used by the attackers when it blew up. According to police sources, an attack on a fourth hotel failed and helped lead police to the Islamist group now blamed for the assault. On Friday,relatives of the bombers' suspected mastermind,  Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, were among 15 people killedwhen police raided a house in the eastern town of Sainthamaruthu. Hundreds of Sri Lankan families are in mourning.One of the first victims to be indentified was celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne. Other Sri Lankans killed included members of church congregations and staff at the hotels targeted. Who are the victims? Children of the carnage The confirmed international casualties are from the UK, Denmark, Portugal, India, Turkey, Australia, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, Spain, Bangladesh, the US and China. Seven victims belonging to one family were buried in Negombo on Wednesday Among the dead are three children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, owner of the Bestseller clothing chain and the largest shareholder in clothing giant Asos. On Monday Sri Lankan authorities said they believed alittle-known local militant Islamist group known as National Thowheed Jamath(NTJ) was to blame. Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Who were the bombers? On Tuesday, IS said it had carried out the attacks, and released video of men it says were the bombers, pledging allegiance to the group. All but one of the men can be seen with their faces covered. Some are holding knives. The man with his face uncovered has been named as Hashim, who went on to blow himself up at a hotel in Colombo. Security forces remain on high alert at St Anthony's, and across the country IS said ""members of the US-led coalition and Christians in Sri Lanka"" had been targeted. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says that while IS in the past has claimed attacks it was not involved in, this statement is being taken seriously due to the scale of the attacks. The choice of targets is more in line with IS ideology than with traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka, he adds. According to the Sri Lankan government, most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and had come from ""middle- or upper middle-class"" families. Two were sons of a wealthy spice trader, Mohamed Ibrahim, who was arrested after the attacks. The NTJ was banned on Saturday and dozens of arrests have been made since the attacks. A curfew was also imposed. The government admitted a ""major intelligence lapse""after it was revealed that an Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ, but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. President Maithripala Sirisena moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police. Sunday's attacks were the worst ever against Sri Lanka's small Christian minority, who make up just 7% of the 21 million population. Theravada Buddhism is Sri Lanka's biggest religion, accounting for about 70% of the population. Hindus and Muslims make up around 12% and 10% of the population respectively. Christians are a small minority in Sri Lanka The attacks are Sri Lanka's deadliest act of violence since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009. The war is thought to have killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people and ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for independence for the Tamil minority.

"Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week A young mother of two in the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy sits in disbelief. Mohammad Hashim Madaniya has found out that her brother, Zahran Hashim, is the alleged ringleader of a group of suicide bombers who attacked churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing at least 250 people. She says she is horrified by what he has done and fears what could happen next. She has been interviewed by police but is not being treated as a suspect. It's still not clear if Mr Hashim, who is accused of leading a group of bombers (alleged to include two sons of a wealthy tycoon), is alive or dead. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Wearing a white scarf, Ms Madaniya sits uncomfortably in the humidity of Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. She is clearly unhappy with the attention that she is getting. She is the youngest of five siblings and Mr Hashim, believed to be around 40, is the eldest. She insists she has had no contact with her brother since 2017, when he went underground after police tried to arrest him over violence between ideologically opposed Muslim groups. Since Sunday's attacks, a video has emerged in which a man believed to be Zahran Hashim appears pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His is the only face visible among eight men who are said by IS to have carried out the attacks. Sri Lankan police say there were nine attackers in total, including a woman, and that they were all homegrown. They were described as ""educated"" and ""middle class"" - with one having studied in the UK and Australia. Two were sons of a prominent spice trader who is now in custody, and one of the men's wives blew herself up during a raid on Sunday, killing her two children and several police officers, police sources say. ""I came to know about his activities only through the media. I never thought, even for a moment, that he would do such a thing,"" says Ms Madaniya of her brother. ""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more."" Kattankudy's Muslims fear reprisals because the preacher came from their town Her brother, a radical Islamist preacher, came to local prominence a few years ago after he posted several videos on YouTube and other social media platforms denouncing non-believers. Who were the Sri Lanka attackers? The worshipper who blocked a bomber The videos triggered concern among other Muslims, who are a minority in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka. Community leaders have said they raised concerns repeatedly with authorities but were ignored. Officials say they were unable to track him after he went into hiding. But few would have expected a part-time preacher from a small town in eastern Sri Lanka to be able to organise the deadliest suicide bombings in this war-scarred country's history, attracting global attention and fresh scrutiny of links between local extremists and international groups like Islamic State (IS). White flags are hung in Kattankudy to pay tribute to the dead ""We had a very good relationship during our childhood. He was very friendly with everyone in the neighbourhood. But for the last two years, he has not been in contact with us,"" said Ms Madaniya. It is still not clear whether Mr Hashim had direct contact with IS or if he was a local jihadist who pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed the attack. Kattankudy is near the city of Batticaloa, where the Zion Church was bombed on Easter Sunday, killing at least 28 people. The town, of less than 50,000 people, has now been thrust into the spotlight. When I tried to find the ancestral house of Mr Hashim, many people were not willing to answer. People were scared to talk about him. Since the bombings, the Muslim community has been on edge and apprehensive. ""That someone from our area has been linked to the attacks is really a worry for us. We are shocked and upset by it. Our community doesn't support hardliners. We believe in harmony and unity,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair, the leader of the Federation of Kattankudy Mosques. During my visit, Kattankudy was shut down in a day of protest against the carnage. Black and white ribbons fluttered along the main roads as a mark of respect for those killed. The mosque Zahran Hashim founded had hundreds of followers - but is now empty Mr Zubair said he met the radical preacher several years ago and spoke to him about his Islamic traditions, which differed from mainstream local practices. He said the community abhorred violence and that it was taking all steps to stop young people being radicalised. Mr Hashim started as a small-time preacher but, his sister said, soon attracted attention and admiration in some quarters because of his teachings. As his popularity grew. he went around the region preaching Islam. What is National Thowheed Jamath? 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' After the mainstream Islamic groups refused to allow him to speak to their congregations due to his hardline views, he started his own outfit, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) in Kattankudy. He also built a mosque close to the beach and held prayers and classes inside the building. After his controversial hate speeches surfaced on social media, locals say he was expelled from the NTJ. He simply vanished but continued to post incendiary videos from hiding. There is some scepticism locally as to whether he really cut links with the group he founded. Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene has said that a splinter group emerged from the original NTJ. Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair says the community does not support extremists It is still not clear whether Zahran Hashim was one of the suicide bombers. But one thing seems clear: as the government pointed out, those who carried out the bombings must have had some help from abroad. During our conversation, Mr Hashim's sister also revealed that her elderly parents had left their home in the same area a few days before the Easter Sunday bombings and that she had not heard from them since. ""It makes me think that my brother could have kept in touch with them,"" she said. The authorities are also trying to trace Mr Hashim's younger brother. Muslim leaders here maintain that Mr Hashim was an aberration and that their community, like all Sri Lankans, is mourning what they see as senseless attacks.

"Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week A young mother of two in the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy sits in disbelief. Mohammad Hashim Madaniya has found out that her brother, Zahran Hashim, is the alleged ringleader of a group of suicide bombers who attacked churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing at least 250 people. She says she is horrified by what he has done and fears what could happen next. She has been interviewed by police but is not being treated as a suspect. It's still not clear if Mr Hashim, who is accused of leading a group of bombers (alleged to include two sons of a wealthy tycoon), is alive or dead. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Wearing a white scarf, Ms Madaniya sits uncomfortably in the humidity of Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. She is clearly unhappy with the attention that she is getting. She is the youngest of five siblings and Mr Hashim, believed to be around 40, is the eldest. She insists she has had no contact with her brother since 2017, when he went underground after police tried to arrest him over violence between ideologically opposed Muslim groups. Since Sunday's attacks, a video has emerged in which a man believed to be Zahran Hashim appears pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His is the only face visible among eight men who are said by IS to have carried out the attacks.

"The proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda has been blocked by the UK's competition watchdog over fears it would raise prices for consumers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also said,externalit would raise prices at the supermarkets' petrol stations and lead to longer checkout queues. Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe said the regulator was ""effectively taking Â£1bn out of customers' pockets"". But he said the supermarkets had agreed to end the deal. Asda boss Roger Burnley said he was disappointed: ""We were right to explore the potential merger with Sainsbury's, which would have delivered great benefits for customers and supported the long term, sustainable success of our business."" The deal would have created the UK's biggest supermarket chain, accounting for Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries. Sainsbury's and Asda had said the planned tie-up would have cut their costs, allowing them to lower prices for consumers across the UK. Analysts also believed it was designed to help the two supermarkets counter the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in the increasingly competitive grocery market. But the CMA, which had previously raised concerns about the deal, said the merger would lessen competition at both a national and local level. Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600. This video can not be played The CMA's Stuart McIntosh says the deal would have reduced competition Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It would reduce competition in supermarkets and online grocery shopping and at the companies' petrol stations. ""We think that is likely to lead to higher prices or other changes which would be unwelcome to shoppers, such as longer checkout queues."" Earlier this year, Sainsbury's and Asda, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, promised to sell between 125 and 150 of their supermarkets to allow the merger to proceed, along with some petrol stations and convenience stores. They also pledged to bring in Â£1bn of price cutsfor consumers if the deal went ahead, and be held to this by an independent guarantor. Sainsbury's said the CMA had ignored this offer, and misunderstood the potential impact on competition. But the CMA said it had conducted surveys of 60,000 of the supermarkets' customers. ""Those promises were based on cost savings which we don't think are likely to be realised. Also those price promises are very likely to be difficult to track in practice,"" Mr McIntosh said. Next Wednesday is shaping up as the most important day of Mike Coupe's professional life. The chief executive of Sainsbury's has today seen his big gambit, a merger with Asda, fail - and fail utterly. Now he needs to come up with a convincing Plan B, and demonstrate to a sceptical market how Sainsbury's can prosper without what would have been a transformational deal with Asda. If he cannot do that, he will probably have to stand down. Now the companies have said the deal is off, Mr Coupe's task next Wednesday is two-fold. First there is the subtle task of coming up with a new commercial strategy for Sainsbury's as a standalone company, without it looking like there is anything wrong with the current one. This will be difficult given he has spent months explaining why the Asda deal is so necessary, and in the meantime faced accusations that the day-to-day management of the chain is not up to scratch. This will require money - investment in stores and price cuts - and this is his second job. How can Sainsbury's pay for all this and maintain its all-important dividend payments to shareholders? Asda has a different problem. It needs a new owner as its American parent, Walmart, has made it clear it wants out. That could mean a sale to a private-equity investor, or a stock market listing. Neither would be straightforward. Shares in Sainsbury's fell almost 6% following the news, despite many having expected the CMA's decision. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""This returns the focus to the UK grocery market, which is highly competitive, and now both businesses will need to concentrate their energies on reinvigorating and perhaps re-imagining their individual offerings to shoppers."" The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said the ruling was good for jobs. GMB general secretary Tim Roache said: ""Swathes of stores and depots would have to have been sold off, with jobs put at risk and no real benefit for customers or communities. ""The workforce has been through months of uncertainty, worrying about what's going to happen and wondering if their stores or depots would be sold from under them."" Ian Giles, competition partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, called the CMA's ruling ""controversial in competition law circles"". ""It suggests a higher bar than had been the case in previous retail mergers. The parties perhaps underestimated how the scale of this deal, and the CMA's focus on consumer markets, meant they would face such serious obstacles in securing approval.""

"The presenter said he was ""not here to make friends"" but to ""make a difference"" TV naturalist Chris Packham has condemned the hanging of dead crows outside his home in the New Forest as ""ghastly"". It comes as the licensed shooting of crows has been halted after a challenge by his Wild Justice campaign group. Natural England has revoked licences for controlling 16 species of bird, including several types of crow. Mr Packham posted a picture of the crows on social media and said opponents were ""lashing out"". What is believed to be his address has also appeared in an online post urging people to dump dead lambs at his property. Mr Packham said: ""All it does is strengthen my resolve to make the UK countryside a better place for wildlife and the people who live and work there. ""In a very sad and perverse way this ghastly action indicates that I'm making progress. ""As I've always said 'I'm not here to make friends - I'm here to make a difference'."" A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman confirmed a report of criminal damage has been made with the incident believed to have taken place between 20:00 on Wednesday and 06:50 BST on Thursday. Wild Justice was set up by Mr Packham and other campaigners to take legal cases on behalf of wildlife against public bodies. In February it challenged the general licences that allow farmers to shoot birds including wood pigeons, jackdaws and magpies that damage crops or attack livestock. Allow Twitter content?

A statement said: ""We haven't changed the law, we have merely shown that the current system of licensing of killing of certain species of birds, developed and administered by a statutory wildlife agency, is unlawful now and presumably has been for decades."" Natural England said it revoked three licences for controlling certain wild birds following the challenge and was working on ""alternative measures"" that would allow lawful control of the bird species to continue where necessary. The move provoked a backlash from farmers groups and others. A Change.org petition calling on the BBC to ""sack Chris Packham"" has received more than 85,000 signatures. But a counter petition has since been set up opposing any potential sacking, saying ""as a journalist [he] should be allowed to use his platform to inform everyone the reality of our dying planet"".

"The government has approved the supply of equipment by Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network despite warnings of a security risk. There is no formal confirmation but theDaily Telegraph says,externalHuawei will build ""non-core"" components such as antennas. The US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Huawei has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. But Australia has already said it is siding with Washington - which has spoken of ""serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere"". UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei Huawei - The world's most controversial company Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? 5G: 'A cyber-attack could stop the country' A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said it is reviewing the supply of equipment for the 5G network and will report in due course. Digital minister Margot James responded to the reports bytweeting,external: ""In spite of Cabinet leaks to the contrary, final decision yet to be made on managing threats to telecoms infrastructure."" According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" infrastructure of the 5G network. This would mean Huawei would not supply equipment for what is known as the ""core"" parts - where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice calls and data take place. Huawei, a private company which already supplies equipment for the UK's existing mobile networks, has always denied claims it is controlled by the Chinese government. It said it was awaiting a formal announcement, but was ""pleased that the UK is continuing to take an evidence-based approach to its work"", adding it would continue to work cooperatively with the government and the industry. Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre - which oversees Huawei's current UK work - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a framework would be put in place to ensure the 5G network was ""sufficiently safe"". Asked about the potential of a conflict in the position of Five Eyes members, he added: ""In the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well."" 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says it is believed the decision to involve Huawei was taken by ministers at a meeting of the government'snational security council,externalon Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. The home, defence and foreign secretaries were reported to have raised concerns during the discussions. In atweet,external, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said using Huawei equipment would raise ""serious questions"" about the ""government's interests and how they will secure networks"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The decision on Huawei is one of the most significant long-term national security decisions this government will make and was always going to be contentious. 5G will underpin our daily lives in ways that are hard to predict. So does allowing a Chinese company to build those networks put people at risk of being spied on or even switched off? That is the concern from Washington and other critics who wanted the company excluded. But deciding to ban Huawei entirely from the network would have risked slowing down the development of 5G and also upsetting China. The UK believes it has experience in managing the risks posed by Huawei and can continue to do so going forward. But one retired senior intelligence official recently told me his view on what to do about Huawei had changed. In the past, he said, he had believed the policy of managing the risk had been sufficient. But now he was less sure. The reason was not to do with any change in his view of what the company could do. Rather it was about the risks to relationships with close allies, namely those of the Five Eyes and US. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhattweeted,externalthat allowing Huawei to build some of the UK's 5G infrastructure would ""cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to #FiveEyes cooperation"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said the proposals still raised concerns, as 5G involved an ""internet system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make"". 'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Joyce Hakmeh, a research fellow at think tank Chatham House and co-editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, said the UK's current mobile network needs to be transformed to the ""the next level... quicker, more stable 5G"". But she added the government would be hoping its decision on Huawei did not upset either China or the US. Limiting - but not barring - Huawei technology from the 5G networks would be a ""diplomatic way of managing a difficult situation"" for the UK, said Ms Hakmeh. Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?

"The UK government has announced a series of measures to remove the Chinese phone-maker Huawei from the UK's 5G mobile networks. It will ban UK mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and they will have to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The government had previously said Huawei could be involved in the project but it changed its mind following growing security concerns about China. Huawei was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, southern China, by Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer. It started making communications equipment for mobile phone networks and is now a global leader, employing 180,000 workers. Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone supplier after Samsung,external, with 18% of the market - ahead of Apple and others. At the heart of the debate is a simple question: can the West trust Huawei or will using its equipment leave communication networks, and our own mobile phones, vulnerable? The US says Huawei could be used by China for spying, via its 5G equipment. It points to Mr Ren's military background and Huawei's role in communications networks to argue it represents a security risk. Mr Ren was member of China's army, the People's Liberation Army, for nine years until 1983. He is also a member of China's Communist party. Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987 But Huawei says this is not relevant: ""When Ren Zhengfei was a young man, you needed to be a Communist Party member to have any position of responsibility."" Washington has banned US firms from doing business with Huawei (for example, designing and producing chips) and wants its allies to ban it from their 5G networks. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US. For the UK, pressing ahead with using Huawei equipment could have affected vital UK-US trade talks (after Brexit) and the US warned such a decision could risk future security co-operation. But deciding to ban Huawei from 5G in the UK, could risk Chinese retaliation such as a possible cyber attack. Many countries are preparing to move from 4G to more advanced 5G mobile networks. Download speeds 10 times faster than today will radically change how we work, communicate and stream videos. In theory, controlling the tech at the heart of these networks could give Huawei the capacity to spy or disrupt communications during any future dispute. This is important, as more things - from self-driving cars to fridges, baby monitors and fire alarms become connected to the internet. The concern is that state-sponsored hackers could use these devices, which often have weaker security features, as back doors into strategically vital networks. For instance, this could make it possible to shut down a rivals' power stations. But removing Huawei equipment from the networks will have a significant impact on the roll-out of the UK's 5G technology. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be delayed by two to three years and with added costs of up to Â£2bn. The UK has been using Huawei kit since 2005 The US argues China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, which says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"", means Beijing could force Huawei to do its bidding. Huawei says it's never been asked to spy and ""would categorically refuse to comply"". It adds: ""We would never compromise or harm any country, organization, or individual, especially when it comes to cyber-security and user privacy protection."" To monitor the company, the UK set up the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, which comes under the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). In March 2019, it said it hadn't found evidence of malicious Chinese state activity, but it did identify some serious defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security competence. Announcing the ban on 14 July, Mr Dowden said NSCS has now ""significantly changed their security assessment"" of Huawei's presence in the UK's 5G network. He said the decision followed Washington's tougher stance on the company but did not give further details. US buyers will almost certainly favour kit from US companies, such as Cisco, Juniper Networks, or Qualcomm. In Europe, 5G manufacturers include Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Nokia has issued a statement saying: ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed."" The government says it will look at ""multiple vendors"" and will bring forward a Telecoms Security Bill in the autumn. The action does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers. If you use a Huawei phone, it's very unlikely the firm's handing your data to the Chinese government, though it is possible. In the same way, technically, data from a Google Pixel phone could be handed over to the US government. Newer Huawei models like this Huawei Mate 30 Pro won't get Android updates automatically In March last year, Google halted Huawei's licence for Android - the operating system for most of the world's phones, aside from Apple's iPhone. If your Huawei phone was issued before the ban it will receive Android updates, but newer models won't. However Huawei is trying to work around this. As Huawei is from Guangdong province where Cantonese is the main dialect, the firm says its name should be pronounced ""wah-way"". However, some Mandarin speakers argue that the name is pronounced ""hwah-way"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played CCTV captures a high-speed chase towards the M8 motorway Six men have been found guilty of a series of attempted murders in what the High Court heard was a conspiracy of murderous violence. It was carried out by associates of the Lyons criminal family against men associated with their rivals, the Daniel family. They were convicted of attacks over a six-month period from December 2016. The final and most violent assault happened on the approach road to one of Scotland's busiest motorways. The jury was told it was only by good luck or determination that all those who were attacked survived. Peter Bain, Brian Ferguson, Andrew Gallacher and John Hardie were among six men found guilty Brian Ferguson, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 40, Robert Pickett, 53, Andrew Sinclair, 32, John Hardie, 35, and Peter Bain, 45, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. They targeted Robert Daniel, Thomas Bilsland, Gary Petty, Ryan Fitzsimmons and Steven Daniel between June 2016 and September 2017 at locations in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Manchester. Judge Lord Mulholland told them the courts take a dim view of such ""gangsterous conduct"". Police found a haul of weapons in a lock-up garage as part of the police operation A shotgun was among the weapons The judge added: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a warzone with your feud."" He said any suggestion of a ""private"" dispute ""could not be further from the truth"". Lord Mulholland said: ""Be under no illusion what will be coming your way when you return to court."" The men were remanded in custody pending sentencing next month. A Landrover Discovery was found after the attack on Robert Daniel The first target was Robert Daniel, whose car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston on 8 December 2016. Once inside the house he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. Asked in court if he was aware of any ill-feeling between the Daniel and Lyons families, Robert, 29, replied: ""Not that I know of."" A burnt-out BMW was found after an attack on Ryan Fitzsimmons in April 2017 A month later Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. Bilsland, 31, told the jury he was heading to the front door of his mother's home when he was ""hit with something from behind"". He added: ""I kind of fell.. there were three or four guys with masks on. They were round about me. It was all a blur. ""The only thing I was paying attention to was getting to my feet and away. I was in shock, I panicked."" Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull when he was attacked The next victim, Gary Petty, was targeted after he visited an Italian takeaway on 7 March 2017 The court heard he was getting out his Volkswagen Golf when he was struck in Maryhill. He recalled: ""I dropped the food and covered my head to try and protect myself. ""I was just getting hit. I think it was a machete. It all happened so fast."" Gary Petty was attacked as he arrived at his girlfriend's house with a takeaway Former soldier Ryan Fitzsimmons was left unconscious and brain-damaged after being ambushed in the street by a masked gang on 28 April 2017. The 34-year-old was attacked with a sword and a hammer outside the home he shared with his mother in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He told jurors: ""It felt like death was coming."" His mother Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened she suffered a heart attack in the street. An Audi car was used in the attack on Steven Daniel A machete was found in the back of the burnt-out car Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but the court was told he was targeted because his older brother, Martyn, was a convicted criminal who had once been charged with shooting a man called Ross Monaghan, an associate of the accused men. The most savage crime was the assault on Steven ""Bonzo"" Daniel. His Skoda Octavia was first pursued in a high-speed chase which started in Milton and ended up in a crash on an off-ramp of the M8. The relentless attack which followed almost severed his nose from his face and detached his top jaw from his skull. The targeted cleaver and hammer attack on 18 May 2017 left the ex-taxi firm director with facial wounds so severe that first responders initially thought he had been shot. Police later found a car which had been used in the Steven Daniel attack. Steven Daniel was chased in his taxi A tracking device was found under Steven Daniel's car The Audi S3 had been set on fire but a bloodied machete was still in the back seat. But detectives were also interested in the cars driven by the victims because they had been fitted with tracking devices. This led police all the way back to the men in the dock When officers raided their properties they found samurai swords, machetes, false number plates, firearms and baseball bats - though never any baseballs. The prosecution evidence pointed to these attacks being a coordinated vendetta but Steven Daniel, the victim of the most shocking attack, denied that the Daniel family were a serious crime gang. He also denied they were involved in a dispute with the Lyons family and even when asked directly by the judge, Daniel denied he knew of any enemies.

"Knife crime in England and Wales rose to record levels last year, data shows. Police recorded 40,829 offences involving knives or sharp instruments in 2018, up 6% on the year before. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalsaid cases of murder and manslaughter, excluding terror attacks, increased by 12%. There were 732 killings, up from 655 in 2017 - the highest since 2007. The separate Crime Survey, based on people's experiences, points to no significant change in overall crime. The police-recorded knife crime figures come amid a national debate on the issue, following a spate of assaults and killings involving young people. They show these recorded offences are continuing to rise and are at their highest level since 2011 - the year that knife crime statistics started to be gathered in a unified way. However, they show the rate of increase appears to be slowing. Offences rose 9% in the 12 months to September 2018 - after a 13% rise in the 12 months to June 2018. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Reality Check: Is there more crime? London killings: All the victims of 2018 According to the statistics, there was an increase in knife offences recorded in 31 of the 43 police forces in 2018. The Metropolitan Police recorded the most knife offences - 14,660 - representing a 1% yearly rise.  The biggest increase of 54% was recorded by British Transport Police, while Merseyside saw a 35% rise and Dyfed-Powys 28%. The figures show there were 252 killings involving a knife or sharp instrument in 2018. There were 18,950 assaults and 17,402 robberies where a knife or sharp instrument was used. The knife crime statistics do not include Greater Manchester Police because of differences in the way the force has been recording offences. Meanwhile, the number of killings in 2018 last year was at its highest in any calendar year since 2007, when the total reached 765. The Home Office has announced proposals for teachers and NHS workers to help tackle youth crime, as well asmore stop and search powers for police. Policing minister Nick Hurd said recent figures from the Metropolitan Police suggested that action to tackle violent crime was having an impact. He added: ""Law enforcement alone is not the answer which is why our serious violence strategy puts a greater focus on prevention - including by consulting on a proposed new duty to underpin a public health approach to serious violence, and investing over Â£220m in projects to steer young people away from crime."" Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ""The police are completely overstretched and crime prevention work is far too limited. The Labour MP added: ""The Home Office and government response on knife crime and other rising crimes is still far too weak and just doesn't match the scale of the problem."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the recorded crime figures were ""deeply troubling"" and showed ""reckless cuts"" to police forces were having an impact. This video can not be played Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes was killed outside his London school in 2017 - his father Paul Barnes described what happened The police recorded-crime figures also show robberies rose 11% and vehicle thefts 9%. There was 2% fall in firearms crimes in 2018, a total of 6,525 offences. The total number of crimes recorded by police in 2018 was 5.8m, a year-on-year increase of 7%. The data was published at the same time as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime and includes offences that are not reported to police. This video can not be played 'I live in fear of knives' It suggests there was a 12% increase in fraud offences but a 28% decrease in computer misuse and a 3% fall in burglaries. It also suggests there was no overall increase in violent offences. This is in contrast to the police - who recorded a 19% rise in violent offences last year to 1.6m. The Office for National Statistics considers the survey a more reliable indication of such overall trends as it includes lower-level attacks which may not be reported to police. Alexa Bradley, from the Office for National Statistics, said: ""It is important to look at each crime type separately because the picture is very mixed.

"A humpback whale was entangled in rope for ""weeks, if not months"" before it drowned off the coast of East Lothian, a post-mortem examination has found. The young male, which was about nine metres long (30ft),was found at John Muir Country Park, near Tyningham. Experts said the marine mammal had become very weak and had the most parasites they had ever seen. The whale was towed out to sea and moved to another beach for the five-hour necropsy on Wednesday. Dr Andrew Brownlow, veterinary pathologist for the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, told the BBC Scotland news website he had found nothing in the whale's stomach. He said: ""This was an entanglement case and from the tissue lesions it had been like this for weeks, if not months. ""It stops the animal from being able to feed properly or exhibit normal behaviour, which weakens the animal and then it drowns. ""It's a real eye opener for us on the effect we can have on animals."" He added: ""Its lesions were very chronic and its parasite burden was the most I have ever seen in an animal of this size. ""It had become weak because it could not feed which, in turn, meant its immune system weakened, which meant its parasite burden increased. ""So the poor animal was fighting the ropes and a heavy burden of parasites."" He said he was pleased at least to find no plastic in the whale's stomach. Dr Brownlow said fishermen's ropes were often longer than the distance from the surface of the sea to the bottom so they formed coils, which was a trap for anything that swam through it. He added: ""In evolutionary terms a whale has learned to spin around to avoid an attachment but this strategy is the worst thing it could do when it's entangled as it makes the situation worse. ""It then has caught something else on the ropes around it which has made it a higher weight and it's actually drowned. It was pretty horrific."" Humpback whales breed in warmer waters in the Azores before moving to more northern waters to take advantage of the food stocks during the summer months. East Lothian Council has now removed the whale for incineration.

"This video can not be played The actor says the makers of the 25th Bond film will reflect changing attitudes. Oscar-winning actor Rami Malek is to play a villain in the 25th official James Bond film - but the movie still does not have a title. The cast and creative team have been unveiled at a launch event in Jamaica, with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge confirmed as one of the writers. The unnamed film, which will be released next April, will be Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as 007. Malek won an Oscar for playing singer Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Rami Malek won an Oscar for playing Freddie Mercury Phoebe Waller-Bridge was responsible for the first series of Killing Eve The official plot summary mentions ""a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology"". Details of Malek's character haven't been revealed and he wasn't at the official launch on Thursday, but he sent a video message confirming he will play a villain. ""I'm stuck here in New York in production but I'm very much looking forward to joining the whole cast and crew,"" said the Egyptian-American actor, who is currently filming TV show Mr Robot. ""I will be making sure Mr Bond does not have an easy ride in this, his 25th outing. See you all soon."" After watching that, Craig joked that he was ""scared"" about what lay in store for Ian Fleming's suave secret agent. Left-right: Lea Seydoux, Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris and Lashana Lynch at the Bond 25 launch Bond will again be called upon to save the world from a shadowy adversary - all in a day's work for 007. The official plot summary reads: ""Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. ""The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology."" At the launch, producer Barbara Broccoli said Bond's attitudes to women would move with the times. ""The Me Too movement has had a huge impact - rightfully, thankfully - on society, and these films should reflect that, as everything we do should,"" she said. Craig told BBC News: ""Bond has always adapted for the times. But you're dealing with a character who is flawed, who has issues, and I think that's something that's worth still exploring and grappling with. ""Of course, we wouldn't be movie-makers or creative people if we didn't have an eye on what was going on in the outside world."" Lea Seydoux appeared with Daniel Craig in 2015's Spectre It was also confirmed thatRalph FiennesandBen Whishawwill return as M and Q respectively, withNaomie Harriscoming back as Moneypenny andRory Kinnearagain playing MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner.

The film is being directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, whose credits include the first series of HBO's True Detective andNetflix's Maniac.

"Emperor penguins need a reliable and stable platform of sea-ice Thousands of emperor penguin chicks drowned when the sea-ice on which they were being raised was destroyed in severe weather. The catastrophe occurred in 2016 in Antarctica's Weddell Sea. Scientists say the colony at the edge of the Brunt Ice Shelf has collapsed with adult birds showing no sign of trying to re-establish the population. And it would probably be pointless for them to try as a giant iceberg is about to disrupt the site. The dramatic loss of the young emperor birds is reported by a team from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). Penguin super-colony spotted from space 'No role' for climate in Halley iceberg Can you spot ocean plastic from space? The developing chasm in the Brunt Ice Shelf may have doomed the colony anyway Drs Peter Fretwell and Phil Trathan noticed the disappearance of the so-called Halley Bay colony in satellite pictures. It is possible even from 800km up to spot the animals' excrement, or guano, on the white ice and then to estimate the likely size of any gathering. But the Brunt population, which had sustained an average of 14,000 to 25,000 breeding pairs for several decades (5-9% of the global population), essentially disappeared overnight. 2015: The guano stains at Halley colony are visible from space Emperors are the tallest and heaviest of the penguin species and need reliable patches of sea-ice on which to breed, and this icy platform must persist from April, when the birds arrive, until December, when their chicks fledge. If the sea-ice breaks up too early, the young birds will not have the right feathers to start swimming. This appears to have been what happened in 2016. This video can not be played Curious emperor penguins take a selfie video in Antarctica Strong winds hollowed out the sea-ice that had stuck hard to the side of the thicker Brunt shelf in its creeks, and never properly reformed. Not in 2017, nor in 2018. Dr Fretwell said: ""The sea-ice that's formed since 2016 hasn't been as strong. Storm events that occur in October and November will now blow it out early. So there's been some sort of regime change. Sea-ice that was previously stable and reliable is now just untenable."" The BAS team believes many adults have either avoided breeding in these later years or moved to new breeding sites across the Weddell Sea. A colony some 50km away, close to the Dawson-Lambton Glacier, has seen a big rise in its numbers. Milk ducts as you've never seen them before Effect of Airbnb surge on UK cities revealed DNA reveals origin of Stonehenge builders This video can not be played Peter Fretwell: ""Storms can now hollow out the emperors' sea-ice in October and November"" Quite why the sea-ice platform on the edge of the Brunt shelf has failed to regenerate is unclear. There is no obvious climate signal to point to in this case; atmospheric and ocean observations in the vicinity of the Brunt reveal little in the way of change. But the sensitivity of this colony to shifting sea-ice trends does illustrate, says the team, the impact that future warming in Antarctica could have on emperor penguins in particular. Research suggests the species might lose anywhere between 50% and 70% of its global population by the end of this century, if sea-ice is reduced to the extent that computer models envisage. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external This would have consequences beyond just the emperors themselves, commented Dr Michelle LaRue, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. ""They're an important part of the food web; they're what we call a mesopredator. They're both prey for animals like leopard seals but they also prey themselves on fish and krill species. So, they do play an important role in the ecosystem,"" she told BBC News. 2018: The Dawson-Lambton colony has increased its numbers Dr Trathan said: ""What's interesting for me is not that colonies move or that we can have major breeding failures -  we know that. It's that we are talking here about  the deep embayment of the Weddell Sea, which is potentially one of the climate change refugia for those cold-adapted species like emperor penguins. ""And so if we see major disturbances in these refugia - where we haven't previously seen changes in 60 years - that's an important signal."" Whether the Halley Bay colony specifically really had a future is a moot point. This video can not be played Scientists have called for special status to protect coral, penguins and other wildlife in Antarctica. The Brunt Ice Shelf is being split apart by a developing crack. This chasm will eventually calve an iceberg the size of Greater London into the Weddell Sea, and any sea-ice stuck to the berg's edge may break up in the process. The colony could have been doomed regardless of what happened in 2016. Drs Peter Fretwell and Phil Trathan report their investigationin the journal Antarctic Science,external.

"This video can not be played Jilly Moss's one-year-old daughter contracted measles weeks before she was due to be vaccinated The mum of a baby who had measles so severely that ""her eyes were swollen shut for four days"", says ""parents should know what can happen to vulnerable babies"". Jilly Moss's daughter Alba spent eight days seriously ill in hospital. She was not old enough to have had the first dose of the MMR vaccine. More than half a million children in the UK missed out on the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, the children's charity Unicef says. Globally, 169 million children did not receive the first dose of the measles vaccine over the same seven-year period. There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show. It comes as NHS chief Simon Stevens warned that people rejecting vaccines was a ""growing public health time bomb"". Alba, who is now one and over the worst, was unwell for a couple of weeks with a high temperature and rash, before it spread and covered her entire body. At one point, after deteriorating in hospital in south London, Jilly did not think her daughter would survive. ""It was absolutely terrifying to watch her go through that and be so helpless. ""She didn't know what was going on and it was heartbreaking to see,"" she says. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs, eyes and brain. In one in 25,000 cases, brain complications can be fatal. Alba Moss developed a rash with measles that covered her whole body Babies and children with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications - more common ones include diarrhoea and vomiting, lung infections and fits caused by a fever. Millions of lives worldwide have been saved by the measles vaccinations given to young children - but too many are still dying, Unicef says. Health experts say children should have two doses of the vaccine to fully protect against the disease. In many countries, including the UK,the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella (or German measles).,external the first dose is given to babies around their first birthday the second dose before starting school, when three to four years old But, according to Unicef, a mixture of complacency, misinformation, scepticism about immunisations, and a lack of access to jabs has led to inadequate vaccination rates globally. It estimates that between 2010 and 2017: The US topped the list for the number of unvaccinated children in high-income countries, with 2,593,000 missing the first dose of the vaccine The comparable figure for France was 600,000 The UK came third, with 527,000 children not getting their first dose of the vaccine over the seven-year period In Nigeria, four million children under one did not get the first dose of the vaccine The figures are based onUnicef and World Health Organization,externalestimates of the number of children immunised against diseases in 194 countries in 2017. Figures for the second dose of the measles vaccine ""were even more alarming"", Unicef said. It found 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had not introduced a second dose, putting more than 17 million infants a year at a greater risk of getting measles as a child. In 2017, 85% of children worldwide were vaccinated with the first dose but only 67% with the second dose of the measles vaccine, Unicef says. This video can not be played ""My daughter's life was destroyed by measles"" Henrietta Fore, executive director at Unicef, said: ""The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. ""If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."" Prof Beate Kampmann, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the figures as a ""wake-up call."" She said: ""Measles is highly infectious, even before the typical rash appears, so you cannot simply 'keep away'. ""We must protect children and communities against this potentially very serious but entirely preventable infectious disease - and the only way to do that is through vaccination."" Anti-vaccine views wrong - chief doctor Measles cases hit record high in Europe Global measles resurging, WHO warns Measles - the disease that returned from the past Public Health England said though the overall risk to the public in England was low, unimmunised people were in danger of catching the disease while outbreaks continued in Europe. This video can not be played The BBC investigated in 2018 why there's been a measles outbreak in Europe Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease so far this year, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, while a spike in case numbers has been reported in the US and Thailand. In Greater Manchester,more cases have been recorded this year than in the whole of the previous two years combined. NHS chief Simon Stevens has warned that""vaccination deniers"" have been gaining traction on social media, leading to the spread of misleading information. The Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, has called for new legislation toforce social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines.

"It is hoped that used coffee grounds could replace the use of palm oil in many household products Two Scottish entrepreneurs are aiming to go global with their hope to replace palm oil using coffee waste. Scott Kennedy and Fergus Moore said they came up with a unique way to extract oil from used coffee grounds which had a wide range of uses. Palm oil is found in many household products, but environmentalists say demand for it is devastating rainforests in Asia. Manufacturers are now under pressure to find an alternative. Mr Kennedy and Mr Moore came up with their idea while working in coffee shops during their time studying business at Glasgow's Strathclyde university, and saw first-hand the amount of food waste in the hospitality industry. Palm oil: Are your beauty products killing orangutans? Warning of palm oil threat to primates Small changes you can make for a greener life Mr Moore told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""About 60% of a cafe's waste is about coffee grounds. ""In Scotland, that amounts to about 40,000 tonnes a year - across the UK, more than half a million tonnes. ""And coffee grounds are so heavy that it takes their waste bill through the roof."" Explaining the idea behind his Revive Eco company, Mr Moore said: ""There are oils in coffee with a wide range of uses in different industries - cosmetics pharmaceuticals, food and drink, household products - you name it, there's probably a use there. ""We're developing a process to extract and purify these oils."" Scott Kennedy and Fergus Moore came up with their business while working in the hospitality sector as students Mr Moore added: ""The most exciting part for us is that they have all the same components as palm. ""Palm oil'sin the news for all the wrong reasons. It's really exciting for us that we could potentially provide a local and more sustainable alternative to all the industries that are currently using palm oil."" Mr Moore said it had been difficult setting up the company because he and his business partner were not from an engineering background, but added: ""We've surrounded ourselves with incredible advisors and mentors that have made the process easier."" Revive Eco has already secured Â£235,000 of funding from the Zero Waste Scotland agency. The entrepreneurs said oil extracted from used coffee grounds could be used in a wide range of household products And now they are in the running for a share of a Â£776,000 funding pot, after it was announced Revive Eco would be representing Scotland and Northern Ireland in the Chivas Venture competition. Twenty global companies are competing for the prize, being announced in Amsterdam in May, after an online public vote. Mr Moore said of the company's ambition: ""We want to have the process up and running in Glasgow by next summer. Longer term, we want to build the business to a place where we can franchise into different countries and replicate the business model elsewhere. ""We'd rather build a new process in Rome, Paris, Berlin - any other big coffee-drinking cities round the world.""

"The Sydney Daily Telegraph has apologised for the printing error One of Australia's most popular tabloids has blamed a printing error after pages from a rival newspaper appeared in its Thursday edition. The Sydney-based Daily Telegraph, a right-leaning tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, accidentally printed two pages of the liberal Sydney Morning Herald. The pages include a letter calling for action to tackle climate change. The Telegraph has apologised for the mistake and said it happened during the production process.

He then travelled to Christchurch, where he asked officers and medics about how they had put their training into practice. ""Nothing really trains you for seeing it in real life"", said the duke, who has spent time as a pilot with the air ambulance service in East Anglia. ""I'm sure the team pulls together,"" he said. Prince William met some of the first responders to the Christchurch mosque attacks during a visit to the city's Justice and Emergency Services Precinct New Zealand police commissioner Mike Bush said the ""emotion was palpable"" during the visit and the duke was concerned with how those involved were coping a month on from the attacks. ""His main piece of advice was to talk to each other, to not bottle things up - to support each other to talk about what they saw and what they do afterwards,"" he said. Attack victims honoured in Christchurch UK survivor 'cradled woman' in NZ shooting The people killed as they prayed Christchurch: Survivor recounts attack At the police headquarters, dozens of messages from the people of Christchurch were pinned up along the corridors, thanking officers for their work after the shootings.

Prince William is travelling on behalf of the Queen at the request of Ms Ardern. She said the visit would ""bring comfort"" as the duke had a ""close connection"" with New Zealand and Christchurch in particular. ""His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community,"" she said.

"Mr Lidington is in Glasgow for a major cybersecurity conference Theresa May's deputy has said the Scottish Parliament will not be given the power to hold an independence referendum by 2021. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said there was ""no evidence"" of a surge in support for another vote. And he said the referendum in 2014 had settled matters for a generation. Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday she wants a referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. But the first minister also indicated that Westminster's approval was needed to put the legal status of any vote ""beyond doubt"". She has not yet made a fresh request to the UK government for this to happen, but told BBC Scotland that Mr Lidington was a member of a UK government that is ""clinging to power by its fingertips"" and has ""zero authority or credibility"". Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Ms Sturgeon added: ""I'm not going to spend too much time bothering about the diktats of a government that I expect will be out of office before too long."" And she said the UK government should have to answer ""why they think it is acceptable to block a democratic vote that has a clear mandate in the Scottish Parliament and with the Scottish people"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Downing Street has repeatedly said it does not believe a second referendum should be held - and made clear after Ms Sturgeon's statement on Wednesday that its position has not changed. When asked by BBC Scotland whether this meant the UK government was ruling out granting a Section 30 order - which formed the legal basis for the last referendum - before 2021, Mr Lidington replied: ""Yes. We don't see the case for that. ""This was supposed to be settled for a generation in 2014 and we should stick to that."" He added that there was ""no evidence since then that the appetite of the Scottish people to go through a referendum once again has surged up"". Mr Lidington, who was in Glasgow for a major cybersecurity conference, also said: ""What I pick up whenever I come to Scotland is people saying we want our schools to improve, we want the problems in the hospitals sorted out, we want more jobs, higher living standards and start to get more business investment. ""The UK government wants to work with the Scottish government on those things"". First Minister Alex Salmond and Prime Minister David Cameron signed an agreement that paved the way for the 2014 referendum to be held The first minister hopes a ""framework Bill"" - Scottish Parliament legislation setting the rules for any future referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. In her long-awaited statement to MSPs on Wednesday afternoon, she said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister also predicted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" She announced she wants cross-party talks with opposition leaders about Holyrood's powers, while a Citizens' Assembly will be set up to examine wider questions on Scotland's future. The SNP is holding its party conference at the weekend Ms Sturgeon is due to address the SNP conference in Edinburgh on Sunday, and has been facing calls from some within her party and the wider independence movement for a referendum to be held sooner rather than later - with some also questioning whether a Section 30 order is needed before a referendum is held. Writing in theScotsman newspaper,externalafter Ms Sturgeon's announcement, SNP veteran Kenny MacAskill - the former justice secretary - claimed that independence supporters who now expect an immediate referendum are ""delusional"". He also accused the SNP of ""fiddling while Rome burns"" and argued that Ms Sturgeon's ""heavily caveated"" statement ""confirmed what many have long thought, which is that she's not planning to try for independence before 2021"". However, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that Ms Sturgeon was trying to keep the country's options open in the face of a Westminster government that does ""not give a damn for the people of Scotland"". He also insisted the SNP leader was ""fulfilling the mandate that if Scotland was taken out of the EU against Scotland's will that we would have a right to have a referendum"". Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year.

"A major wildfire in Moray could be one of the largest seen in the UK for years, according to firefighters. The blaze near Paul's Hill wind farm at Knockando, south west of Elgin,destroyed more than 20 square miles of grassland. Dry conditions and high winds caused the flames to spread aggressively and at its height 80 firefighters were tackling the blaze. Area manager Bruce Farquharson said crews would remain on site for days. And the experienced firefighter, chairman of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, said: ""This is shaping up to be one of the largest wildfires that the UK has seen in years. ""The conditions, including the weather, the terrain and the sheer scale of the incident have made it very challenging. ""This type of incident requires a large amount of resources, and we have called upon the resilience of our national service to tackle it. ""Additionally, we have received additional support from our partners - which includes two helicopters which have been working alongside our crews to tackle the fire in difficult-to-reach areas."" Firefighters have been tackling the blaze Several properties close to the fire have been evacuated as a precaution and the blaze created a large smoke plume which could be seen from space, the fire service said. Mr Farquharson added: ""We are advising people who live in the path of the smoke to keep their windows and doors closed as a precautionary measure. ""Additionally, many roads in the area remain closed and we are asking people to avoid the area for their own safety, and to allow full access for the emergency services."" Police, ambulance and local estate staff joined the fire fighting efforts, along with Forestry Commission staff and local wind farm workers. A huge plume of smoke was billowing across the Moray sky The blaze was burning on four different fronts. The Paul's Hill wind farm, which consists of 28 turbines, is operated by Fred Olsen Renewables. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has been on wildfire alert across Scotland for number of days because of what they described as ""tinder dry"" conditions.

"Asda has overtaken Sainsbury's to become the UK's second-largest supermarket, figures suggest. Asda's sales rose 0.1% in the 12 weeks to 24 March taking its market share to 15.4%,research firm Kantar said.,external In contrast, Sainsbury's sales fell 1.8% over the same period, meaning its market share dropped to 15.3%. The two supermarket groups are currently struggling to persuade the UK competition watchdog to allow their proposed Â£7bn merger to go ahead. Theduo have argued that the tie-upwill save them Â£1.6bn and allow them to pass on Â£1bn in price cuts to savers. They have also agreed to sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. Sainsbury's and Asda offer to sell stores Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade According to Kantar's figures, Sainsbury's was the worst performer of all the big four supermarkets, which includes Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury's sales fall meant its performance lagged behind smaller rivals, such as Iceland and Co-op. Kantar said one reason for Sainsbury's sales slide was that much of its non-food was now sold via catalogue-retailer Argos, which the supermarket group bought in 2016. Argos sales are not included in Kantar's figures. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to expand their reach, with both expanding their market share to 8% and 5.6% respectively in the period. ""Thirteen million households visited Aldi at least once in the past 12 weeks - now more than those shopping at Morrisons,"" said Fraser McKevitt, consumer head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Overall, year-on-year supermarket sales over the 12 week period rose 1.4% - the slowest rate of growth since March last year, which was partly due to the late Easter meaning that Mother's Day fell outside the reported period, Kantar said. Despite Easter being later than usual, Kantar said its data showed that shoppers have already spent Â£146m on Easter eggs this year, while 42% of households had bought hot cross buns.

"The UK government has announced a series of measures to remove the Chinese phone-maker Huawei from the UK's 5G mobile networks. It will ban UK mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and they will have to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The government had previously said Huawei could be involved in the project but it changed its mind following growing security concerns about China. Huawei was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, southern China, by Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer. It started making communications equipment for mobile phone networks and is now a global leader, employing 180,000 workers. Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone supplier after Samsung,external, with 18% of the market - ahead of Apple and others. At the heart of the debate is a simple question: can the West trust Huawei or will using its equipment leave communication networks, and our own mobile phones, vulnerable? The US says Huawei could be used by China for spying, via its 5G equipment. It points to Mr Ren's military background and Huawei's role in communications networks to argue it represents a security risk. Mr Ren was member of China's army, the People's Liberation Army, for nine years until 1983. He is also a member of China's Communist party. Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987 But Huawei says this is not relevant: ""When Ren Zhengfei was a young man, you needed to be a Communist Party member to have any position of responsibility."" Washington has banned US firms from doing business with Huawei (for example, designing and producing chips) and wants its allies to ban it from their 5G networks. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US. For the UK, pressing ahead with using Huawei equipment could have affected vital UK-US trade talks (after Brexit) and the US warned such a decision could risk future security co-operation. But deciding to ban Huawei from 5G in the UK, could risk Chinese retaliation such as a possible cyber attack. Many countries are preparing to move from 4G to more advanced 5G mobile networks. Download speeds 10 times faster than today will radically change how we work, communicate and stream videos. In theory, controlling the tech at the heart of these networks could give Huawei the capacity to spy or disrupt communications during any future dispute. This is important, as more things - from self-driving cars to fridges, baby monitors and fire alarms become connected to the internet. The concern is that state-sponsored hackers could use these devices, which often have weaker security features, as back doors into strategically vital networks. For instance, this could make it possible to shut down a rivals' power stations. But removing Huawei equipment from the networks will have a significant impact on the roll-out of the UK's 5G technology. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be delayed by two to three years and with added costs of up to Â£2bn. The UK has been using Huawei kit since 2005 The US argues China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, which says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"", means Beijing could force Huawei to do its bidding. Huawei says it's never been asked to spy and ""would categorically refuse to comply"". It adds: ""We would never compromise or harm any country, organization, or individual, especially when it comes to cyber-security and user privacy protection."" To monitor the company, the UK set up the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, which comes under the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). In March 2019, it said it hadn't found evidence of malicious Chinese state activity, but it did identify some serious defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security competence. Announcing the ban on 14 July, Mr Dowden said NSCS has now ""significantly changed their security assessment"" of Huawei's presence in the UK's 5G network. He said the decision followed Washington's tougher stance on the company but did not give further details. US buyers will almost certainly favour kit from US companies, such as Cisco, Juniper Networks, or Qualcomm. In Europe, 5G manufacturers include Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Nokia has issued a statement saying: ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed."" The government says it will look at ""multiple vendors"" and will bring forward a Telecoms Security Bill in the autumn. The action does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers. If you use a Huawei phone, it's very unlikely the firm's handing your data to the Chinese government, though it is possible. In the same way, technically, data from a Google Pixel phone could be handed over to the US government. Newer Huawei models like this Huawei Mate 30 Pro won't get Android updates automatically In March last year, Google halted Huawei's licence for Android - the operating system for most of the world's phones, aside from Apple's iPhone. If your Huawei phone was issued before the ban it will receive Android updates, but newer models won't. However Huawei is trying to work around this. As Huawei is from Guangdong province where Cantonese is the main dialect, the firm says its name should be pronounced ""wah-way"". However, some Mandarin speakers argue that the name is pronounced ""hwah-way"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Huawei leak: Minister says he cannot rule out a criminal investigation The culture secretary has said it is possible there could be a criminal investigation into a leak from a National Security Council meeting. Intelligence agencies must be confident that advice given to ministers is kept private, Jeremy Wright told MPs. The Daily Telegraph reported that the NSC had agreed to let Chinese firm Huawei help build the UK's 5G network. Former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the leak was ""too serious"" for a standard Whitehall inquiry. Sir Michael, who was defence secretary between 2014 and 2017, said everyone who was at the meeting should be subject to a ""proper Scotland Yard investigation"", and it was an ""offence to divulge secret information from the most secret of all government bodies, which is the National Security Council"". The NSC is made up of senior cabinet ministers. Chaired by the prime minister, it meets every week to discuss government objectives concerning national security - with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence invited when needed. It is a place where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. All you need to know about Huawei's problemsHuawei: The story of a controversial company What is 5G and what will it mean for you? But following Tuesday's meeting, theDaily Telegraph reported,externalthat the NSC had agreed to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. It also reported that various ministers had raised concerns about the plan. Former National Security Adviser Lord Ricketts told the BBC it was the first time anyone had committed a major leak from the NSC since its inception in 2010. He added that he was in favour of a full inquiry, possibly involving MI5 investigators, ""to make the culprit feel very uncomfortable"". Theresa May's spokesman said national security was ""of the highest importance"" Theresa May's official spokesman declined to confirm whether a government leak inquiry was under way but said: ""The prime minister is clear that the protection of information on matters of national security is of the highest importance."" Earlier, Mr Wright told the House of Commons: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of a criminal investigation here and everyone will want to take seriously that suggestion."" He said security officials ""need to feel they can give advice to ministers, which ministers will treat seriously and keep private, and if they do not feel that they will not give us that advice and government will be worse as a result"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, in addition to the security issue, anger about the leak demonstrated the frustration inside the government at the breakdown of discipline: Allow Twitter content?

For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said: ""If the leak was for an advantage in a Tory leadership race, that would be truly shocking. ""Critical issues of national security should be handled with utmost care, not used as political ammunition in a Tory party civil war."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has denied the leak came from him, saying it was ""utterly appalling"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also denied the leak came from him. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said leaking sensitive information was ""completely unacceptable"" adding: ""If it happens it should absolutely be looked at."" Ministers at the NSC meeting were deciding whether or not to allow equipment from Huawei to be used to construct the new 5G data network - a decision that could have long-term consequences for national security. There are fears that giving the Chinese company a key role could open the UK network to espionage. But Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. According to the Daily Telegraph,external, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The leak from Tuesday's National Security Committee meeting is both serious and unprecedented. Lord Ricketts, a former National Security Adviser in David Cameron's government, confirmed there had never before been a ""major, deliberate leak"" immediately following an NSC meeting. He is in favour of a formal investigation while others go further, calling for a criminal inquiry involving the police and MI5. So, just why is it so serious? Because the NSC is supposed to be the one place in Whitehall where highly sensitive secret intelligence can be openly shared with ministers. Those present will have signed the Official Secrets Act, clearing them to handle secret intelligence. Breaking that ""circle of trust"" risks undermining the work of Britain's three intelligence agencies - GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 - potentially putting agents in danger. Historically, leak inquiries rarely find the culprit, although in this case there may be an electronic trail that would expose the leaker. What they will do, however, says Lord Ricketts, is to put the fear of God up the culprit, thereby discouraging them from ever doing it again. There have beenwarnings in the US since at least 2012that equipment from Huawei poses a security threat. Last year a UK government report said it could provide ""only limited assurance"" that the company's infrastructure did not pose a threat to national security. Now the US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Australia last year blocked its networks from using Huawei's 5G gear. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

"The suspect is a resident of Tenerife A little German boy's testimony led Spanish police to the bodies of his mother and 10-year-old brother in a cave on the island of Tenerife. Police arrested the German father, suspected of killing the two victims. Locals alerted police after finding the distressed five-year-old boy wandering in the mountains near Adeje, muddy and crying, on Tuesday. Spanish media say the German mother and boys had arrived to see the father on Monday. He is a resident on Tenerife. The father was arrested at his apartment, reportedly after a struggle. The victims appear to have been beaten. Spain's Socialist government - facing a general election on Sunday - is treating it as a case of domestic violence and has condemned it on Twitter.Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo called it ""a brutal sexist murder"",external. The Canary Islands are especially popular with German and UK tourists. The police search was hampered by mist on the mountains El PaÃ­s says the cave was found after a long search in mountain mist - the clue was a wristwatch found by a path. The paper quotes sources as saying the father was aggressive and refused to give police any information about his partner and sons. ""It is suspected murder,"" a spokeswoman for the local police (Guardia Civil) told the BBC. The suspect is being held at a police station in Playa de las Americas, near Adeje, and will probably go before an investigating judge on Friday, she said.

Unable to understand German, Rosi said she had fetched a friend, who then translated the boy's story. ""He said he had escaped, run away."" The boy is now in the care of the Canary Islands family welfare service, Spain's Efe news agency reports. The service has contacted a family member, via the German consulate, who is now travelling to Tenerife to meet up with the boy. But officials are leaving it to the judiciary to decide when the boy can return to Germany, as a criminal investigation is under way. A Canary Islands government official, Cristina Valido, said ""although we might be tempted to let the boy return as soon as possible to his normal family life in his country, evidently he witnessed an atrocity and probably it will be the judiciary which decides when he can go home"".

"This video can not be played Ross McEwan says not enough time was spent on customers The chief executive of RBS, Ross McEwan, has resigned after five and a half years in the post. Mr McEwan, aged 61, said that he had ""delivered the strategy"" that he set out when taking over in 2013. Under his leadership the bank, which is 62% government-owned, has closed hundreds of branches, but last year reported a profit of Â£1.62bn, more than double the profit of the previous year. He will remain in the role until a successor has been appointed. ""It is never easy to leave somewhere like RBS. However with much of the restructuring done and the bank on a strong and profitable footing, I have delivered the strategy that I set out in 2013 and now feels like the right time for me to step aside and for a new chief executive to lead the bank,"" Mr McEwan said in statement. When Mr McEwan took over in 2013, RBS was loss-making and had businesses in 30 countries. His strategy was to reduce the size of the bank by withdrawing from overseas markets. Last year, the bank had operations in 12 countries. He also cut costs at the UK banking business, which includes NatWest, by closing branches. In 2014, the bank employed 109,000 staff, but by the end of last year that was down to 67,100. After nine years of losses, RBS returned to profit in 2017 and started paying dividends again last year. Shares have fallen 29% since Mr McEwan took over 1 October 2013. The bank has struggled to improve customer service. In February the Competition and Markets Authority published the results of its latest survey of customer satisfaction. More than 16,000 people were canvassed. RBS came last out of 16 banks when respondents were asked whether they would recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Natwest came 10th. Small businesses were also surveyed and in this category RBS was second-last out of 14 banks, while NatWest came eighth. Speaking to the BBC, Mr McEwan said customers should have received more attention: ""It would have been nicer to have spent a lot more time focusing on the customers of this bank. ""But we found ourselves in some many conduct and litigation-type issues, that we had to get through, and consumed a huge amount of my time."" Douglas Fraser, business editor, BBC Scotland When he stepped up to the top job after running the retail part of RBS, Ross McEwan had instructions from the majority shareholder, the Government, to focus closer to home and to shrink its international reach. So it is now a largely British and Irish bank, making it all the more exposed to the potential Brexit fall-out for its business customers. At the same time, the amiable New Zealander had what he called several ""noisy"" years sorting out multi-billion pound regulatory fines and pay-outs in court cases. There has been the controversy over mistreatment of business clients in financial distress, and political pushback against branch closures. Trying to meet European Commission requirements to shrink the bank by splitting off the Williams & Glyn division has been a time-consuming, expensive failure. And the share price has stuck stubbornly at around half the break-even point for the UK Government's bail-out. Ross McEwan would have preferred to have returned RBS to market disciplines rather than government ones, but the share price has hindered that sale. Through the turmoil of returning to a sustainable profitability, he has tried to keep things simple, using his retail expertise to focus RBS on its customers. That has meant navigating an unprecedented churn in technology, with a rapid shift to apps and online banking. With the finances back in the black, McEwan has acknowledged that turning round the reputational problems for Royal Bank of Scotland is a 10 year project for his successor to see through. With a recent restructure of executive roles, it looks like Alison Rose, currently deputy chief executive of Natwest, has been groomed for the role, though Katie Murray may think differently, having been recently promoted to RBS chief financial officer. Mr McEwan has attracted criticised for his handling of the controversy surrounding RBS's Global Restructuring Group. The Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to a reportby the Financial Conduct Authorityone in six firms transferred to the service were actually damaged by it. Most of the issues occurred before Mr McEwan took over as chief executive. However, Mr McEwanhad to admit that he was wrongwhen he told MPs in 2018 that the GRG unit helped ""the vast majority of businesses it works with"". Last summer RBS agreedto settle a long-running investigation by US authorities into the mis-selling of financial products in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (Â£3.6bn) - making it one of the last major banks to settle cases related to the US mortgage market. The deal paved the wayfor the government to reduce its holding in RBS from more than 70% to 62%. The bank has been majority-owned by the government since it received a Â£45bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008.

"The number of emergency parcels handed out by food banks in Scotland jumped by nearly a quarter over the last year, new figures indicate. The Trussell Trust said its food banks provided more than 210,000 packages to people in crisis in 2018-19. It was a 23% jump from the previous year and the charity described the situation as ""unacceptable"". The UK government said it would be wrong to blame benefit changes or delays for the figures. But the Trussell Trust said the cost of living and delays to benefits were cited by clients as the main reason for them visiting the food banks. Its Scotland operations manager Laura Ferguson said 42% of food bank referrals made due to a delay in benefits were linked to Universal Credit. The Trussell Trust handed out 210,605 food bank parcels last year, compared to 71,428 in 2013-14 She said: ""What we are seeing year-upon-year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. A 200% increase in just five years is not right. ""Ultimately, it's unacceptable that anyone should have to use a food bank in the first place. No charity can replace the dignity of having enough money to buy food. ""Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty. ""Universal Credit should be part of the solution but currently the five-week wait is leaving many without enough money to cover the basics. ""As a priority, we're urging the government to end the wait for Universal Credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households."" Of the 210,605 three-day emergency food supplies given to people in crisis by the trust last year, nearly 70,000 went to children. The total for 2018-19 was a record high. The charity said the main reasons for people needing emergency food were benefits consistently not covering the cost of living (35%), and delays (19%) or changes to benefits (17%) being paid. There are 84 independent food banks operating in 18 Scottish local authorities, with The Trussell Trust operating 52 of them Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity, said: ""It is just wrong that in our society a growing number of people, including children, are going hungry because of our consistent failure to get to grips with poverty. ""When the use of food banks reaches a record high we are beyond the language of warning signs and wake up calls. Unless we take bold action to solve poverty we risk undermining what we stand for as a country."" A Department of Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: ""It is not true to say that people need to wait five weeks for their first payment. Universal Credit is available to claimants on day one. ""It cannot be claimed that Universal Credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth. ""The Trust's own analysis shows a substantial fall in the share of parcels being issued due to benefit payment delays. ""The best route out of poverty is to help people into sustainable employment which, with record employment, we are doing.""

"This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has declared a presidential bid, putting an end to months of speculation. In a video announcement, Mr Biden argued that the ""core values of the nation... our very democracy, everything that has made America America, is at stake"". The 76-year-old, who has already run twice for the presidency, enters a crowded race for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He is up against 19 other hopefuls. They include Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. Mr Biden, who served as President Barack Obama's deputy for two terms, recalled President Donald Trump's much-criticised remark that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the deadly Charlottesville white nationalist riots of 2017. Which Democrat will take on Trump? Joe Biden, the touchy-feely politician ""With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,"" Mr Biden said. ""I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen."" A spokesman for Mr Obama said selecting Mr Biden as his running mate ""was one of the best decisions he ever made"" and the two had ""forged a special bond"", but the former president notably stopped short of an endorsement. A source familiar with Mr Obama's thinking said the former president believed ""a robust primary in 2007 and 2008 not only made him a better general election candidate, but a better president, too"".

Mr Biden, asked by reporters in Delaware why Mr Obama had not endorsed him, replied: ""I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn't want toâ¦ whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits."" President Trump tweeted: ""Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign."" He is the most experienced of the Democratic candidates. A six-term senator, he ran twice unsuccessfully for president - in 1988 and 2008. Mr Biden was tipped to run for president again in 2016, the year Mr Trump was elected, but ruled himself out after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden, from a brain tumour. He has enjoyed relative popularity among Democrats in recent years, consistently leadingevery national poll of the Democratic primary tracked by the website RealClearPolitics,external. Mr Biden is also betting on having the strongest appeal of the Democratic candidates across America's Midwest, where many low-income voters have abandoned the party in recent years in favour of Mr Trump.

But the former vice-president has been forced to address claims he inappropriately invaded the personal space of women. He apologised, saying: ""The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I understand it and I'll be much more mindful."" Joe Biden enters the Democratic presidential contest as a front-runner, if not the front-runner, with huge name recognition and the potential to raise vast amounts of campaign donations. Of course, so did Hillary Clinton in 2015 - and we all know how that turned out. Like the former secretary of state, Mr Biden in his launch video seems to be defining himself as much by who he isn't - Donald Trump - as what he wants to do. It was an oft-criticised strategy for Mrs Clinton in 2016, and also like Mrs Clinton, his lengthy time in the public eye is likely to be picked apart by opponents. The former vice-president has a lot going for him. He also has a lot going against him. The durability of his campaign is one of the big questions hovering over the Democratic race. Joe Biden: Front-runner but with baggage Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was born on 20 November 1942 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, one of four children in an Irish-Catholic family. In 1972, Mr Biden was elected to the US Senate at the age of 29, and took office a few weeks later when he turned 30 - the minimum age to enter the Senate. Just before he took office, he was devastated by tragedy: his wife Neilia and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash. Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia cutting his 30th birthday cake in November 1972 Mr Biden first ran for the presidency in the 1988 election, buthe withdrew after admitting that he had plagiarised a speech by Neil Kinnock,external, the leader of the Labour Party in the UK at the time. After that bid he spent time rising through the Senate ranks, eventually becoming chairman of the judiciary and foreign relations committees. In 2008 he ran for president again, but failed to gain the political traction he needed and dropped out again. Instead, he joined the Obama ticket.

"It is hoped that used coffee grounds could replace the use of palm oil in many household products Two Scottish entrepreneurs are aiming to go global with their hope to replace palm oil using coffee waste. Scott Kennedy and Fergus Moore said they came up with a unique way to extract oil from used coffee grounds which had a wide range of uses. Palm oil is found in many household products, but environmentalists say demand for it is devastating rainforests in Asia. Manufacturers are now under pressure to find an alternative. Mr Kennedy and Mr Moore came up with their idea while working in coffee shops during their time studying business at Glasgow's Strathclyde university, and saw first-hand the amount of food waste in the hospitality industry. Palm oil: Are your beauty products killing orangutans? Warning of palm oil threat to primates Small changes you can make for a greener life Mr Moore told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""About 60% of a cafe's waste is about coffee grounds. ""In Scotland, that amounts to about 40,000 tonnes a year - across the UK, more than half a million tonnes. ""And coffee grounds are so heavy that it takes their waste bill through the roof."" Explaining the idea behind his Revive Eco company, Mr Moore said: ""There are oils in coffee with a wide range of uses in different industries - cosmetics pharmaceuticals, food and drink, household products - you name it, there's probably a use there. ""We're developing a process to extract and purify these oils."" Scott Kennedy and Fergus Moore came up with their business while working in the hospitality sector as students Mr Moore added: ""The most exciting part for us is that they have all the same components as palm. ""Palm oil'sin the news for all the wrong reasons. It's really exciting for us that we could potentially provide a local and more sustainable alternative to all the industries that are currently using palm oil."" Mr Moore said it had been difficult setting up the company because he and his business partner were not from an engineering background, but added: ""We've surrounded ourselves with incredible advisors and mentors that have made the process easier."" Revive Eco has already secured Â£235,000 of funding from the Zero Waste Scotland agency. The entrepreneurs said oil extracted from used coffee grounds could be used in a wide range of household products And now they are in the running for a share of a Â£776,000 funding pot, after it was announced Revive Eco would be representing Scotland and Northern Ireland in the Chivas Venture competition. Twenty global companies are competing for the prize, being announced in Amsterdam in May, after an online public vote. Mr Moore said of the company's ambition: ""We want to have the process up and running in Glasgow by next summer. Longer term, we want to build the business to a place where we can franchise into different countries and replicate the business model elsewhere. ""We'd rather build a new process in Rome, Paris, Berlin - any other big coffee-drinking cities round the world.""

"Prince William met police and medics from St John Ambulance in Christchurch The Duke of Cambridge has met survivors of the Christchurch mosque attacks, in which 50 people were killed in March. The duke also met some of the officers and medics who were among the first at the scene of the shootings. He got a traditional Maori greeting from New Zealand's PM Jacinda Arden at the start of his two-day tour. Meanwhile, the Duke of Sussex, who will soon become a new father, joined the Duchess of Cambridge at an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey. Anzac Day marks the anniversary of the first major military action fought by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) in World War One. Prince William shared in a traditional Maori greeting with New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Arden Prince William performed a hongi with Ms Ardern as he was welcomed in Auckland, before attending a service there.

He then travelled to Christchurch, where he asked officers and medics about how they had put their training into practice. ""Nothing really trains you for seeing it in real life"", said the duke, who has spent time as a pilot with the air ambulance service in East Anglia. ""I'm sure the team pulls together,"" he said. Prince William met some of the first responders to the Christchurch mosque attacks during a visit to the city's Justice and Emergency Services Precinct New Zealand police commissioner Mike Bush said the ""emotion was palpable"" during the visit and the duke was concerned with how those involved were coping a month on from the attacks. ""His main piece of advice was to talk to each other, to not bottle things up - to support each other to talk about what they saw and what they do afterwards,"" he said. Attack victims honoured in Christchurch UK survivor 'cradled woman' in NZ shooting The people killed as they prayed Christchurch: Survivor recounts attack At the police headquarters, dozens of messages from the people of Christchurch were pinned up along the corridors, thanking officers for their work after the shootings. Among them was a card that said: ""You never give up and you never ever will give up trying to save NZ."" Later, the prince had a private meeting with Muslim community leaders, thanking them for bringing the community together after the tragedy. Prince William is travelling on behalf of the Queen at the request of Ms Ardern. She said the visit would ""bring comfort"" as the duke had a ""close connection"" with New Zealand and Christchurch in particular. ""His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community,"" she said. William offered prayers for the Christchurch community and described the attacks as a ""cruel nightmare"".

In 2011, he attended a memorial service after an earthquake killed 185 people. In a speech that day, he said: ""My grandmother once said that grief is the price we pay for love. Here today, we love and we grieve."" The Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge also visited New Zealand in 2014, on their first official tour. While Prince William is in New Zealand, Catherine joined an Anzac service at Westminster Abbey On Thursday afternoon, the Duchess of Cambridge was accompanied by her brother-in-law, the Duke of Sussex, at an Anzac Day Service at Westminster Abbey in central London.

"This video can not be played Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok Russian President Vladimir Putin has said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs international security guarantees if he is to end his nuclear programme. Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, he added, following talks near Vladivostok in Russia's far east. Mr Kim praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange"". Mr Putin said North Korea's leader was ""fairly open"" and had ""talked freely on all issues that were on the agenda"". The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law. ""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said. Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed. According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests. Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around. Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken. There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

"This video can not be played Nequela Whittaker was jailed at 17 - she is now a youth worker Girls involved in gang crime are being overlooked and failed by the authorities, the children's commissioner for England has said. Half of children involved with gangs are girls and they ""desperately need help to get out"", Anne Longfield said. They are often used to carry knives or drugs because they are less likely to be stopped by police, she told the BBC. The Local Government Association said ""limited funding"" meant councils had to prioritise those at immediate risk. Ms Longfield told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was writing to the government and local authorities calling for a review into support for female gang members, who were ""not getting the help they need"". ""Teachers, social workers, GPs and youth workers need to be doing more to help get these girls out of gangs,"" she said. ""So many are trapped with nowhere to go."" Two-thirds of children in England assessed by councils as being involved in gangs are boys (66%) and one third girls (34%), figures analysed by the children's commissioner's office suggest. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics suggest a higher figure - that as many as half may be girls. But the Metropolitan Police Service's gangs matrix database lists 3,000 male gang members known to the authorities in London and just 18 female gang members. And London's deputy mayor for policing, Sophie Linden, said a lot of girls were going ""under the radar"". Anne Longfield is writing to ask the government for a review into how girls involved in gangs are supported Nequela Whittaker, who used to be in a gang but is now a youth worker, said girls as young as 11 were now telling her they carried weapons for ""boyfriends, other counterparts and gang members"". ""As young as these girls are, they are not scared to carry a weapon and if something went wrong to use it,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""They are the ones who are getting away with it, mostly because they are not looked upon as a person of interest, as opposed to a young male."" Until recently, ""Samira"", 18, was a member of a south London gang who had groomed her into carrying weapons from the age of 12. ""It would mostly be kitchen knives, for gang members and for my own protection,"" she said. Asked if she was aware of the harm this could lead to, she replied: ""All you think about is yourself. You don't really care about what happens to the other person. ""All you want to do is protect yourself and you're willing to do anything to do that."" She said she had also seen other girls being sexually exploited by senior gang members. ""I saw people getting stabbed, getting shot, people getting beaten up and getting robbed,"" she said. She is now pregnant, which she said had allowed her to escape gang culture. Police say gender should not be a factor in who is targeted by stop and search Ms Linden, said it was heartbreaking to hear young girls talk about being groomed and abused. ""We are doing our best to engage with those we know about and make sure we are actively reaching out to communities, to ensure we are working with young women and girls who are being exploited. ""We haven't forgotten them."" The Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils across England, said: ""Councils are being forced to divert the limited funding they have left away from preventative work, including young offenders teams and youth work, into services to protect children who are at immediate risk of harm.""

"Knife crime in England and Wales rose to record levels last year, data shows. Police recorded 40,829 offences involving knives or sharp instruments in 2018, up 6% on the year before. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalsaid cases of murder and manslaughter, excluding terror attacks, increased by 12%. There were 732 killings, up from 655 in 2017 - the highest since 2007. The separate Crime Survey, based on people's experiences, points to no significant change in overall crime. The police-recorded knife crime figures come amid a national debate on the issue, following a spate of assaults and killings involving young people. They show these recorded offences are continuing to rise and are at their highest level since 2011 - the year that knife crime statistics started to be gathered in a unified way. However, they show the rate of increase appears to be slowing. Offences rose 9% in the 12 months to September 2018 - after a 13% rise in the 12 months to June 2018. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Reality Check: Is there more crime? London killings: All the victims of 2018 According to the statistics, there was an increase in knife offences recorded in 31 of the 43 police forces in 2018. The Metropolitan Police recorded the most knife offences - 14,660 - representing a 1% yearly rise.  The biggest increase of 54% was recorded by British Transport Police, while Merseyside saw a 35% rise and Dyfed-Powys 28%. The figures show there were 252 killings involving a knife or sharp instrument in 2018. There were 18,950 assaults and 17,402 robberies where a knife or sharp instrument was used. The knife crime statistics do not include Greater Manchester Police because of differences in the way the force has been recording offences. Meanwhile, the number of killings in 2018 last year was at its highest in any calendar year since 2007, when the total reached 765. The Home Office has announced proposals for teachers and NHS workers to help tackle youth crime, as well asmore stop and search powers for police. Policing minister Nick Hurd said recent figures from the Metropolitan Police suggested that action to tackle violent crime was having an impact. He added: ""Law enforcement alone is not the answer which is why our serious violence strategy puts a greater focus on prevention - including by consulting on a proposed new duty to underpin a public health approach to serious violence, and investing over Â£220m in projects to steer young people away from crime."" Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ""The police are completely overstretched and crime prevention work is far too limited. The Labour MP added: ""The Home Office and government response on knife crime and other rising crimes is still far too weak and just doesn't match the scale of the problem."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the recorded crime figures were ""deeply troubling"" and showed ""reckless cuts"" to police forces were having an impact. This video can not be played Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes was killed outside his London school in 2017 - his father Paul Barnes described what happened The police recorded-crime figures also show robberies rose 11% and vehicle thefts 9%. There was 2% fall in firearms crimes in 2018, a total of 6,525 offences. The total number of crimes recorded by police in 2018 was 5.8m, a year-on-year increase of 7%. The data was published at the same time as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime and includes offences that are not reported to police. This video can not be played 'I live in fear of knives' It suggests there was a 12% increase in fraud offences but a 28% decrease in computer misuse and a 3% fall in burglaries. It also suggests there was no overall increase in violent offences. This is in contrast to the police - who recorded a 19% rise in violent offences last year to 1.6m. The Office for National Statistics considers the survey a more reliable indication of such overall trends as it includes lower-level attacks which may not be reported to police. Alexa Bradley, from the Office for National Statistics, said: ""It is important to look at each crime type separately because the picture is very mixed. ""Even within crime types we have seen differences... Lower-volume high-harm violence involving knives has risen, whereas offences involving firearms have decreased."" The figures were issued on the same day theHome Office separately released statistics showing that the number of crimes solved by police,externalin England and Wales has fallen to a new low. Last year, 8.2% of offences led to a suspect being charged or summonsed to appear in court. That was down from 9.1% in 2017 - and the lowest charge rate since the figures were first compiled in this way in 2015. In 45.7% of cases, no suspect was identified, slightly down on the year before - and incidents where a victim was unable or decided not to support further action accounted for 22.4%.

"Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to NI The government must address the lack of clarity about abortion law in Northern Ireland as it is creating confusion, fear and inequality, a report has said. The House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee scrutinised what impact the absence of an executive was having on developing policy. It heard from witnesses including doctors, nurses, lawyers and women who spoke from personal experience. Anti-abortion groups have said the recommendations undermine devolution. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - split in a bitter row over aflawed green energy scheme. Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said a government at Stormont should deal with the abortion issue. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained According to the report the absence of an executive means there is: No devolved government to respond to significant developments No scrutiny bodies to make sure policies are working well No scrutiny of the use of UK government funds for women and girls seeking abortion in England A failure to respond to international human rights obligations The report highlights that since the Stormont government collapsed, there had been several significant developments relating to abortion. These include: A UN committee finding""grave"" and ""systematic"" breaches of women's rights The UK Supreme Court identifyinga breach of human rights in relation to cases of fatal foetal abnormalityor where the pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest The introduction of UK government fundingfor women and girls to access free abortion services in England The report calls for the government to set out a timetable within the next six months so that an individual victim, such as a victim of rape or incest, does not have to take a case to court. Committee chairwoman Maria Miller said the report ""sets out action which the government must take to address"" the lack of clarity. Ms Miller said: ""The situation of a woman or girl who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest having to pursue a court case highlights precisely why it should not depend on an individual victim to take a case to court. ""This must be rectified urgently."" Christian Action Research and Education (Care) said abortion was a devolved matter and the report was suggesting that devolution be ""bypassed"". ""The issue of abortion law in Northern Ireland should be decided by the people of Northern Ireland through their elected representatives and not by MPs sitting on a Westminster committee,"" said Care's chief executive Nola Leach. ""There's no doubt that the issue of access to abortion where an unborn child has been diagnosed with a life-limiting condition deemed fatal before, during or shortly after birth is hugely sensitive. ""But the proper place for a discussion about this is at the assembly in Northern Ireland."" The Commons' committee also found there was uncertainty about the legality of doctors in Northern Ireland referring patients to the government-funded scheme, which provides free abortions in England. It said there could be a conflict between healthcare professionals' duties to their patients and the law as it currently stood. During its inquiry, the committee focused on the working of the law as it currently stands for people in Northern Ireland, and on how it relates to the UK's international obligations. It did not set out to examine the ethical, religious and moral issues surrounding abortion. 30 November 2015:A High Court judge in Northern Irelandrules Northern Ireland's law breached the European Convention on Human Rightsin cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime 11 February 2016:Members of theNorthern Ireland Assembly vote against legalising abortionin cases of fatal foetal abnormality (by 59 votes to 40) and cases of sexual crime (by 64 votes to 30) 14 June 2017: Supreme Courtrejects an appeal by an anonymous mother and daughterthat NI women should be able to access free NHS abortions in England. 29 June 2017:Northern Ireland's Department of Justice (DoJ) and Attorney Generalsuccessfully appeal against 2015 High Court human rights ruling, prompting the NIHRC to go to the Supreme Court 29 June 2017:The government announceswomen from Northern Ireland will be entitled to free NHS abortions in England, after a Labour-led campaign 7 June 2018: Supreme Court rejectsappeal that argues Northern Ireland law is incompatible with international human rights The report recommends that the Government Equalities Office should publish its legal advice on the scheme funding access for women and girls from NI to abortions in England. It added that the Department of Health for Northern Ireland should reissue guidance for health care professionals making it clear that referring patients to the funded scheme is not unlawful. Ms Miller said: ""We heard of doctors facing a potential conflict between their duty of care to their patients and the law, and between their duty of confidentiality and the law. ""They still have not been given guidance on referring women to the UK government scheme providing free abortions in 2017. ""This must be published immediately."" Amnesty International UK and the Family Planning Association welcomed the report and called on the UK government to take immediate action. Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland campaign manager, said: ""The committee has made clear that the government is responsible for delivering urgently-needed change on abortion and calls for a timeline and framework to be set out. ""Devolution does not relieve the UK government of their obligation to protect and promote the rights of women in Northern Ireland.""

"Daphine Aikens runs a food bank charity in west London that feeds 300 people each week Baked beans, tinned fish and canned fruit are carried out of a church in west London by neatly-dressed people in their 30s and 40s. They do not fit any stereotype of what poverty should look like, but these are among the rising numbers of people turning to food banks. The UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, gave 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year. This was more than ever before and a 19% annual increase. The food bank in St Matthew's Church in Fulham is one of three sites run by Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank, a charity which feeds about 300 people a week. It is in an area of London where million-pound houses are not unusual, only a short walk from the luxury developments of Chelsea Harbour. The people coming to the food bank are often ""embarrassed and ashamed, they don't want to be here"", says Daphine Aikens, the charity's chief executive. Much of the food distributed has been donated through supermarkets But they are coming in growing numbers, with almost a threefold increase in three years. Each person will have their own complicated reasons - but the common denominator, she says, is simply running out of cash. ""They just do not have enough to live on,"" says Mrs Aikens. This can be low pay, low benefits, delays to universal credit, interruptions in earnings, illness, unexpected costs, debts, rent arrears, rising utility bills... but in the end, it comes back to a lack of money. ""The tipping point between coping and not coping can be pretty abrupt,"" says Mrs Aikens. These are people living on a financial tightrope, with just about enough to get by each week, with no ""rainy day"" reserves, who can be pushed into serious difficulties by a big bill or a gap in income. There are so many stories here. A pensioner who got a ridiculously big bill, but who paid it rather than make a fuss, and then found himself without anything left. A woman whose financial problems began when trying to escape domestic violence. A couple whose work did not pay enough. A woman who faced a penalty charge from the NHS and was self-harming. ""Poverty is very hidden, but it is very real,"" says Mrs Aikens. The Trussell Trust figures show that people on benefits are the most typical recipients, but a significant proportion of three-day food supplies, about 320,000, go to people in work. People using the food bank have usually been referred there by other services, such as GPs, schools or social services Mrs Aikens says it is important to welcome people and give them ""dignity"" when they come to the food bank. The food has been donated, often through supermarkets, and those collecting it have been referred by other services, such as Citizens Advice, GPs, schools and children's services. If there is a risk of such handouts being exploited by scroungers, queuing for a bag of pasta and tinned peaches seems like a fairly low-gain fraud. Amber Rudd links universal credit to food bank use Newcastle food bank feeds 46,000 Who really goes to a food bank? Those arriving often bring other problems, including depression and anxiety - and food banks are turning into mini-welfare and advice centres. St Matthew's is offering access to psychotherapy sessions, along with consumer and legal advice, holiday clubs for families and training sessions on cooking and budgeting. ""What we are seeing year upon year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. This is not right,"" says the Trussell Trust's chief executive Emma Revie. There are now about 2,000 food banks across the UK, with the Trussell Trust accounting for about 1,200 of them. The number of supplies being distributed has risen by 73% over the past five years. The amount of supplies distributed by food banks in the UK has increased by 73% over the past five years The trust puts particular blame on the benefits system - in particular delays in payments during the transition to universal credit. This is rejected by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which says there is no delay for claimants. ""It also cannot be claimed that universal credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth,"" said a DWP spokeswoman. Whatever the reason, the idea of food banks would once have seemed out of place in the UK, but John Griffiths, a volunteer and trustee at St Matthew's, says without them ""people would be on the streets begging"". Researchers from University of Oxford and King's College London tried to identify the typical users of food banks, in a major study a couple of years ago. They found the most frequent recipients were single men, lone mothers with children and single women - between them accounting for about two-thirds of all food bank users. It was usually people of working age, middle-aged rather than young or old, mostly living in rented accommodation. Almost nine in 10 were born in the UK. These food bank users were living in ""extreme financial vulnerability"" and might have a life of missing meals, often for days at a time, going without heating and electricity. About five out of six were without a job and depending on benefits - and those in employment were usually in insecure, low-paying work. Who really goes to a food bank?

"This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee A reward of up to Â£10,000 has been offered for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. Ms McKee, 29, was shot in the head last Thursday while observing rioting in Londonderry, and hundreds of mourners attendedher funeral on Wednesday. Police said the Crimestoppers reward might help ""assist in efforts to get justice for Lyra and her loved ones"". A dissident republican group, the New IRA, has said its members killed her. A spokesman for Crimestoppers - a charity which takes calls confidentially via a telephone or using an anonymous online form - said the murder had sent ""shockwaves"" across Northern Ireland and attracted ""global condemnation"". In pictures: Mourners pay respects Profile: Lyra McKee Det Supt Jason Murphy said police had received ""widespread public support to date"" - more than 140 people have already contacted investigatorsvia the Major Incident Public Portal.,external ""I want to find the people who murdered Lyra and the information that can help us bring Lyra's killer to justice lies within the local community,"" he said. ""People saw the gunman - people know who is responsible. I'm asking them to come forward and help us."" Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter and that was reflected during the funeral service Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were among the congregation at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. Mourners heard that Ms McKee revealed plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Priest Fr Martin Magillreceived a standing ovation when he asked why it took her death to unite political parties. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in sat side-by-side in St Anne's Cathedral Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she intends to hold discussions with Stormont's party leaders this week in a bid to restore power-sharing, following the murder of Ms McKee. Northern Ireland has been withouta functioning devolved government since January 2017. However, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has said he is not convinced that the murder of Ms McKee has marked a turning point. Mr Wilson told BBC News NI that Mrs Bradley would ""get nowhere"" if she ""continues to simply talk to people"". Jonathan Ireland, Crimestoppers board member, explained the process to Good Morning Ulster ""Someone out there knows exactly who killed Lyra but they haven't come forward yet because they're scared. They don't want to ""tout"" or get retribution. ""We're putting up this reward with a clear message - you don't need to be frightened. ""You are anonymous. We aren't the police - we are totally separate and when you call the 0800 number or website you are anonymous. ""You'll never be asked your name or address and we cannot trace your number or IP address. ""This is a very high profile murder case that has sent shockwaves across Northern Ireland and the world. ""It's really important this information comes forward and it hasn't and so the decision was taken that a reward would be offered. ""It has been done in the past and it has been successful."" DUP leader Arlene Foster, who held talks with the NI secretary and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Wednesday, said she wanted to see the government ""take steps"" to ensure talks commence. She added that the DUP wanted to see the assembly restored immediately, alongside a time-limited process dealing with outstanding issues. The DUPsuggested this as a way of breaking the deadlockback in September 2017, butat the time it was rejected by Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""ready to play our full part in a serious and meaningful talks process which removes obstacles to power-sharing, delivers rights and restores the assembly"". ""Sinn FÃ©in wants to see the full restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,"" she said. She said Sinn FÃ©in had told Mrs May and Mr Varadkar ""that the current situation of stalemate of no executive or assembly is untenable and cannot continue"". ""The two governments should now meet with urgency through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to provide solutions to the outstanding rights issues, which are at the heart of sustainable power-sharing,"" she added.

The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law. ""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said. Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed. According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests. Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around. Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken. There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

"Gisda chief executive Sian Elen Tomos faces a number of claims she bullied former staff Ten former employees at a homeless charity have said the chief executive's behaviour led them to leave their jobs. Since 2011, seven managers and three members of staff have left Gisda, with many claiming to have been bullied. The board of directors at the charity, based in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said it had confidence in the ability of Sian Elen Tomos. The youth charity is ""committed to creating a healthy work space for its entire staff,"" the board added. The BBC has spoken to 10 former Gisda employees who claim Ms Tomos's managerial style was the reason they left. None were willing to do an interview publicly - but one agreed to speak anonymously. Eileen - not her real name - said Ms Tomos ""could make people feel very uncomfortable"". ""Not taking into account what anyone else said, ignoring people and making it obvious in front of other people, turning her back on you as you were speaking to her and walking away,"" she explained. ""I've seen her walking out of a number of meetings. She would not speak to people for days. Not speaking at all. And she could be nasty to people too. ""I think she worked on people's weaknesses - bullying, really."" Gwynedd charity Gisda supports young homeless people She said she felt ""sick"" and ""felt for her friends"". ""I didn't want to go to work,"" she added. ""I think it affected young people too. They could see so much turnover. ""There was a feeling that she was untouchable. If anyone disagreed with her she got rid of them - or worked to get rid of them."" A letter sent to the board of directors and seen by the BBC shows a number of staff complained about the situation in 2017. The BBC understands only three formal complaints have been made since 2011, but a number of former staff said they did not complain formally because they felt they would be ignored. The letter noted staff felt ""suspicious, dispirited, anxious and angry"", and the charity needed to act decisively if the board wished ""to avoid a morale crisis"". The letter finished by calling on the board to ""consider the high level of staff turnover in the organisation"". A letter seen by the BBC shows staff feared a ""morale crisis"" at Gisda Later in 2017, an independent report was commissioned by the charity in response to the grievances of two managers. The BBC has seen a copy of the report, which states the grievances of the two previous managers and the complaints made by the chief executive about her staff, were partly upheld. Acknowledging further issues at Gisda, the report made a number of recommendations. These included to arrange mediation between Ms Tomos and the two former managers and the board should review its complaints procedures so complaints were acted upon and not ignored. According to Eileen, who left months after the independent report was published, the recommendations were not acted upon. Four other former members of staff who left after the report was published agreed. To see positive change, Eileen said the charity should appoint a new board of directors and chief executive. The charity's board of trustees said it had confidence in Ms Tomos Ms Tomos and the chairman of the board of directors, Tudor Owen, were given the opportunity to respond separately to the claims. In a response on behalf of the pair, the board of trustees said it took ""any suggestion of bullying or wrongdoing seriously as it was against the inclusive ethos that was created"". The statement added the board had ""complied with their legal obligations"" and the matters raised ""had been given appropriate internal attention"". In conclusion, the board said it had full confidence in Ms Tomos. A Gwynedd Council statement said Gisda received funding from the authority to provide services to support young homeless people and, as part of the contract, it was regularly ""monitored and scrutinised"". ""We will be asking Gisda that none of the matters that have been raised recently affect their contract with the council in any way,"" it said.

"This video can not be played 'One boy told the whole class I wore a nappy' ""One boy told the whole class I wear nappies. Everyone looked at me and I could feel my cheeks go red."" For Gruff, double incontinence has made some days at secondary school an anxious and humiliating experience. Campaigners claim there is a lack of support in Wales, estimating that 1 in 10 UK children suffer bedwetting, daytime accidents and constipation. The Welsh Government said it expected health boards to provide specialist-led continence services for under-19s. ""I don't want to be wet,"" said Gruff (not his real name). ""I want to stay dry like my other friends do and never have to go to the toilet and change my pad and have a wee."" Gruff's mother says his condition has had a ""real impact"" on his behaviour. ""I just don't think he can cope with it mentally,"" she says. ""And as a result, his behaviour sometimes is really difficult to manage. ""He's rightly very angry, very frustrated. ""He doesn't want to be the only kid in his class who wears nappies."" Campaigners say children are suffering in silence Guidelines from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say that people with bladder and bowel problems from birth to 19 years old should have access to integrated, community-based paediatric continence service led by a specialist nurse. In 2017, just one of the seven Welsh health boards provided the recommended service, according to a Freedom of Information inquiry by a campaign group, the Paediatric Continence Forum. Across the UK, the figure was 41% - two out of every five equivalent bodies. 'I don't think he can cope, mentally' One in 50 teenagers 'wet the bed',external Bedwetting caused by 'problem in brain',external Research by BBC Wales suggests the situation in Wales has improved recently to reflect the UK average, with three health boards - Aneurin Bevan, Betsi Cadwaladr, and Cardiff and Vale - saying they provide the recommended service. The other four boards said children were supported through a range of services such as school nurses, physiotherapists and consultants. However, Dr Penny Dobson, founder and chair of the Paediatric Continence Forum, claimed there was a ""failure"" of provision and the situation still needed ""radical improvement"". Dr Penny Dobson says children can be bullied over bedwetting ""I think many will be suffering in silence,"" she said. ""It's a neglected area of child health but the effects on the child and the family - if it's not addressed at an early stage - can be devastating."" ""Continence problems have a known link with mental health difficulties,"" Dr Dobson added. ""Children can feel different, it affects their self-esteem, they can't always go on social activities and it affects them at school. Bullying is a problem for many children with continence problems."" If not properly assessed and treated, Dr Dobson said children could also end up in A&E with serious constipation, or kidney problems caused by urinary tract infection. Where the full service provision does exist in Wales, parents claim it is overstretched. The problem can lead to anxiety for some children Bethan (not her real name) is also in her first year at secondary school and has bladder incontinence which has led to anxiety problems. ""Only one friend knows, she's really close. If I tell another friend she'll probably tell everyone,"" she says. ""Everyone will start asking - I don't want to go through that hassle."" Her mother says: ""For young people, living with this is horrendous. There's nothing funny about it.  It affects their quality of life and they need support. ""Bethan has had times where's she's refused to go to school, leave the house or go anywhere because she's hiding. That's heartbreaking."" She adds: ""There's not enough funding, not enough staff, not enough counselling services for children with bladder and bowel problems. ""It's really important to remember that the children go to the clinic every couple of months and that's the only chance they get to offload, to cry, to laugh and to bond with the health professional. ""It's just so important to children's general wellbeing."" Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said youngsters should have the same level of support wherever they live. ""If 40% of the health boards in Wales can meet the NICE guidelines, then there's no reason why the others can't as well,"" she said. Ms Holland added that families had contacted her with complaints about the lack of support in school. ""That reinforces the fact that this not just an issue in the home, it's an issue wherever the child goes,"" she said. The Welsh Government said it expected health boards to deliver services in line with NICE guidelines.

"Around 12 million hectares of forest in the world's tropical regions were lost in 2018, equivalent to 30 football fields per minute. While this represents a decline on 2016 and 2017, it is still the fourth highest rate of loss since records began in 2001. Of particular concern is the continued destruction of what are termed primary forests. An area of these older, untouched trees the size of Belgium was lost in 2018. Amazon deforestation 'worst in 10 years' Are UK barbecues fuelling deforestation? Can these seedballs solve Kenya's deforestation crisis? TheGlobal Forest Watch,externalreport paints a complex picture of what's going on in the heavily forested tropical regions of the world that range from the Amazon in South America, through West and Central Africa to Indonesia. The forests of the Amazon basin are home to an estimated 20 million people. Among them are dozens of tribes living in voluntary isolation. As well as providing food and shelter, the trees in these regions are important to the world as stores of carbon dioxide and play a key role in regulating global climate change. Millions of hectares of these forests have been lost in recent decades, having been cleared by commercial or agricultural interests. The data from 2018 shows a drop from the previous two years, which saw a huge amount of trees lost to fire. However, those involved in the research say this good news is somewhat qualified. ""It's really tempting to celebrate a second year of decline since peak tree-cover loss in 2016,"" said Frances Seymour from the World Resources Institute, who run Global Forest Watch. ""But if you look back over the last 18 years, it is clear that the overall trend is still upwards. We are nowhere near winning this battle."" Primary forests are those that exist in their original condition and are virtually untouched by humans. Sometimes referred to as old growth forests, these areas can harbour trees that are hundreds, even thousands, of years old. They are critical to sustaining biodiversity, and are home to animals including jaguars, tigers, orang-utans and mountain gorillas. These old forests really matter as stores of carbon dioxide, which is why the loss of 3.6 million hectares in 2018 is concerning. ""For every hectare of forest loss, we are one step closer to the scary scenarios of runaway climate change,"" said Frances Seymour. Unfortunately not! Back in 2002, Brazil and Indonesia made up 71% of tropical primary forest loss.  In 2018, these two countries accounted for 46%. The Democratic Republic of Congo is now the country with the second largest losses by area, while countries like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru all saw increases in primary forest disappearance. Colombia continued the dramatic rise first seen in 2016. It's been linked to the peace process in the country where areas of the Amazon once held by FARC guerrillas have now been opened up to development. Madagascar lost 2% of its entire primary forest in 2018. That was more than any other tropical country. The disappearance of these trees is causing ""heartbreaking losses in real places"", said Frances Seymour. ""All too often the loss of an area of forest is also associated with a funeral because every year hundreds of people are murdered when they try to stop the miners, loggers, ranchers and other commercial interests from appropriating their forest wealth - the moral imperative to act on these numbers is unquestionable and urgent."" Cocoa farming in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire has played a role in forest loss Countries including Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire showed the highest rise in percentage terms in losses of primary forest. Ghana saw a whopping 60% increase while Cote d'Ivoire saw a 26% rise. Most of this increase, particularly in Ghana, is likely to be due to small-scale gold mining. There has also been an expansion of cocoa farming. Campaigners are concerned that the rise comes despite pledges made in 2017 by leading cocoa and chocolate companies to end deforestation within their supply chains. Surprisingly, yes. Indonesia has worked hard to prevent forest fires starting not just to extinguish them Indonesia managed to reduce primary forest losses in 2018 by around 40%, its lowest rate since 2003. The decline is due to a number of factors, including two wet years that limited the fire season. However, government action has also played a strong role. Protected areas saw big declines in deforestation, while an agreement with Norway to compensate the country for cutting emissions from tree-felling has also made a difference. ""Our law enforcement is another policy that shows we take it seriously,"" said Dr Belinda Margono, from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry. ""In the country, there are several companies that have been punished or have had a letter from the government, so we are really trying on law enforcement."" Experts say it is too early to tell if changes to environmental laws brought in by President Jair Bolsonaro have made any difference. The country experienced a major drop in deforestation between 2007 and 2015, by around 70%. Fires in 2016 and 2017 saw a rise once again. While 2018 was lower, at 1.3 million hectares, it was still above the historical level. Global Forest Watch notes that in 2018 several hotspots of primary forest loss occurred near or within indigenous territories. The Ituna Itata reserve, home to some of the world's last un-contacted tribes, saw more than 4,000 hectares of illegal clearing. The Global Forest Watch data has been updated by the University of Maryland. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

"This video can not be played Nearly a third of those referred for help were because benefits did not cover living costs Food bank referrals have passed a record 100,000 in Wales in the last year, a charity has reported. The Trussell Trust has seen the number of food parcels it gives out across the country rise by just over 43% in five years. Nearly a third of people were referred for help because benefits did not cover the cost of living. The Department for Work and Pensions denied that benefit changes were driving the use of food banks. Susan Lloyd-Selby, Wales operations manager for the Trussell Trust in Wales, said: ""We are seeing record numbers of people in Wales walking through the doors of food banks because they simply cannot afford food. ""This isn't right.  No one should be left hungry or destitute, and we owe it to each other to make sure sufficient financial support is in place when we need it most."" The charity said more than 113,000 three-day emergency food supplies were given to people in crisis in Wales between April 2018 and March this year. The latest end-of-year figures also show a 15% rise in emergency food parcels for children over the last 12 months. People needing help have to receive a voucher from community organisations, including schools, GPs, housing and advice agencies. The charity said the main reasons for people needing emergency food were: Benefits consistently not covering the cost of living (32%) Delays (23%) or changes (18%) to benefits being paid 51% of food bank referrals made due to a delay in benefits being paid in Wales were linked to Universal Credit. The charity wants an end to the five-week wait for a first Universal Credit payment, saying it was leaving many without enough money to cover the basics. ""As a priority, we're urging the government to end the wait for Universal Credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households,"" said Ms Lloyd-Selby. What is Universal Credit? Who really uses food banks? Food bank user 'never felt so low' 'My five-year-old searched bins for food' Across the UK, nearly 1.6m food parcels were given out in 2018-19 A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokeswoman said: ""It is not true to say that people need to wait five weeks for their first payment. Universal Credit is available to claimants on day one. ""It also cannot be claimed that Universal Credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth."" The spokeswoman said the Trussell Trust's own analysis showed a ""substantial fall"" in the proportion of parcels being issued due to benefit payment delays. She said that the best route out of poverty was to help people into sustainable employment ""which, with record employment, we are doing"". The DWP added that for those who needed a safety net, Â£10bn had been invested in Universal Credit since 2016, while the benefits freeze would end next year. The Trussell Trust says the five-week wait for a first Universal Credit payment leaves many without enough money to live on. But the DWP says people do not need to wait that long. So do people claiming Universal Credit have to wait or not? Technically, they're both right. There is a five-week wait for the first payment but you can apply for an advance loan. So, if your first estimated payment is Â£251.77 you can ask for the same amount - or less - as an advance. However, that has to be paid back - and if you choose to spread the payments over the maximum time of one year, this would cost you Â£20.98 a month which would be deducted from your monthly Universal Credit payments. And Â£20 a month is a lot of money to pay back if you're on a low income. You can also be refused an advance if you live with your parents or friends, or have savings, for example.

"This video can not be played Jilly Moss's one-year-old daughter contracted measles weeks before she was due to be vaccinated The mum of a baby who had measles so severely that ""her eyes were swollen shut for four days"", says ""parents should know what can happen to vulnerable babies"". Jilly Moss's daughter Alba spent eight days seriously ill in hospital. She was not old enough to have had the first dose of the MMR vaccine. More than half a million children in the UK missed out on the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, the children's charity Unicef says. Globally, 169 million children did not receive the first dose of the measles vaccine over the same seven-year period. There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show. It comes as NHS chief Simon Stevens warned that people rejecting vaccines was a ""growing public health time bomb"". Alba, who is now one and over the worst, was unwell for a couple of weeks with a high temperature and rash, before it spread and covered her entire body. At one point, after deteriorating in hospital in south London, Jilly did not think her daughter would survive. ""It was absolutely terrifying to watch her go through that and be so helpless. ""She didn't know what was going on and it was heartbreaking to see,"" she says. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs, eyes and brain. In one in 25,000 cases, brain complications can be fatal. Alba Moss developed a rash with measles that covered her whole body Babies and children with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications - more common ones include diarrhoea and vomiting, lung infections and fits caused by a fever. Millions of lives worldwide have been saved by the measles vaccinations given to young children - but too many are still dying, Unicef says. Health experts say children should have two doses of the vaccine to fully protect against the disease. In many countries, including the UK,the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella (or German measles).,external the first dose is given to babies around their first birthday the second dose before starting school, when three to four years old But, according to Unicef, a mixture of complacency, misinformation, scepticism about immunisations, and a lack of access to jabs has led to inadequate vaccination rates globally. It estimates that between 2010 and 2017: The US topped the list for the number of unvaccinated children in high-income countries, with 2,593,000 missing the first dose of the vaccine The comparable figure for France was 600,000 The UK came third, with 527,000 children not getting their first dose of the vaccine over the seven-year period In Nigeria, four million children under one did not get the first dose of the vaccine The figures are based onUnicef and World Health Organization,externalestimates of the number of children immunised against diseases in 194 countries in 2017. Figures for the second dose of the measles vaccine ""were even more alarming"", Unicef said. It found 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had not introduced a second dose, putting more than 17 million infants a year at a greater risk of getting measles as a child. In 2017, 85% of children worldwide were vaccinated with the first dose but only 67% with the second dose of the measles vaccine, Unicef says. This video can not be played ""My daughter's life was destroyed by measles"" Henrietta Fore, executive director at Unicef, said: ""The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. ""If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."" Prof Beate Kampmann, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the figures as a ""wake-up call."" She said: ""Measles is highly infectious, even before the typical rash appears, so you cannot simply 'keep away'. ""We must protect children and communities against this potentially very serious but entirely preventable infectious disease - and the only way to do that is through vaccination."" Anti-vaccine views wrong - chief doctor Measles cases hit record high in Europe Global measles resurging, WHO warns Measles - the disease that returned from the past Public Health England said though the overall risk to the public in England was low, unimmunised people were in danger of catching the disease while outbreaks continued in Europe. This video can not be played The BBC investigated in 2018 why there's been a measles outbreak in Europe Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease so far this year, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, while a spike in case numbers has been reported in the US and Thailand. In Greater Manchester,more cases have been recorded this year than in the whole of the previous two years combined. NHS chief Simon Stevens has warned that""vaccination deniers"" have been gaining traction on social media, leading to the spread of misleading information. The Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, has called for new legislation toforce social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines.

"The proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda has been blocked by the UK's competition watchdog over fears it would raise prices for consumers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also said,externalit would raise prices at the supermarkets' petrol stations and lead to longer checkout queues. Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe said the regulator was ""effectively taking Â£1bn out of customers' pockets"". But he said the supermarkets had agreed to end the deal. Asda boss Roger Burnley said he was disappointed: ""We were right to explore the potential merger with Sainsbury's, which would have delivered great benefits for customers and supported the long term, sustainable success of our business."" The deal would have created the UK's biggest supermarket chain, accounting for Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries. Sainsbury's and Asda had said the planned tie-up would have cut their costs, allowing them to lower prices for consumers across the UK. Analysts also believed it was designed to help the two supermarkets counter the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in the increasingly competitive grocery market. But the CMA, which had previously raised concerns about the deal, said the merger would lessen competition at both a national and local level. Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600. This video can not be played The CMA's Stuart McIntosh says the deal would have reduced competition Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It would reduce competition in supermarkets and online grocery shopping and at the companies' petrol stations. ""We think that is likely to lead to higher prices or other changes which would be unwelcome to shoppers, such as longer checkout queues."" Earlier this year, Sainsbury's and Asda, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, promised to sell between 125 and 150 of their supermarkets to allow the merger to proceed, along with some petrol stations and convenience stores. They also pledged to bring in Â£1bn of price cutsfor consumers if the deal went ahead, and be held to this by an independent guarantor. Sainsbury's said the CMA had ignored this offer, and misunderstood the potential impact on competition. But the CMA said it had conducted surveys of 60,000 of the supermarkets' customers. ""Those promises were based on cost savings which we don't think are likely to be realised. Also those price promises are very likely to be difficult to track in practice,"" Mr McIntosh said. Next Wednesday is shaping up as the most important day of Mike Coupe's professional life. The chief executive of Sainsbury's has today seen his big gambit, a merger with Asda, fail - and fail utterly. Now he needs to come up with a convincing Plan B, and demonstrate to a sceptical market how Sainsbury's can prosper without what would have been a transformational deal with Asda. If he cannot do that, he will probably have to stand down. Now the companies have said the deal is off, Mr Coupe's task next Wednesday is two-fold. First there is the subtle task of coming up with a new commercial strategy for Sainsbury's as a standalone company, without it looking like there is anything wrong with the current one. This will be difficult given he has spent months explaining why the Asda deal is so necessary, and in the meantime faced accusations that the day-to-day management of the chain is not up to scratch. This will require money - investment in stores and price cuts - and this is his second job. How can Sainsbury's pay for all this and maintain its all-important dividend payments to shareholders? Asda has a different problem. It needs a new owner as its American parent, Walmart, has made it clear it wants out. That could mean a sale to a private-equity investor, or a stock market listing. Neither would be straightforward. Shares in Sainsbury's fell almost 6% following the news, despite many having expected the CMA's decision. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""This returns the focus to the UK grocery market, which is highly competitive, and now both businesses will need to concentrate their energies on reinvigorating and perhaps re-imagining their individual offerings to shoppers."" The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said the ruling was good for jobs. GMB general secretary Tim Roache said: ""Swathes of stores and depots would have to have been sold off, with jobs put at risk and no real benefit for customers or communities. ""The workforce has been through months of uncertainty, worrying about what's going to happen and wondering if their stores or depots would be sold from under them."" Ian Giles, competition partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, called the CMA's ruling ""controversial in competition law circles"". ""It suggests a higher bar than had been the case in previous retail mergers. The parties perhaps underestimated how the scale of this deal, and the CMA's focus on consumer markets, meant they would face such serious obstacles in securing approval.""

"Measles cases in Europe tripled between 2017 and 2018 to 82,596 - the highest number recorded this decade,data from the World Health Organization,externalshows. While vaccination rates are improving, the WHO says coverage is not high enough to prevent circulation of the virus in many countries. Ukraine reported the highest number of measles cases last year - more than 10 times that of the next highest, Serbia. Over 90% of cases were in 10 countries, including France, Italy and Greece. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. There were 72 deaths from measles in Europe in 2018 compared with 42 in 2017. The European countries with the highest number of measles cases from January to December 2018 were: Ukraine (53,218) Serbia (5,076) Israel (2,919) France (2,913) Italy (2,517) Russian Federation (2,256) Georgia (2,203) Greece (2,193) Albania (1,466) Romania (1,087) In the UK, there were 953 measles cases last year. Meanwhile, Ukraine had the highest rate of measles cases in Europe, at 1,209 per one million population - 10 times the country's rate in 2017. Why is there a measles outbreak in Europe? And this largely explains the sharp rise in total cases in Europe, from 25,863 in 2017 to more than 82,000 in 2018. Vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella in Ukraine fell sharply over a number of years during itsconflict with Russia, reaching 31% in 2016 - among the lowest in the world. By the end of 2017, the percentage of children in Ukraine who had been vaccinated had significantly improved, to about 90% but, the WHO says, this now needs to be sustained to protect the population from further outbreaks of measles. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, said: ""The picture for 2018 makes it clear that the current pace of progress in raising immunisation rates will be insufficient to stop measles circulation. ""While data indicate exceptionally high immunisation coverage at regional level, they also reflect a record number affected and killed by the disease. ""This means that gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus."" The WHO says the 2018 surge in measles cases followed a year when European countries achieved their highest ever estimated coverage for the second dose of the measles vaccination - 90%. The percentage of children receiving the first dose of the vaccine also increased, to 95%.

"Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock wants new legislation to force social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines. He said the government is working with internet companies to identify misleading material on jabs, including Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR). Artificial intelligence programmes could root out bad science. MMR vaccine uptake rates are declining in many countries. The reason is not clear. Rates dipped in the 1990s following publication of a report linking MMR to autism, but partly recovered after that research was discredited and disproved. However, the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has been swelling in recent years, sparking concern that it is having a negative impact. Vaccination deniers gaining traction, NHS boss warns UK 'eliminates measles' for first time 'Don't be taken in by anti-vaccine myths on social media' Mum of woman disabled by measles on responsibility to vaccinate Mr Hancock told the BBC's Today programme: ""We are looking at legislating for the duty of care that social media companies in particular have towards the people on their sites - this is an important part of that duty of care alongside all the other things that social media companies need to do, like tackling material that promotes suicide and self-harm and, of course, terrorism."" In a statement Facebook, which owns Instagram, said: ""We are working to tackle vaccine misinformationâ¦by reducing its distribution and providing people with authoritative information on the topic."" Measures to be taken, according to the company, include rejecting ads with misinformation about vaccines and not showing misleading content on hashtag pages. Measles is highly infectious and can cause serious health complications, including damaging the lungs and brain. There have been measles outbreaks in parts of the US.Rockland County in New York State,externalhas declared a State of Emergency in response to the outbreak there. Anyone who is under 18 and unvaccinated will be barred from all public places until the declaration expires in 30 days or they get the MMR vaccine.  Breaches of the order will result in a fine and a six month jail sentence. In January officials in Washington State announced measures to help local areas worst affected by the virus. There were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018 - the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017. Health chiefs in Greater Manchester reported a sharp increase in measles cases between January and March 2019, the majority in unvaccinated children. In England, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has fallen over the last four years to 87.2%. This is below the 95% said to provide ""herd immunity"", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are given to children before they start school in the UK Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, believes anti-vaccination campaigns are damaging and should be vigorously resisted: ""I don't like it that bad science is pushed to parents - I don't like quackery - I want them to know the truth that vaccines are very safe that have been used for decades"". Jo Walton was sceptical about vaccinations when her daughter Sarah was due to receive her first jab. But Sarah contracted measles before the date of the injection. The family thought no more of it until Sarah was 24 and was diagnosed with a degenerative neurological condition directly linked to the earlier measles infection. Sarah is now bedbound and needs 24-hour care. Jo has become a committed campaigner for the MMR jab: ""It upsets me greatly that here we are 14 years after Sarah's diagnosis and people seem as ill-educated about the consequences of childhood illnesses as I was back in 1980."" But, faced with a barrage of claims and counter-claims on social media, its not surprising that some parents are confused. The question is whether health experts should try to win them over by striving to win that battle rather than setting out to remove material deemed to be damaging and inaccurate. Dr Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, argues that there is a danger with what may be perceived as censorship and, she says, the focus should be on winning hearts and minds. ""What you have is a spectrum of people, some for whom its an obvious thing to get their child vaccinated, others at the other end who will never be convinced, and, in the middle, perfectly intelligent, sensible people who are not certain what do and its that group of people we need to treat with respect and provide them with information. ""Social media can be both a positive and a negative thing in that. Clumsy-handed censorship I don't think is the way forward,"" she said. As the chief medical officer put it, the UK's health system is not an island when it comes to the spread of viruses. Social media and infectious diseases are global phenomena. No wonder the World Health Organisation has declared the anti-vaccine movement to be one of the top global health threats for 2019.

"""Outdated"" age-specific benefits for older people should be replaced with support for the young to ""deliver a fairer society"", say peers. The Committee on Intergenerational Fairness,externalurged ministers to focus on housing and training, rather than benefits like free TV licences. Committee chair Lord True said failing to rebalance policies could risk the ""strong bond"" between the generations. But campaigners warned against changes, saying pensioner poverty was rising. How housing has divided the young Free TV licence recipients 'richer' Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The committee - made up of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers - issued a raft of recommendations, both to ""retain the supportive relationship between generations"" and to plan for the ""100-year life"" that younger people can expect to become the norm. Suggested improvements include: Ensuring local authorities have specific planning policies to meet the housing needs of younger and older people Increasing training funding for young people who don't go to college or university Making sure those who work for the ""gig"" economy -getting paid per ""gig""- have the same rights as other workers The peers also propose changes to benefits for older people, including: Removing thetriple lock for pensions,which raises the basic state pension by the rate of average earnings increases, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is higher Phasing outfree TV licencesbased on age (currently free for over-75s) and ensuring the government decides on whether to give free licences based on household income Limiting free bus passes for the over-65s and winter fuel payments until five years after retirement age Conservative peer Lord True said: ""Both young and older people recognise the contribution the other makes and the challenges they face. ""However, there is a risk that those connections could be undermined if the government does not get a grip on key issues such as access to housing, secure employment and fairness in tax and benefits."" Life expectancy in the UK is currently 82.9 years for women and 79.2 years for men. But with technological revelations, medical breakthroughs and societal shifts, it is thought that an age expectancy of 100 is not far away. While living a healthy life for longer may appeal, it changes the way governments will need to prepare. The London Business School,externalsays the current life stages of education (between the ages of five and 21), work (22-65) and retirement (65+) will cease to exist. This means people may need to retrain, work for longer or need more care in their later stages of life. As a result, many aspects of the government's remit will be affected, such as housing, health, education and pensions, and the committee says its recommendations will help them get ready. The committee said intergenerational unfairness was being ""exacerbated"" by an ageing population, the 2008 global financial crisis and successive government policies that have failed to consider the issue. According to its report, many pensioner households are now, on average, better off than their working age counterparts, both in terms of income after housing costs and overall household wealth. ""We are calling for some of the outdated benefits based purely on age to be removed,"" said Lord True. He said the universal benefits were ""justified when pensioner households were at the bottom of the income scale, but that is no longer the case"". Allow YouTube content?

"A DNA test of a cancer tumour could provide huge amounts of information Scientists at Glasgow University have developed a cancer testing technique that they say could transform the way we treat the disease. The medical team based at The Glasgow Precision Oncology Laboratory are able to extract huge amounts of information from tiny fragments of DNA. The information could identify the type of cancer tumour as well as any genetic variations and its resistance to drugs. It could even point to a cancer patient's prognosis. It is what is known as ""precision medicine"", because it could allow doctors to match treatments to individual patients. Prof Andrew Biankin said cancers that might look similar under the microscope are different at a genetic level Andrew Biankin, regius professor of surgery at Glasgow University, said that it was all about ""getting the right treatment to the patient at the right time"". Prof Biankin, an international expert in genetic research and precision oncology, said methods of measuring differences in disease have been ""relatively crude"". He said: ""In cancer we use a microscope to look at the differences in what we see in the individual cells, that gives us a certain granularity. ""So we can group things to a certain degree but many of the treatments we use don't work in most patients."" The DNA from cancer tumour is broken down into fragments that can be targeted for analysis Prof Biankin said the treatments might work in 20% or 30% of patients but they never know that ahead of trying them. ""We don't want to wait three months or six months to say 'oh dear it's not working, lets try something different',"" he said. ""In a disease like pancreatic cancer, six months might be the end, so we need to be able to select which treatment comes first."" The professor said cancers that might look similar under the microscope are different at a genetic level. ""It makes sense that if we are trying new treatments we should try to match it to the underlying genetics, or molecular pathology as it is called, of an individual's cancer,"" he said. The test was originally developed to help understand the make-up of pancreatic cancer where fewer than three in every 100 patients will live for five years. Prof Biankin and his team sequenced genes to understand which particular type of pancreatic cancer a patient had. Now the laboratory is sequencing DNA samples from all types of solid tumours to improve understanding of the disease. Not only will that help the patient but it will also allow data to be collected in a standardised way. That will improve research and enable people to access new treatments. In the laboratory, scientists enlist the help of a robot to sort and filter DNA samples from a patient's biopsy. It is able to extract the 1% that is relevant to cancer. After that the samples are sequenced and powerful computers analyse the data. Dr Susie Cook said she hoped all cancer patients would get the genomic test Dr Susie Cook, the head of medical genomics at GPOL, explains that it would take a team of people days just to extract the relevant fragments of DNA. Having a robot do the work means they can test more than 90 samples in one go. With about 80 people diagnosed with cancer every day in Scotland she believes the potential for this test is a game-changer. Dr Cook said: ""I really hope well within five years time every patient who is diagnosed with cancer will get one of these all-encompassing genomic tests. ""They'll get it early in their care pathway so it's one of the first things that happens once they are diagnosed with cancer and it will allow them to use that information and their doctors to use that information every step of the way."" The goal has been to develop a test readily available to all NHS patients. Genomic testing of cancer is generally a difficult and expensive option accessible to only a few. But the university says what is different here, is that this test is comprehensive, practical and affordable - a few hundred pounds rather than in the thousands. It is about to be piloted by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with health boards across the UK and internationally also in talks about bringing this tiny but potentially revolutionary test to a hospital near you.

"This video can not be played Edinburgh has seen a surge in visitors using Airbnb Rooms available to book on Airbnb have rocketed in number in major UK cities, leading to fears of ""hollowed out communities"" as tourists flock in. Data analysed by the BBC suggests that listings in Edinburgh doubled in three years, and shows a fourfold increase in spaces in London since 2015. City of Edinburgh Council has called for licensing and London councils want a registration scheme for hosts. Airbnb said it led the way on ""clear and proportionate"" rules. ""Airbnb is the only platform that voluntarily works with UK cities to help hosts share their homes, follow the rules and pay tax. Other platforms and providers need to step up and follow our lead,"" the company said. ""[The platform] allows local families and businesses to benefit from visitors to their communities."" Nearly 80,000 rooms or homes in London are listed on Airbnb - more than any other UK city, according to figures from housing advocacy site Inside Airbnb analysed by the BBC. Just over 12,000 are listed in Edinburgh, but the effect is greater than in London as this accounts for a much bigger proportion of the city's property and population. Edinburgh's 12,000 listings work out to around one Airbnb listing for every 42 residents, while London's Airbnb market equates to one listing per 112 residents. Much of this accommodation is centred around Edinburgh's Old Town - a huge draw for tourists especially during the annual Fringe festival. Airbnb said its activities had boosted the Scottish economy by Â£1.5m a day, and the UK economy as a whole by Â£3.5bn last year. One result has been concern among locals and politicians of a squeeze on housing for residents, the behaviour of some visitors in residential blocks, and differing tax treatment for traditional hotels and guesthouses. Examples of anti-social behaviour in ""party flats"" have been highlighted by campaigners for greater regulation. They included loud, late-night noise affecting one young woman's exam preparation, and an amorous couple bursting into the home of a resident aged in her 80s before realising they had the wrong flat. Councils say it is expensive and time-consuming to tackle such problems with their existing powers. They can only do so after complaints, rather than proactively. What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood - the picture worldwide Council leader sets out Airbnb licensing wish list ""Short term lets are having a terrible impact. They are hollowing out communities, both in the city centre and increasingly across Edinburgh. Residents are putting up with high levels of anti-social behaviour and, very worryingly for us, we believe there is a huge impact on housing supply,"" said Councillor Kate Campbell (SNP), housing convenor at City of Edinburgh Council. ""Housing in Edinburgh is under enormous pressure and we need to take every action we can to protect supply and keep homes affordable for residents, as well as protecting communities."" The Scottish government has been asked to consider a licensing scheme - allowing for checks, safety requirements, and the potential for a cap on numbers. Housing Minister Kevin Stewart (SNP) said it was considering what measures could be required, which would be put to consultation ""to ensure we get the balance of short-term lets right in Scotland"". He said there would be a further announcement within a week. Airbnb said it took action when alerted to rare cases of bad behaviour, pointed out that hosts are subject to income and council taxes, and said it welcomed regulation. However, it also argued that its growth had little effect on the availability of homes for locals to buy or rent, highlighting various studies which had shown that house building had not kept up with demand, and had pushed up prices as a result. It said entire home listings on Airbnb represented less than 0.6% of the available housing stock in Scotland, and some listings on its site were bed and breakfasts, or small hotels, rather than residential property. One of the most popular areas for Airbnb listings in the country is Shoreditch, in London. Its reputation for a thriving nightlife and cultural scene means many listings in the area advertise their ""trendy"" location. The result is the common sight of visitors ""hanging around with Google Maps on their phones"", trying to find their accommodation which could be good for trade, according to local trader Phil Blackman. Graffiti suggests not everyone is happy with the attraction of Shoreditch to tourists Mr Blackman sells shoes just off Brick Lane and says Airbnb has encouraged people to come to the area. ""It is good value for money for them, and they have got to stay somewhere,"" he said. He argued that people working in finance in the City and living there for only a year or two, while offering little to the area, were more responsible for any loss of community spirit. The debate is reflected in one piece of graffiti. ""Tourist go home,"" it says, but underneath someone has added: ""But we love this place"". Many tourists applaud Airbnb for the opportunity to visit cities without paying large city hotel rates. Many homeowners join the chorus, saying the income from occasionally letting a spare room helps pay the bills. However, concerns have been raised that landlords have shifted from offering long-term tenancies to these short-term lettings, restricting supply for people who want to live and work in these cities and putting up the cost of rent as a result. Nearly half of listings come from hosts with more than one property, and in London, 24% of listings are by hosts with five or more sites. It is a similar picture in Manchester and Bristol, according to the Inside Airbnb data. One per cent of hosts control 17% of the London's Airbnb market. In Bristol and Edinburgh, 1% of hosts are responsible for 11% of listings, and in Manchester it is 10%. In London, there are 11 Airbnb hosts with more than 100 listings each. Eight of the 11 are listed with human-sounding host names, like ""Sally"", offering 279 listings, ""Veronica"" (195), and ""Emily"" (179). Airbnb argued that all three identified themselves, basically as property managers. It said hosts may manage the listing process on behalf of a number of different individuals. A 90-day a year short-term let limit for whole homes has been in operation in London since 2015. Owners wishing to let for longer may require planning permission for a ""change of use"" from their local council. Only six changes from a home to a hotel have been approved since the limit was introduced, according to Freedom of Information requests the BBC sent to 32 London boroughs. Airbnb is currently the only platform to have voluntarily implemented the 90-day limit automatically on its platform. The Mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan, wrote in March 2017 to six other online short-term letting platforms operating in London - Veeve, Onefinestay, Wimdu, Booking.com, HomeAway and Airsorted - urging them to follow Airbnb's lead. Homeaway and TripAdvisor have committed to introducing a cap in the future, but other providers have not. This 90-day rule can be easy to flout,London councils told the BBC in 2017. The Mayor of London said on Tuesday that the law was ""near-impossible for councils to enforce"". Mr Khan has now called on the government to introduce a new registration system for anyone wanting to rent out a property for less than 90 days a year - to make it clear who is operating in this sector. Airbnb is supporting this idea. It said it had a team that worked to prevent, detect, and tackle attempts to avoid night limits, and suggested other providers had failed to follow suit. Outside London, planning is more of a grey area. If the property is primarily a home, with a room to let, then planning permission is probably not needed. A planning authority can determine whether there has been a material change of use. A certification scheme for all types of short-term accommodation is operating in Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK which has one.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: I want to see an end to high bus fares Labour is pledging to spend Â£1.3bn a year to reverse cuts to 3,000 bus routes and fund the expansion of new services in England. During a visit to Nottingham, Jeremy Corbyn said services have been ""devastated"" by austerity. The Campaign for Better Transport said local authority bus budgets have been cut by 45% since 2010. But ministers said they spent Â£250m a year directly on services, including some that otherwise wouldn't be viable. Labour said its policy, launched a week before local council elections across England, would be funded by revenue from Vehicle Excise Duty. In a speech, Mr Corbyn said bus services are a ""lifeline"" for many people and cuts to services in the past decade have had ""disastrous consequences for our towns and city centres and for air pollution and the environment"". 'Buses are my connection to everything' 'Why we drive our own buses' Bus journeys fall by 90 million ""Bus networks are essential for towns and cities and for tackling rural poverty and isolation, which is why Labour is committed to creating thriving bus networks under public ownership."" Labour says the policy complements its plan to put communities in control by bringing local services into public ownership, and introducing free bus fares for young people under the age of 25. Outside London, buses are largely run by private companies, which make their money from passenger fares. The government said buses were ""vital for connecting people"" so it subsidises costs by about Â£250m every year Local councils pay subsidies to plug gaps in services, often in rural areas where running a route is more expensive or less lucrative for companies. Nearly half of all bus routes in England receive partial or complete subsidies from councils. The Local Government Association has warned these services are at risk as local authorities will struggle to maintain current levels of support unless they are given more funding. Department for Transport figures show the number of local bus passenger journeys in England fell by 85 million, or 1.9%, to 4.36 billion in the year ending March 2018. Labour's plans were welcomed by trade unions but the Conservatives said the opposition had ""already spent the pot of money they claim would fund this proposal"". Marcus Jones, the party's vice chair for local government, said motorists would end up being ""clobbered""  and funding for road repairs slashed to pay for the proposal. Bus route decline is 'national crisis' Reality Check: Does your council have to keep the buses running? ""Along with their plans to put politicians in Westminster in charge of running local bus services, their pledge to slash funding for roads and their calls to increase fuel duty, this just proves they are not on the side of hardworking families who rely on their vehicles,"" he said. VED is forecast to raise about Â£7.1bn in revenues in 2021-2022. The government has said some of this money will be ring-fenced to pay for road building but Labour has said sustainable transport schemes will also be backed. The Liberal Democrats said they agreed with Labour that additional bus funding is needed, but ""much more needs to be done"". The party's transport spokeswoman Jenny Randerson added: ""Targeting funding in the right areas is vital, particularly in rural areas where people can be cut off"". The Liberal Democrats say they would give young people aged 16-21 a two-third discount off bus fares. Co-leader of the Green Party, Sian Berry, also said Labour was right to reverse the cuts but urged them to commit to scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail project. ""This would free up tens of billions of pounds to be invested in transforming bus and train services in hundreds of towns and cities across the UK,"" she said. In a response, the Department for Transport said: ""Buses are vital for connecting people, homes and businesses which is why we help subsidise costs by around Â£250m every year and support local authority spending. ""Local authorities spend a further Â£1bn on the free bus pass scheme, benefiting older and disabled people across the country. ""We have also recently published our plans to make bus travel more convenient for passengers by ensuring better access to real-time information on fares, routes and services.""

"This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee A reward of up to Â£10,000 has been offered for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. Ms McKee, 29, was shot in the head last Thursday while observing rioting in Londonderry, and hundreds of mourners attendedher funeral on Wednesday. Police said the Crimestoppers reward might help ""assist in efforts to get justice for Lyra and her loved ones"". A dissident republican group, the New IRA, has said its members killed her. A spokesman for Crimestoppers - a charity which takes calls confidentially via a telephone or using an anonymous online form - said the murder had sent ""shockwaves"" across Northern Ireland and attracted ""global condemnation"". In pictures: Mourners pay respects Profile: Lyra McKee Det Supt Jason Murphy said police had received ""widespread public support to date"" - more than 140 people have already contacted investigatorsvia the Major Incident Public Portal.,external ""I want to find the people who murdered Lyra and the information that can help us bring Lyra's killer to justice lies within the local community,"" he said. ""People saw the gunman - people know who is responsible. I'm asking them to come forward and help us."" Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter and that was reflected during the funeral service Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were among the congregation at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. Mourners heard that Ms McKee revealed plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Priest Fr Martin Magillreceived a standing ovation when he asked why it took her death to unite political parties. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in sat side-by-side in St Anne's Cathedral Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she intends to hold discussions with Stormont's party leaders this week in a bid to restore power-sharing, following the murder of Ms McKee. Northern Ireland has been withouta functioning devolved government since January 2017. However, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has said he is not convinced that the murder of Ms McKee has marked a turning point. Mr Wilson told BBC News NI that Mrs Bradley would ""get nowhere"" if she ""continues to simply talk to people"". Jonathan Ireland, Crimestoppers board member, explained the process to Good Morning Ulster ""Someone out there knows exactly who killed Lyra but they haven't come forward yet because they're scared. They don't want to ""tout"" or get retribution. ""We're putting up this reward with a clear message - you don't need to be frightened. ""You are anonymous. We aren't the police - we are totally separate and when you call the 0800 number or website you are anonymous. ""You'll never be asked your name or address and we cannot trace your number or IP address. ""This is a very high profile murder case that has sent shockwaves across Northern Ireland and the world. ""It's really important this information comes forward and it hasn't and so the decision was taken that a reward would be offered. ""It has been done in the past and it has been successful."" DUP leader Arlene Foster, who held talks with the NI secretary and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Wednesday, said she wanted to see the government ""take steps"" to ensure talks commence. She added that the DUP wanted to see the assembly restored immediately, alongside a time-limited process dealing with outstanding issues. The DUPsuggested this as a way of breaking the deadlockback in September 2017, butat the time it was rejected by Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""ready to play our full part in a serious and meaningful talks process which removes obstacles to power-sharing, delivers rights and restores the assembly"". ""Sinn FÃ©in wants to see the full restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,"" she said. She said Sinn FÃ©in had told Mrs May and Mr Varadkar ""that the current situation of stalemate of no executive or assembly is untenable and cannot continue"". ""The two governments should now meet with urgency through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to provide solutions to the outstanding rights issues, which are at the heart of sustainable power-sharing,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok Russian President Vladimir Putin has said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs international security guarantees if he is to end his nuclear programme. Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, he added, following talks near Vladivostok in Russia's far east. Mr Kim praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange"". Mr Putin said North Korea's leader was ""fairly open"" and had ""talked freely on all issues that were on the agenda"". The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law. ""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said. Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed. According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests. Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around. Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken. There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

"Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez of Manchester United are among the top-paid players in the Premier League Premier League clubs' wage bill rose by 15% to Â£2.9bn in the 2017-18 season, hitting profits - despite them making record revenue during the campaign. Having five teams each reaching at least the last 16 of the Champions League helped push revenue to Â£4.8bn, according to analysis from Deloitte. But the high transfer fees paid out by clubs also helped push up wages. That brought profit before tax down to about Â£400m for the clubs, a reduction from about Â£500m a year earlier. Tim Bridge, a director in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""The increased wage expenditure was expected given the busy transfer market in the 2017-18 season, with two record transfer windows driving estimated Premier League gross spend of Â£1.9bn."" However, he said, broadcast fees are only likely to rise by a small amount in the next three years. ""With the emphasis now on clubs to generate revenue growth from sources other than central broadcast distributions, it may be that we see the levels of pre-tax profit diminish over the next few years,"" he said. The ""big six"" clubs of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham accounted for 89% of the league's pre-tax profits, according to financial data firm Vysyble. They earned more than Â£53.4m a week between them, up from Â£48.4m the previous season, while the other 14 sides made a combined Â£39.4m a week, down Â£200,000 on the year before. Premier League clubs paid out more than Â£260m to football agents in the 12 months to the end of January 2019, an increase of Â£49m on the previous year, according to documents released by the Football Association. Liverpool were the highest-spending club in the top flight, paying Â£43m to agents in that period. Chelsea (Â£26m) and Manchester City (Â£24m) were the next biggest spenders.

He then travelled to Christchurch, where he asked officers and medics about how they had put their training into practice. ""Nothing really trains you for seeing it in real life"", said the duke, who has spent time as a pilot with the air ambulance service in East Anglia. ""I'm sure the team pulls together,"" he said. Prince William met some of the first responders to the Christchurch mosque attacks during a visit to the city's Justice and Emergency Services Precinct New Zealand police commissioner Mike Bush said the ""emotion was palpable"" during the visit and the duke was concerned with how those involved were coping a month on from the attacks. ""His main piece of advice was to talk to each other, to not bottle things up - to support each other to talk about what they saw and what they do afterwards,"" he said. Attack victims honoured in Christchurch UK survivor 'cradled woman' in NZ shooting The people killed as they prayed Christchurch: Survivor recounts attack At the police headquarters, dozens of messages from the people of Christchurch were pinned up along the corridors, thanking officers for their work after the shootings.

"This video can not be played Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok Russian President Vladimir Putin has said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs international security guarantees if he is to end his nuclear programme. Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, he added, following talks near Vladivostok in Russia's far east. Mr Kim praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange"". Mr Putin said North Korea's leader was ""fairly open"" and had ""talked freely on all issues that were on the agenda"". The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law. ""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said. Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed. According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests. Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around. Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken. There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

"Daphine Aikens runs a food bank charity in west London that feeds 300 people each week Baked beans, tinned fish and canned fruit are carried out of a church in west London by neatly-dressed people in their 30s and 40s. They do not fit any stereotype of what poverty should look like, but these are among the rising numbers of people turning to food banks. The UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, gave 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year. This was more than ever before and a 19% annual increase. The food bank in St Matthew's Church in Fulham is one of three sites run by Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank, a charity which feeds about 300 people a week. It is in an area of London where million-pound houses are not unusual, only a short walk from the luxury developments of Chelsea Harbour. The people coming to the food bank are often ""embarrassed and ashamed, they don't want to be here"", says Daphine Aikens, the charity's chief executive. Much of the food distributed has been donated through supermarkets But they are coming in growing numbers, with almost a threefold increase in three years. Each person will have their own complicated reasons - but the common denominator, she says, is simply running out of cash. ""They just do not have enough to live on,"" says Mrs Aikens. This can be low pay, low benefits, delays to universal credit, interruptions in earnings, illness, unexpected costs, debts, rent arrears, rising utility bills... but in the end, it comes back to a lack of money. ""The tipping point between coping and not coping can be pretty abrupt,"" says Mrs Aikens. These are people living on a financial tightrope, with just about enough to get by each week, with no ""rainy day"" reserves, who can be pushed into serious difficulties by a big bill or a gap in income. There are so many stories here. A pensioner who got a ridiculously big bill, but who paid it rather than make a fuss, and then found himself without anything left. A woman whose financial problems began when trying to escape domestic violence. A couple whose work did not pay enough. A woman who faced a penalty charge from the NHS and was self-harming. ""Poverty is very hidden, but it is very real,"" says Mrs Aikens. The Trussell Trust figures show that people on benefits are the most typical recipients, but a significant proportion of three-day food supplies, about 320,000, go to people in work. People using the food bank have usually been referred there by other services, such as GPs, schools or social services Mrs Aikens says it is important to welcome people and give them ""dignity"" when they come to the food bank. The food has been donated, often through supermarkets, and those collecting it have been referred by other services, such as Citizens Advice, GPs, schools and children's services. If there is a risk of such handouts being exploited by scroungers, queuing for a bag of pasta and tinned peaches seems like a fairly low-gain fraud. Amber Rudd links universal credit to food bank use Newcastle food bank feeds 46,000 Who really goes to a food bank? Those arriving often bring other problems, including depression and anxiety - and food banks are turning into mini-welfare and advice centres. St Matthew's is offering access to psychotherapy sessions, along with consumer and legal advice, holiday clubs for families and training sessions on cooking and budgeting. ""What we are seeing year upon year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. This is not right,"" says the Trussell Trust's chief executive Emma Revie. There are now about 2,000 food banks across the UK, with the Trussell Trust accounting for about 1,200 of them. The number of supplies being distributed has risen by 73% over the past five years. The amount of supplies distributed by food banks in the UK has increased by 73% over the past five years The trust puts particular blame on the benefits system - in particular delays in payments during the transition to universal credit. This is rejected by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which says there is no delay for claimants. ""It also cannot be claimed that universal credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth,"" said a DWP spokeswoman. Whatever the reason, the idea of food banks would once have seemed out of place in the UK, but John Griffiths, a volunteer and trustee at St Matthew's, says without them ""people would be on the streets begging"". Researchers from University of Oxford and King's College London tried to identify the typical users of food banks, in a major study a couple of years ago. They found the most frequent recipients were single men, lone mothers with children and single women - between them accounting for about two-thirds of all food bank users. It was usually people of working age, middle-aged rather than young or old, mostly living in rented accommodation. Almost nine in 10 were born in the UK. These food bank users were living in ""extreme financial vulnerability"" and might have a life of missing meals, often for days at a time, going without heating and electricity. About five out of six were without a job and depending on benefits - and those in employment were usually in insecure, low-paying work. Who really goes to a food bank?

"""Outdated"" age-specific benefits for older people should be replaced with support for the young to ""deliver a fairer society"", say peers. The Committee on Intergenerational Fairness,externalurged ministers to focus on housing and training, rather than benefits like free TV licences. Committee chair Lord True said failing to rebalance policies could risk the ""strong bond"" between the generations. But campaigners warned against changes, saying pensioner poverty was rising. How housing has divided the young Free TV licence recipients 'richer' Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The committee - made up of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers - issued a raft of recommendations, both to ""retain the supportive relationship between generations"" and to plan for the ""100-year life"" that younger people can expect to become the norm. Suggested improvements include: Ensuring local authorities have specific planning policies to meet the housing needs of younger and older people Increasing training funding for young people who don't go to college or university Making sure those who work for the ""gig"" economy -getting paid per ""gig""- have the same rights as other workers The peers also propose changes to benefits for older people, including: Removing thetriple lock for pensions,which raises the basic state pension by the rate of average earnings increases, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is higher Phasing outfree TV licencesbased on age (currently free for over-75s) and ensuring the government decides on whether to give free licences based on household income Limiting free bus passes for the over-65s and winter fuel payments until five years after retirement age Conservative peer Lord True said: ""Both young and older people recognise the contribution the other makes and the challenges they face. ""However, there is a risk that those connections could be undermined if the government does not get a grip on key issues such as access to housing, secure employment and fairness in tax and benefits.""

But with technological revelations, medical breakthroughs and societal shifts, it is thought that an age expectancy of 100 is not far away. While living a healthy life for longer may appeal, it changes the way governments will need to prepare. The London Business School,externalsays the current life stages of education (between the ages of five and 21), work (22-65) and retirement (65+) will cease to exist. This means people may need to retrain, work for longer or need more care in their later stages of life. As a result, many aspects of the government's remit will be affected, such as housing, health, education and pensions, and the committee says its recommendations will help them get ready. The committee said intergenerational unfairness was being ""exacerbated"" by an ageing population, the 2008 global financial crisis and successive government policies that have failed to consider the issue. According to its report, many pensioner households are now, on average, better off than their working age counterparts, both in terms of income after housing costs and overall household wealth. ""We are calling for some of the outdated benefits based purely on age to be removed,"" said Lord True. He said the universal benefits were ""justified when pensioner households were at the bottom of the income scale, but that is no longer the case"". Allow YouTube content?

However, The Centre for Ageing Better warned against ""tinkering"" with existing benefits, saying pensioner poverty was increasing for the first time in a decade. ""This is not about old versus young,"" said its chief executive, Dr Anna Dixon. ""It is about creating a society where everyone, regardless of income or background, can enjoy every stage of life. ""Headline-grabbing proposals like abolishing free TV licences based on age risk distracting from the big structural changes needed across housing, work and communities."" But David Sinclair, director of the International Longevity Centre, said policymakers had failed the young. He said: ""Our approach to public policy at the moment risks pitching younger against older people and inadvertently and unhelpfully undermining the intergenerational contract. ""Today's young are tomorrow's older people.""
