"Durham student Matthew Hedges has been held in solitary confinement for five months, his wife says A British student has been charged with spying for the UK government in the United Arab Emirates. Matthew Hedges was accused of ""spying for and on behalf of a foreign state"", the UAE government said on Monday. The 31-year-old PhD student at Durham University was arrested on 5 May in Dubai and hasreportedly been held in solitary confinement for five months. His wife Daniela Tejada has called on the UK government to deny he was spying for them. Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip. A family spokeswoman said he had been accused of spying for the UK government while in the UAE to interview sources about the country's foreign policy and security strategy. In a statement, the UAE government said: ""The attorney general of United Arab Emirates confirmed today that Matthew Hedges, a British citizen, has been charged with spying for and on behalf of a foreign state, jeopardizing the military, economy and political security of the UAE."" Daniela Tejada says she is worried about her husband's mental health Ms Tejada, who lives in Exeter with her husband, said she had seen reports he would go on trial for spying and would appear in court next week, but had not received official confirmation from the UAE or the Foreign Office. ""I no longer know what to do to get Matt out of prison in the UAE,"" she added. ""I am calling on the UK government to clarify publicly that Matt is innocent of the charges and that there have been many falsehoods said about him. ""It is the duty of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to protect their citizens abroad. ""This horrifying situation has been going on for far too long."" Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Ms Tejada claimed her husband had not received ""appropriate medical care and attention, especially in regard to his mental health"" during his time in solitary confinement. ""Since he was detained he has only ever been granted two consular visits which is in direct violation of his rights."" She described Mr Hedges, who was researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy, as ""a man of integrity and principle"". The Foreign Office said it was providing support, while Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had raised ""a number of concerns"" about the case with his UAE counterpart.

"Allen announced his diagnosis earlier this month Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft, has died aged 65 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He had revealed the disease's return only two weeks ago, after previously being treated for it in 2009. He had said he and his doctors were ""optimistic"" about treatment. His Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: ""I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends... Personal computing would not have existed without him."" In a statement confirming his death on Monday afternoon, his sister Jody described the businessman as a ""remarkable individual on every level"". ""Paul's family and friends were blessed to experience his wit, warmth, his generosity and deep concern. For all the demands on his schedule, there was always time for family and friends,"" the statement said. ""At this time of loss and grief for us - and so many others - we are profoundly grateful for the care and concern he demonstrated every day."" The businessman made his fortune alongside school friend Bill Gates, after they co-founded technology giant Microsoft in 1975. ""From our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend,"" said Mr Gates. ""He deserved much more time, but his contributions to the world of technology and philanthropy will live on for generations to come. I will miss him tremendously."" He left the company in 1983 following his first diagnosis of the blood cancer Hodgkin's disease, but recovered to become a successful venture capitalist with his media and communications investment firm, Vulcan that he set up in 1986. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco I've spent Monday at the 25th anniversary of technology magazine Wired, an event celebrating the history of not just the magazine, but technology itself. Paul Allen, who will be deeply missed by those here, was one of the industry's giants. His name would have been on Wired's pages many, many times. Mr Allen had beaten cancer before, and he had appeared confident that he could beat it again. Those close to him said he was active, on emails at least, until the very end - offering advice, strategy and insight to the many, many people who looked to him for support. Mr Allen didn't always have a great relationship with his co-founder, Bill Gates. The pair had a well-publicised row over stock ownership. But they shared an awful lot in common, first as children learning programming, and then as adults donating billions to philanthropic efforts. Mr Allen's investment firm confirmed news of his death on Monday evening. ""Millions of people were touched by his generosity, his persistence in pursuit of a better world, and his drive to accomplish as much as he could with the time and resources at his disposal,"" Vulcan CEO Bill Hilf said in a statement. He is estimated to have donated more than $2bn to philanthropy throughout his life,externalincluding science, education and wildlife conservation causes, the Associated Press report. He was also an avid sports fan, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the US Superbowl in 2013. In 2010 he pledged to give the majority of his fortune to charitable causes after his death.

"Craig Savage had bombarded his estranged wife with text messages and threatened her with revenge porn, the court heard A man shot his estranged wife, mother-in-law and pet dog with a stolen semi-automatic rifle in an execution-style killing, a court has heard. Craig Savage, 35, is accused of killing Michelle Savage, 32, and Heather Whitbread, 53, in Bexhill Road, St Leonards, East Sussex, on 16 March. Mrs Savage had been shot six times and her mother around seven times in a ""planned execution"", Lewes Crown Court was told. Mr Savage denies two counts of murder. He also denies possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. Benjamin Aina, prosecuting, said: ""He carried out the shooting because he had been rejected by his wife. They had separated about a month before the shooting and he was desperate for a reconciliation. ""One of the entry wounds on each woman was accompanied by a muzzle mark. This indicates that the firearm was pressed fairly close to each woman and discharged in an execution-type manner."" The two women were shot dead at the house in St Leonards in March The court heard Mr Savage, of no fixed address, had bombarded his estranged wife with text messages, threatened her with revenge porn, and had poured paint on family cars. About a week before the killings, on Mrs Savage's birthday, he slashed the tyres on her car, the jury was told. Mr Savage was described as a ""very controlling person"" with the ""attitude of a teenager"" during their nine-year relationship. He would bombard his wife with phone calls and texts, wanting to know where she was and who she was with, Mr Aina said. He was also ""horrible"" to her dog and the ""last straw in the relationship"" was when he was found ""pinning"" it to the ground, jurors were told. Following the break-up, Mr Savage was accused by his wife of trying to ""control every last interaction"", and she repeatedly said she did not want to see him anymore. The court heard he threatened to kill himself, wrongly accused her of giving him a sexually transmitted disease and demanded she hand over lingerie and sex toys so that he could burn them. Mr Aina said Mr Savage's defence was likely to be that the shooting was a ""complete accident"" and the gun went off accidentally after he tripped during a struggle with Mrs Savage. Mr Savage claimed he had planned to kidnap her and have police shoot him in front of her in a ""cop-assisted suicide"", Mr Aina told the court. The jury was told Mrs Savage's grandmother and her younger, pregnant sister were hiding in the house to escape the shooting and were not hurt. The court was told after the shooting, Mr Savage pointed the rifle at a police officer, but the mechanism had become jammed and the gun did not fire. Mr Savage has pleaded guilty to a charge of stealing a firearm. The jury was shown the M4 semi-automatic .22 calibre rifle and told that Savage admitted robbery after stealing it ""by force"" with ammunition from a firing range. The case continues.

"Claire Busby said her super king-size double divan was in a ""defective state"" A woman left paralysed after being ""catapulted"" from her new bed during sex is suing a bed firm for damages. Claire Busby, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, suffered spinal injuries when she fell from the super king-size double divan as she shifted her position. The 46-year-old is taking legal action against Berkshire Bed Company, trading as Beds Are Uzzz, saying the bed was in a ""defective state"". The firm denies liability for her injuries and is contesting the case, Judge Barry Cotter, sitting at the High Court, was told the ""central issue"" in the case is whether there were defects with the bed and whether Ms Busby's ""tragic injuries"" were caused or contributed to by them. The court heard Ms Busby was injured a week after the bed's delivery while with her partner John Marshall. She told the court she ""swung her legs"" from underneath her, before lying back on the bed. At that point, she claims, the bed gave way and she toppled off the end, landing on her head. She said: ""I spun around, I put my hand down and then I felt like I was catapulted off the back of the bed. ""I fell to the side and heard what felt like a spring in my body snap"". Ms Busby has taken her case to the High Court Ms Busby alleges the two divans which made up the base of the bed were not properly fastened together and two ""gliders"" - or feet - were missing from the end of the bed. Winston Hunter, for Ms Busby, said it was ""accepted that the particular circumstances of the accident are unusual"", but claimed the firm was still liable. Lawyers for the bed company argue it was properly assembled at the time of delivery, and even if the two gliders were missing it would not have caused the bed to collapse.

"Craig Williams denies manslaughter and fraud in relation to Oscar Abbey's death A baby choked to death in his cot because of the gross negligence of the bed designer, a jury has been told. Leeds Crown Court heard seven-month-old Oscar Abbey was found by his parents, caught in the side of his bed at their York home on 3 November 2016. The bed was sold to Charlie and Shannon Abbey by Playtime Beds and the firm's owner Craig Williams is accused of gross negligence manslaughter. Mr Williams denies manslaughter and fraud. John Elvidge QC, prosecuting, said Oscar died of ""positional asphyxia"". Mr Elvidge said: ""During the course of the night, [Oscar] wriggled his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed. His head was too big to fit through. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire ""In effect, he choked to death. He was starved of oxygen."" He told the jury the baby died ""because of the defendant's gross negligence"". ""He died because the cot bed bought by his parents from the defendant's company was designed and constructed without any care or thought for the safety of the child who was sleeping in it."" Mr and Mrs Abbey bought the bed from Mr Williams' Sheffield-based company, Playtime Beds Ltd, for Â£655 including delivery. The company made bespoke MDF beds in various shapes. Mr Williams, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was the bed designer and ""controlling mind"" of the company, which had two other employees, the court heard. The prosecutor said the unit sold to the Abbey family included the cot and a bed for Oscar's two-and-a-half-year-old brother, Maxwell. Jurors were told Mrs Abbey specifically asked what age the cot was suitable for before she bought the bed, and Mr Williams told her ""any age"". Mr Elvidge said Oscar had only started using the cot less than a week before he died, the jury heard. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist US President Donald Trump has suggested ""rogue killers"" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking to reporters after a phone call with King Salman, he said the Saudi leader had firmly denied knowing what had happened to Mr Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is flying to Saudi Arabia immediately. Turkish police have, for the first time, been inside the Saudi consulate where Mr Khashoggi was last seen. They entered the building around an hour after a group of Saudi officials. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents nearly two weeks ago but Riyadh has always strongly denied this. However,unconfirmed reports in the US media,externalsuggest Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong and that the original intention had been to abduct him. Meanwhile, Arabic channel Al-Jazeera quotes Turkey's attorney-general's office as saying it has found evidence to back claims that Mr Khashoggi was killed inside the mission. The issue has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with its closest Western allies. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Donald Trump and a world of disorder Mr Trump addressed snatched questions from reporters over helicopter engine noise at the White House, describing King Salman's denial as ""very, very strong"". ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" he added. ""Who knows?"" The president provided no evidence to back his comment. A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials have audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi was murdered inside the building. On Saturday, Mr Trump threatened Saudi Arabia with ""severe punishment""if it emerged that Mr Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate but ruled out halting big military contracts with Riyadh. Secretary of State Pompeo's visit to Saudi Arabia will be followed by a stop in Turkey. Diplomatic pressure is growing on the Saudis to give a fuller explanation. On Monday, King Salman ordered an investigation into the case. ""The king has ordered the public prosecutor to open an internal investigation into the Khashoggi matter based on the information from the joint team in Istanbul,"" an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Saudi officials arrived before the Turkish investigators The official said the prosecutor had been instructed to work quickly. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Last week, Turkey accepted a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. On Sunday,Riyadh angrily rejected political and economic ""threats""over the case of the missing journalist and said it would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"". Investigators entered the building in Istanbul on Monday afternoon - first a Saudi team followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. Turkish diplomatic sources had said the consulate would be searched by a joint Turkish-Saudi team. A group of cleaners was seen entering earlier. Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia agreed last week to allow Turkish officials to conduct a search but insisted it would only be a superficial ""visual"" inspection. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi Turkey rejected that offer. The Sabah daily newspaper said investigators had wanted to search the building with luminol, a chemical which shows up any traces of blood. It is not clear whether that happened. King Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone on Sunday evening, officials said, and stressed the importance of the two countries working together on the case. By Frank Gardner, BBC News Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have been rallying round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar. He has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who has written for the Washington Post, was last seen walking into the consulate on 2 October. Reports suggest an assault and struggle took place in the consulate after Mr Khashoggi went to get paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Turkish sources allege he was killed by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents but Riyadh insists that he left the consulate unharmed. Mr Khashoggi was once an adviser to the Saudi royal family but fell out of favour with the Saudi government and went into self-imposed exile. He is a US resident. The European Union has joined calls for a transparent investigation. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini briefed reporters after a meeting of the 28 foreign ministers. ""There was full consensus around the table on the fact that we expect transparency, we expect full clarity from investigations to be done by the Saudi authorities together and in full co-operation with the Turkish authorities,"" she said. Meanwhile, moreleading business figures say they will not attend a major investment conference in Riyadhlater this month. What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? The international conference, starting on 23 October, has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", though the World Economic Forum says it has nothing to do with its annual event in the Swiss Alps. Officially entitled the Future Finance Initiative, the Saudi conference describes itself as an ""international platform for expert-led debate between investors, innovators and governments as well as economic leaders"". Significantly, it was expected to showcase the reform agenda of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, is one of the latest high-profile executives to pull out. Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi are also among those who will not be attending the conference. A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the event's website. It is still unclear whether US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will attend the conference.

"This video can not be played John Bercow was asked earlier this year about bullying allegations against him Senior House of Commons staff need to make radical changes, a report into bullying and sexual harassment in Parliament has said. Dame Laura Cox's report details alleged sexual harassment by MPs by women who say they were ""inappropriately touched"" and ""repeatedly propositioned"". ""Disturbing"" cases have ""long been tolerated and concealed"", it says. Speaker John Bercow's office said the claims were ""serious"" and should be considered ""as a matter of urgency"". The House of Commons executive board apologised for ""past failings"" and said it was ""committed to changing our culture"". Dame Laura, a former high court judge, was appointed in March aftera Newsnight investigationuncovered complaints about a number of MPs, including Mr Bercow - allegations which he denies. BBC Newsnight policy editor Chris Cook called Dame Laura's report ""uncompromising"" and a ""thunderbolt"". Dame Laura described the House of Commons as a ""stark reminder of how bad things used to be"" and said there was a culture of ""deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence"". In her report, she detailed alleged sexual harassment by MPs, saying women reported being abused in ""vulgar, gender-related terms"". There were reports of ""inappropriate touching"", including men ""trying to kiss them, grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". There were ""frequent comments"" about women's appearance and suggestions that they should wear ""sexier clothing or more make-up"". ""Derogatory or lewd comments about women's anatomies"" were made, the report said. Staff reported being told off for using the ""wrong"" toilet or being being told to ""get out of the lift now"" because MPs wanted to use it. The effect of the alleged behaviour on some staff had been ""acutely distressing, long-lasting and, in some cases, devastating"". One staff member told the review: ""I felt physically sickâ¦.I would find myself crying in the toilets, I wasn't able to eat or sleep properly."" According to the report, other allegations of behaviour reported by members of staff included: being shouted at or belittled people swearing at them face to face or over the phone others being ""routinely unpleasant, overbearing or confrontational"" to them being constantly criticised or having derogatory remarks made about their work being told they are useless and humiliating them in front of others taunting, mocking or mimicking them While some managers had dealt effectively with complaints from women, Dame Laura said the majority received ""evasive responses, in which either their reports were questioned... or belittled"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Dame Laura said Mr Bercow and other people in positions of leadership, such as the clerk of the House of Commons and the director general of the House of Commons, should read the report ""very carefully"". 'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack Is Westminster culture really changing? MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans Senior figures, she said, needed to ask themselves ""do I understand that radical change is needed, can I deliver that and will the staff have confidence that I can deliver that change? ""If they can't answer yes honestly to those questions they should each of them be considering their position."" In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, Dame Laura said it was ""not a problem of the past, it's continuing"", adding that she was hearing a lot of information about ""things that are still going on"". A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said it was ""a serious report into a serious subject which deserves a serious response"". She added: ""The House of Commons Commission will meet as a matter of urgency in the coming days to consider the report and our response to it."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC News that the report's findings were ""not a surprise"" to her. ""I have seen sexism and sexist attitudes,"" she said. ""But people aren't going to pick on me because I'm not powerless. ""What we are talking about is a power imbalance."" By Chris Cook, BBC Newsnight policy editor Dame Laura was commissioned to conduct an independent investigation. She delivered a thunderbolt. This report, a response to the reports that Lucinda Day and I published in March, is uncompromising. If the House management commissioned it thinking that she would find that Newsnight had over-egged the problem, they will be sorely disappointed. She looked, as we did, at the treatment of the clerks - the apolitical staff who run the Commons and its committees. And she found, as we did, remarkable consistency in the accounts given by staff members about the problems in the House with bullying and harassment. There are some major conclusions she draws from her analysis of this dysfunctional workplace. She calls for a huge amount of change - after all, her analysis is that this is ""a culture that has actively sought to cover up such abusive conduct"". Read more from Chris Cook A separate ""review of of historical allegations"" is also under way, and in July MPs backed a new grievance procedure and behaviour code. But Dame Laura said it was ""difficult to envisage"" how solutions could be delivered under the current senior House administration. The House of Commons executive board said the report made ""difficult reading"" and added that there was no place for bullying and harassment. It said it was ""determined to learn lessons"" from the report, adding that it will meet on 22 October to consider the findings.

"This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist US President Donald Trump has suggested ""rogue killers"" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking to reporters after a phone call with King Salman, he said the Saudi leader had firmly denied knowing what had happened to Mr Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is flying to Saudi Arabia immediately. Turkish police have, for the first time, been inside the Saudi consulate where Mr Khashoggi was last seen. They entered the building around an hour after a group of Saudi officials. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents nearly two weeks ago but Riyadh has always strongly denied this. However,unconfirmed reports in the US media,externalsuggest Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong and that the original intention had been to abduct him. Meanwhile, Arabic channel Al-Jazeera quotes Turkey's attorney-general's office as saying it has found evidence to back claims that Mr Khashoggi was killed inside the mission. The issue has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with its closest Western allies. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Donald Trump and a world of disorder Mr Trump addressed snatched questions from reporters over helicopter engine noise at the White House, describing King Salman's denial as ""very, very strong"". ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" he added. ""Who knows?"" The president provided no evidence to back his comment. A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials have audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi was murdered inside the building. On Saturday, Mr Trump threatened Saudi Arabia with ""severe punishment""if it emerged that Mr Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate but ruled out halting big military contracts with Riyadh. Secretary of State Pompeo's visit to Saudi Arabia will be followed by a stop in Turkey. Diplomatic pressure is growing on the Saudis to give a fuller explanation. On Monday, King Salman ordered an investigation into the case. ""The king has ordered the public prosecutor to open an internal investigation into the Khashoggi matter based on the information from the joint team in Istanbul,"" an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Saudi officials arrived before the Turkish investigators The official said the prosecutor had been instructed to work quickly. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Last week, Turkey accepted a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. On Sunday,Riyadh angrily rejected political and economic ""threats""over the case of the missing journalist and said it would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"". Investigators entered the building in Istanbul on Monday afternoon - first a Saudi team followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. Turkish diplomatic sources had said the consulate would be searched by a joint Turkish-Saudi team. A group of cleaners was seen entering earlier. Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia agreed last week to allow Turkish officials to conduct a search but insisted it would only be a superficial ""visual"" inspection. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi Turkey rejected that offer. The Sabah daily newspaper said investigators had wanted to search the building with luminol, a chemical which shows up any traces of blood. It is not clear whether that happened. King Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone on Sunday evening, officials said, and stressed the importance of the two countries working together on the case. By Frank Gardner, BBC News Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have been rallying round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar. He has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who has written for the Washington Post, was last seen walking into the consulate on 2 October. Reports suggest an assault and struggle took place in the consulate after Mr Khashoggi went to get paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Turkish sources allege he was killed by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents but Riyadh insists that he left the consulate unharmed. Mr Khashoggi was once an adviser to the Saudi royal family but fell out of favour with the Saudi government and went into self-imposed exile. He is a US resident. The European Union has joined calls for a transparent investigation. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini briefed reporters after a meeting of the 28 foreign ministers. ""There was full consensus around the table on the fact that we expect transparency, we expect full clarity from investigations to be done by the Saudi authorities together and in full co-operation with the Turkish authorities,"" she said. Meanwhile, moreleading business figures say they will not attend a major investment conference in Riyadhlater this month. What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? The international conference, starting on 23 October, has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", though the World Economic Forum says it has nothing to do with its annual event in the Swiss Alps. Officially entitled the Future Finance Initiative, the Saudi conference describes itself as an ""international platform for expert-led debate between investors, innovators and governments as well as economic leaders"". Significantly, it was expected to showcase the reform agenda of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, is one of the latest high-profile executives to pull out. Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi are also among those who will not be attending the conference. A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the event's website. It is still unclear whether US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will attend the conference.

"The ""talking tables"" are being launched as the government puts forward its ""loneliness strategy"" If you were lonely, would you go into a cafe and sit down for a chat with a complete stranger? That's the idea behind the ""talking tables"" initiative. Sainsburys supermarket has designated some tables in its cafes as places where you can have a conversation with a stranger instead of sitting alone and feeling isolated. It comes as the government launches its ""loneliness strategy"". But what's really revealing is to hear what shopworkers see of the loneliness of their customers. Edward has become friends with customers and attended their funerals There are about 20 Sainsbury's cafes piloting the ""talking tables"" idea, including the branch in Fulham, west London. Edward Collet, who works on the welcome desk, sees people every day who come to the supermarket for company as much as for shopping. He says some are bereaved husbands who relied on the social networking skills of their wives and are now trapped in ""solitary lives"". They don't want to be ""stigmatised"" as lonely, he says, and might crave company, but don't feel able to ask for it. Edward says they come up to the information desk for a chat about shopping - or even call up the helpline. The tables for chatting are being introduced in 20 shops this autumn He sees shoppers who will wait until they can be served by a particular check-out assistant, because they see them as friends and this is a moment when they can swap a few words. It's their chance for some human interaction. There are also young mothers, cut off from the adult company of work, who, Edward says, can seem quite angry, which he puts down to their feelings of isolation. 'People fade away without human company' With so many public places closing, whether it's post offices, libraries, churches or pubs, he says, the supermarket has become one of the last places people can still meet and feel safe. He sees those at risk of chronic isolation - where people lose contact with the outside world and ""basically die inside their houses"". And there are others who have begun to show signs of dementia. Edward has become so much a part of the life of the people using the shop that, he says, he has been to some of his customers' funerals. And, he says, staff in the shop often work alongside local charities, churches and food banks, in a kind of informal support network. Rupa Graham says young people and old people should spend more time together Leigh Brown, the store manager, says much of what really happens in a shop goes unrecognised by the customers who dive in and out. He says last week an elderly man was noticed spending the entire day in the shop - and as it was eventually closing, Leigh gave him a lift home. The manager is confident the talking tables will catch on with customers, because, he says, he's seen how in other places they attract their own ""cult following"", with people making it part of their social lives. The cafes also have their own secret tactic against being taken over by laptop users - none of them have power sockets. So if these people working for a supermarket were asked for their own first-hand answers for tackling loneliness, what would they suggest? The supermarket has become the modern equivalent of the village green Rupa Graham says the challenge is to ""bridge the gap"" between generations in families - so that young people could spend more time with old people. She also would like to have less negative news, because it creates a ""perceived fear of talking to strangers"" so that people are afraid to make friends. Leigh says the most pressing problem is that ""town centres are dying"" - and the places where people might socialise are disappearing. ""What are we going to do with them? We need to re-invent town centres. We're going to end up with ghost towns,"" he says. Edward says that loneliness needs to be understood from the perspective of those most vulnerable. Protecting public transport, particularly bus routes, is essential, he says. Leigh Brown says that people don't realise how much people rely on shops for company ""They might want to close a bus stop and say it's only five minutes walk - but it's not five minutes if you've got arthritis,"" he says. The other big question, linked to good transport, is a sense of safety. He says many elderly customers are worried about going out and they need to be able to travel safely and feel they are in a secure environment. But, he says, all of this depends on a sense of community surviving - which itself can be a fragile thing. In this part of London, he says, there has been rapid gentrification but there are still the links of older communities. ""There are people who bought a house for five bob in 1945 and their families are still here,"" he says. But will the tables get people talking? On a rainy Monday morning, with the new signs in place, there were no takers. The conversation about loneliness is still waiting to begin.

"Brexit negotiations have hit a ""real problem"" over the issue of the Irish border, government sources have warned. Hopes of a breakthrough were raised when the Brexit secretary made an unscheduled trip to Brussels on Sunday. But talks faltered over the need for a back-up plan - known as the backstop - to avoid a hard border. Theresa May, who is briefing MPs, has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea. Ahead of a key summit of European leaders on Wednesday, the EU is believed to be seeking further reassurances that its internal market will be protected and that additional customs and regulatory checks can be carried out without the return of physical infrastructure on the border. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit and the 'battle for the union' Sunday's talks had broken down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland - if the UK's version wasn't ready in time, Downing Street sources indicated.

The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And the party's Brexit spokesmanhas said,externalthe prospect of a no-deal Brexit is ""probably inevitable"". Ireland's Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, suggested a deal would not be done at this week's summit, which starts on Wednesday. Mr Coveney said he was  ""frustrated and disappointed"" that it was going to take ""more time than people had hoped"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, has set out her alternative Brexit plans, saying it is ""time to compromise"". The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, along with its single market and customs union, which allow for friction-free trade between members. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Monday's papers: 'Brexit impasse' and a 'tussle in Brussels' Sturgeon: 'Time to compromise' on Brexit After Brexit, it will have a land border with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland - but cannot agree how. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? So, the backstop is a position of last resort - to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations. The two sides do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Mrs May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border in the Irish Sea. She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This week's summit comes as domestic political pressure on Mrs May increasesamid threats of potential cabinet resignations. Some Brexiteers are unhappy at the idea of the UK staying aligned to EU rules without a time limit being specified. At the weekend, former Brexit Secretary David Davis urged ministers to ""exert their collective authority"" and rebel against the plans. Allow Twitter content?

Labour, meanwhile, has called on the government to publish its plan for the backstop.

"More than three quarters of people questioned said improving public services was a post-Brexit priority Voters are split over whether the UK leaving the EU will improve the economy, new research has suggested. The study of 2,975 UK adults,,externalconducted in 2017 by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found about a third think it will be better in 10 years. The same proportion think the economy will be worse. Lead researcher Sir John Curtice said people expected the UK to take a short term ""hit"" from Brexit. The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019. Talks on the terms of the UK's exit are nearing a crunch point, with both sides pushing for an agreement by the middle of November at the latest. But on Monday, government sources warned that Brexit negotiations have hit a ""real problem""over the issue of the Irish border. Brexit: All you need to know Theresa May says Brexit deal still 'achievable' The survey also found a split on the future of the NHS and immigration. It said 29% of the people surveyed think the health service will improve in 10 years, while 29% think it will be worse. And 46% expect immigration to fall, while 45% think it will be unchanged or rise. Asked to name three priorities for a post-Brexit UK, more than three-quarters of people called for improved public services. The next two priorities on the list were creating jobs and reducing low pay, with reducing immigration in fourth place. Sir John said a minority of people expected Brexit to allow the UK more control over the NHS. But he said there was not a strong correlation between people's expectations and the Leave campaign's promise - printed on its bus - that the NHS would get an extra Â£350m. Sir John said said: ""People want better public services. We have found that a minority, but only a minority, think we will get more control over the health service as a result of Brexit. ""I'm not really clear that there's that much of a connection in what we have found, at least, between that promise on the battle bus and people's priorities for post-Brexit Britain."" Sir John said there was no strong correlation between expectations and the Leave campaign's promise, printed on its battle bus Sir John said lower immigration was more of a priority for Leave voters than for Remain voters. ""They'd like to see it fall,"" he said. ""But not necessarily at the expense of what was most obviously the principal priority that people had, which was improving the state of our public services."" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns on poverty in Britain, said the results challenged politicians to address voters' everyday concerns. Chief executive Campbell Robb said: ""Brexit is overwhelming British politics and while we wait for negotiations to conclude, more children, workers, families and disabled people are being swept into a rising tide of poverty. ""The public expect improvements in public services, more jobs and fewer people struggling on low incomes after Brexit. ""We know leaving the EU alone will not deliver this, so we need a bold package of domestic reforms.""

"This video can not be played Several months' of rain hit France's southern Aude region, causing multiple fatalities At least 10 people have been killed by flash floods in the Aude region of southern France. Local authorities say several months' worth of rain fell in just a few hours overnight, leaving roads blocked in some areas. A nun was swept away by the River Aude, local broadcaster BFMTV reports.

"David Carroll was handed a 26-week suspended prison sentence for fraud by false representation A woman whose husband pretended to have cancer has said his years of lying ""stole so much of my life"". Lucy Witchard, of Leicester, said David Carroll, 35, told her he had leukaemia when they met in 2006 - they married in 2011 and have since divorced. She said in 2015 her mother gave him Â£2,000 for treatment in the US after he said the cancer was terminal. Carroll was given a suspended prison sentence for fraud at Leicester Magistrates' Court last week. During their four years of marriage, Carroll had also lied about having prostate and stomach cancer, but later admitted this, Ms Witchard said. She told the BBC Carroll would not allow her to attend chemotherapy sessions in hospital and frequently said the leukaemia got better and worse. ""He would say, 'I'm protecting you from this' and I'd get too emotional being there,"" she said. ""When I questioned his treatment he threatened to leave me saying our relationship could not work if I didn't trust him."" Latest news from the East Midlands The family became suspicious while Carroll was in the US - enjoying a holiday rather than receiving cancer treatment. The 31-year-old said she confronted him on his return but he went ""ballistic"" and tried to keep up the pretence. ""He even got a work friend to call me pretending to be his doctor,"" she said. ""I knew after that phone call that our marriage was over."" Ms Witchard said she still felt ""incredibly hurt and angry"", as he ""stole so much of my life"". 'The water washes the anxiety away' Video shows Jet2 plane aborting landing due to wind 'Headphones don't rape women' Linda Eccles, Ms Witchard's mother, said she was ""heartbroken and devastated"" by his ""lies, deceit and selfishness"". ""I gave Dave Â£2,000 to travel to America to save his life,"" she said. ""I had the money to help my daughter's dying husband, prevent my daughter from becoming a widow."" Aylestone Athletic RFC organised a charity fun run in honour of team-mate Carroll in 2016 After Carroll's marriage ended, he joined Leicester rugby club, Aylestone Athletic RFC in 2015. During a game, he suffered an injury and was treated in hospital. Former team-mate Jonathan Hunt told the BBC: ""David told us later doctors discovered he had leukaemia from a blood test. ""We thought 'poor guy'. It was unfortunate. ""We felt sorry for him and people regularly gave him free handouts of food and drink."" Mr Hunt said Carroll, who had planned to run seven marathons in seven days, later told them he was also diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to have surgery. ""The club had organised two charity fundraising events to support David's efforts as he was unable to complete the challenge himself,"" Mr Hunt said. ""Before the fun run, he told members his condition was terminal and could get treatment in America."" The 29-year-old said the club raised more than Â£2,000 for Barnardo's - Carroll's chosen charity for the 2016 London Marathon -""in his honour"". Carroll, now living in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Wales, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, after being found guilty of fraud by false representation. He was also told to complete 180 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Â£2,000 compensation. A 12-month restraining order means he is not allowed to contact Ms Witchard or his mother-in-law Ms Eccles. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played John Bercow was asked earlier this year about bullying allegations against him Senior House of Commons staff need to make radical changes, a report into bullying and sexual harassment in Parliament has said. Dame Laura Cox's report details alleged sexual harassment by MPs by women who say they were ""inappropriately touched"" and ""repeatedly propositioned"". ""Disturbing"" cases have ""long been tolerated and concealed"", it says. Speaker John Bercow's office said the claims were ""serious"" and should be considered ""as a matter of urgency"". The House of Commons executive board apologised for ""past failings"" and said it was ""committed to changing our culture"". Dame Laura, a former high court judge, was appointed in March aftera Newsnight investigationuncovered complaints about a number of MPs, including Mr Bercow - allegations which he denies. BBC Newsnight policy editor Chris Cook called Dame Laura's report ""uncompromising"" and a ""thunderbolt"". Dame Laura described the House of Commons as a ""stark reminder of how bad things used to be"" and said there was a culture of ""deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence"". In her report, she detailed alleged sexual harassment by MPs, saying women reported being abused in ""vulgar, gender-related terms"". There were reports of ""inappropriate touching"", including men ""trying to kiss them, grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". There were ""frequent comments"" about women's appearance and suggestions that they should wear ""sexier clothing or more make-up"". ""Derogatory or lewd comments about women's anatomies"" were made, the report said. Staff reported being told off for using the ""wrong"" toilet or being being told to ""get out of the lift now"" because MPs wanted to use it. The effect of the alleged behaviour on some staff had been ""acutely distressing, long-lasting and, in some cases, devastating"". One staff member told the review: ""I felt physically sickâ¦.I would find myself crying in the toilets, I wasn't able to eat or sleep properly."" According to the report, other allegations of behaviour reported by members of staff included: being shouted at or belittled people swearing at them face to face or over the phone others being ""routinely unpleasant, overbearing or confrontational"" to them being constantly criticised or having derogatory remarks made about their work being told they are useless and humiliating them in front of others taunting, mocking or mimicking them While some managers had dealt effectively with complaints from women, Dame Laura said the majority received ""evasive responses, in which either their reports were questioned... or belittled"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Dame Laura said Mr Bercow and other people in positions of leadership, such as the clerk of the House of Commons and the director general of the House of Commons, should read the report ""very carefully"". 'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack Is Westminster culture really changing? MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans Senior figures, she said, needed to ask themselves ""do I understand that radical change is needed, can I deliver that and will the staff have confidence that I can deliver that change? ""If they can't answer yes honestly to those questions they should each of them be considering their position."" In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, Dame Laura said it was ""not a problem of the past, it's continuing"", adding that she was hearing a lot of information about ""things that are still going on"". A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said it was ""a serious report into a serious subject which deserves a serious response"". She added: ""The House of Commons Commission will meet as a matter of urgency in the coming days to consider the report and our response to it."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC News that the report's findings were ""not a surprise"" to her. ""I have seen sexism and sexist attitudes,"" she said. ""But people aren't going to pick on me because I'm not powerless. ""What we are talking about is a power imbalance."" By Chris Cook, BBC Newsnight policy editor Dame Laura was commissioned to conduct an independent investigation. She delivered a thunderbolt. This report, a response to the reports that Lucinda Day and I published in March, is uncompromising. If the House management commissioned it thinking that she would find that Newsnight had over-egged the problem, they will be sorely disappointed. She looked, as we did, at the treatment of the clerks - the apolitical staff who run the Commons and its committees. And she found, as we did, remarkable consistency in the accounts given by staff members about the problems in the House with bullying and harassment. There are some major conclusions she draws from her analysis of this dysfunctional workplace. She calls for a huge amount of change - after all, her analysis is that this is ""a culture that has actively sought to cover up such abusive conduct"". Read more from Chris Cook A separate ""review of of historical allegations"" is also under way, and in July MPs backed a new grievance procedure and behaviour code. But Dame Laura said it was ""difficult to envisage"" how solutions could be delivered under the current senior House administration. The House of Commons executive board said the report made ""difficult reading"" and added that there was no place for bullying and harassment. It said it was ""determined to learn lessons"" from the report, adding that it will meet on 22 October to consider the findings.

"Armed anti-terror police are at the scene German police say they now have an armed assailant at Cologne's main railway station ""under control"" and the woman he took hostage is receiving medical treatment. She had minor injuries from the incident but he is reported to have serious injuries. There was a full evacuation of the station, one of Germany's biggest transport hubs. Local media say the incident does not appear to have been terror-related. Earlier there were unconfirmed reports of shots being fired. Police quoted by the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger daily said a couple were involved, and the man had argued with the woman in a McDonald's restaurant, before holding her in a pharmacy at the station. Reports speak of at least one explosion during the incident. Deutsche Bahn cancelled or delayed train services in Cologne during the stand-off.

"Accessories chain Claire's is reported to be considering closing some of its UK stores. The Press Association said the High Street chain was talking to restructuring firms about ""a number of options"". The chain has more than 370 stores in the UK, according to its most recent accounts. A spokeswoman for Claire's said closing underperforming stores was ""part of normal business practice"". According to PA, one rescue plan being considered is a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) where some stores are closed and rents are reduced on remaining stores. Claire's chief executive Ron Marshall said it had no plans for either a CVA or major store closures in the UK ""in the foreseeable future"". ""Any stores we do close or open in the UK would be as part of our normal course of business,"" he added. Was Claire's the ultimate tween accessory? Kate Ormrod, an analyst at research firm GlobalData, said it would not be surprising if Claire's did close stores, saying the move was ""long overdue"". ''Claire's struggles to compete on fashion appeal and product newness when compared to clothing specialists such as Primark and New Look, while its niche shopper base of tweens [8 to 12-year-olds] and young teens also makes it hard to drive footfall and sales given their limited funds,"" she added. Claire's targets teenagers and tweens The chain, which offers ear piercing as well as affordable jewellery, is the latest retailer to be hit by the tough High Street conditions that have also sparked the collapse of Maplin and Toys R Us. House of Fraser fell into administration before being bought by Sports Direct, while stores such as Debenhams, New Look and Homebase have had to close dozens of outlets in an attempt to remain profitable. The news comes days after Claire's US parent company emerged from bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 protection is aimed at giving firms time to restructure their finances. Mr Marshall said the firm was now ""a healthier, more profitable company"". Was Claire's the ultimate tween accessory?

"Each month, thousands of new parents buy stair gates, such as the version seen here - which was not one of the products named by Which? Parents should immediately stop using three market-leading child stair gates, a consumer group has said after carrying out its own safety tests. Which? tested the durability of 10 gates and their tests found that three failed to meet EU safety standards. The group believes there should be an immediate recall of the Dreambaby Retractable Gate, which it says failed after just 10 applications of force. The manufacturer said it investigated all complaints about its products. The other gates which failed Which?'s testing were the Lindam Easy Fit Plus Deluxe Safety Gate and the Safetots Self-closing Gate. Which? said all three were currently available in major high street shops and online. The products were attached with adhesive pads and tested by applying the ""fatigue test"" 10,000 times. The test forms part of the EU safety standard for stair gates and is designed to simulate the gate being pulled back and forth by a child over time. For the Dreambaby Retractable Gate, Which? said the metal tube attached to the gate became bent and detached from the casing that holds it in place, leading to the gate sagging in the middle. The Dreambaby Retractable Gate failed after just 10 applications of force The Safetots gate failed after 3,700 applications of force, with the adhesive pads that secure the gate to a door frame becoming detatched. The gate can also be fitted using screws and in this case passed the testing. In the Which? tests, the adhesive pads also became detached from the Lindam gate after 2,570 applications of force. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the findings were ""shocking"". He said: ""The manufacturers need to act urgently to prevent any more children from being put at risk by products which may be unsafe."" The Lindam Easy Fit Plus Deluxe Safety Gate failed after 2,570 applications of force Dreambaby said complaints about its products were ""rare"" but were investigated immediately. In a statement, the company said: ""Our ability to undertake a thorough investigation of the matters raised have been significantly frustrated by the failure of Which? to provide sufficient background detail despite our repeated requests for this information. ""We are therefore unable to provide a considered response at this time.' Munchkin, the company that owns Lindam, said it was not aware of any evidence supporting the allegations and its gates met European safety standards. Safetots also disputed the findings and said its gate met the standards that Which? had tested. Which? said it had reported its findings to Trading Standards and the Office for Product Safety and Standards.

"This video can not be played John Bercow was asked earlier this year about bullying allegations against him Senior House of Commons staff need to make radical changes, a report into bullying and sexual harassment in Parliament has said. Dame Laura Cox's report details alleged sexual harassment by MPs by women who say they were ""inappropriately touched"" and ""repeatedly propositioned"". ""Disturbing"" cases have ""long been tolerated and concealed"", it says. Speaker John Bercow's office said the claims were ""serious"" and should be considered ""as a matter of urgency"". The House of Commons executive board apologised for ""past failings"" and said it was ""committed to changing our culture"". Dame Laura, a former high court judge, was appointed in March aftera Newsnight investigationuncovered complaints about a number of MPs, including Mr Bercow - allegations which he denies. BBC Newsnight policy editor Chris Cook called Dame Laura's report ""uncompromising"" and a ""thunderbolt"". Dame Laura described the House of Commons as a ""stark reminder of how bad things used to be"" and said there was a culture of ""deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence"". In her report, she detailed alleged sexual harassment by MPs, saying women reported being abused in ""vulgar, gender-related terms"". There were reports of ""inappropriate touching"", including men ""trying to kiss them, grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". There were ""frequent comments"" about women's appearance and suggestions that they should wear ""sexier clothing or more make-up"". ""Derogatory or lewd comments about women's anatomies"" were made, the report said. Staff reported being told off for using the ""wrong"" toilet or being being told to ""get out of the lift now"" because MPs wanted to use it. The effect of the alleged behaviour on some staff had been ""acutely distressing, long-lasting and, in some cases, devastating"". One staff member told the review: ""I felt physically sickâ¦.I would find myself crying in the toilets, I wasn't able to eat or sleep properly."" According to the report, other allegations of behaviour reported by members of staff included: being shouted at or belittled people swearing at them face to face or over the phone others being ""routinely unpleasant, overbearing or confrontational"" to them being constantly criticised or having derogatory remarks made about their work being told they are useless and humiliating them in front of others taunting, mocking or mimicking them While some managers had dealt effectively with complaints from women, Dame Laura said the majority received ""evasive responses, in which either their reports were questioned... or belittled"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Dame Laura said Mr Bercow and other people in positions of leadership, such as the clerk of the House of Commons and the director general of the House of Commons, should read the report ""very carefully"". 'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack Is Westminster culture really changing? MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans Senior figures, she said, needed to ask themselves ""do I understand that radical change is needed, can I deliver that and will the staff have confidence that I can deliver that change? ""If they can't answer yes honestly to those questions they should each of them be considering their position."" In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, Dame Laura said it was ""not a problem of the past, it's continuing"", adding that she was hearing a lot of information about ""things that are still going on"". A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said it was ""a serious report into a serious subject which deserves a serious response"". She added: ""The House of Commons Commission will meet as a matter of urgency in the coming days to consider the report and our response to it."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC News that the report's findings were ""not a surprise"" to her. ""I have seen sexism and sexist attitudes,"" she said. ""But people aren't going to pick on me because I'm not powerless. ""What we are talking about is a power imbalance."" By Chris Cook, BBC Newsnight policy editor Dame Laura was commissioned to conduct an independent investigation. She delivered a thunderbolt. This report, a response to the reports that Lucinda Day and I published in March, is uncompromising. If the House management commissioned it thinking that she would find that Newsnight had over-egged the problem, they will be sorely disappointed. She looked, as we did, at the treatment of the clerks - the apolitical staff who run the Commons and its committees. And she found, as we did, remarkable consistency in the accounts given by staff members about the problems in the House with bullying and harassment. There are some major conclusions she draws from her analysis of this dysfunctional workplace. She calls for a huge amount of change - after all, her analysis is that this is ""a culture that has actively sought to cover up such abusive conduct"". Read more from Chris Cook A separate ""review of of historical allegations"" is also under way, and in July MPs backed a new grievance procedure and behaviour code. But Dame Laura said it was ""difficult to envisage"" how solutions could be delivered under the current senior House administration. The House of Commons executive board said the report made ""difficult reading"" and added that there was no place for bullying and harassment. It said it was ""determined to learn lessons"" from the report, adding that it will meet on 22 October to consider the findings.

"Craig Williams denies manslaughter and fraud in relation to Oscar Abbey's death A baby choked to death in his cot because of the gross negligence of the bed designer, a jury has been told. Leeds Crown Court heard seven-month-old Oscar Abbey was found by his parents, caught in the side of his bed at their York home on 3 November 2016. The bed was sold to Charlie and Shannon Abbey by Playtime Beds and the firm's owner Craig Williams is accused of gross negligence manslaughter. Mr Williams denies manslaughter and fraud. John Elvidge QC, prosecuting, said Oscar died of ""positional asphyxia"". Mr Elvidge said: ""During the course of the night, [Oscar] wriggled his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed. His head was too big to fit through. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire ""In effect, he choked to death. He was starved of oxygen."" He told the jury the baby died ""because of the defendant's gross negligence"". ""He died because the cot bed bought by his parents from the defendant's company was designed and constructed without any care or thought for the safety of the child who was sleeping in it."" Mr and Mrs Abbey bought the bed from Mr Williams' Sheffield-based company, Playtime Beds Ltd, for Â£655 including delivery. The company made bespoke MDF beds in various shapes. Mr Williams, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was the bed designer and ""controlling mind"" of the company, which had two other employees, the court heard. The prosecutor said the unit sold to the Abbey family included the cot and a bed for Oscar's two-and-a-half-year-old brother, Maxwell. Jurors were told Mrs Abbey specifically asked what age the cot was suitable for before she bought the bed, and Mr Williams told her ""any age"". Mr Elvidge said Oscar had only started using the cot less than a week before he died, the jury heard. The trial continues.

"The car is essentially built; it just needs funding to go and set records The project to race a car at over 1,000mph has run into a financial roadblock with the company behind the venture going into administration. TheBloodhound supersonic vehicle,externalis all but built but needs a Â£25m investment if it is to break records on a dried-out lakebed in South Africa. The administrators,FRP Advisory LLP,external, have already begun to talk to potential suitors and want to hear from others. But without the funds the project faces being wound up in the coming weeks. Bloodhound is using the same jet technology as in the Eurofighter-Typhoon Bloodhound is, by any measure, the most sophisticated land speed record car ever conceived. To be powered by a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine bolted to a rocket, it should easily smash the existing world mark of 763mph (1,228km/h). And computer simulations indicate it ought to be capable of going much, much faster still. But although all the R&D is done, with the car even conducting some low-speed trials - the project simply cannot now move forward into its end phase unless the necessary funding is in place. ""This is the situation,"" explained Andrew Sheridan from FRP Advisory LLP's Bristol office. ""We have a legal entity that has gone into administration because it hasn't got any more cash. But there is a project there that is very much alive and on the cusp of delivering its goal, which is ground-breaking with leading technology. ""However, it does need circa Â£25m to get it over the line, and that now requires an investor, be that a wealthy individual or a corporate of some kind,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year Bloodhound is a private undertaking. It is funded through donation, sponsorship and partnership. Bloodhound has excelled at leveraging all three, but ultimately this funding model has not delivered sufficient cash to fully sustain such a complex venture. The last two-to-three years have been an especially tough environment in which to raise financial support. The investment landscape is difficult, in part because of Brexit uncertainty, but principally because many large brands that might once have put their name on the side of a car to build awareness are now using other marketing tools, such as social media. By going into administration, Bloodhound Programme Ltd, the company behind Project Bloodhound, gets some breathing space to allow it to find a solution. Supporters have paid to have their names printed on the tail fin The main structure of the vehicle is built, and last October Bloodhound conducted shakedown runs, topping 200mph (320km/h) on the runway at Newquay airport in Cornwall. The track on which it intends to break the land speed record is also ready to host the car. The Northern Cape Government in South Africa has had an 18km-long, 1,500m-wide section of Hakskeen Pan cleared of stones. And, significantly, the one major element in the technical package that was outstanding has just demonstrated its readiness. This is the rocket that would go in the back of Bloodhound to push it through the sound barrier. Developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo, it was launched to space for the first time at the end of September. The Nucleus rocket flew to an altitude of 107km from the AndÃ¸ya Space Center. Bloodhound would use a cluster of three Nucleus motors in addition to the Eurofighter EJ200 jet. ""Once we have the funding in place, or at least visibility of that funding, and the team is back in the building, then 10 months later we're out in South Africa,"" said Mark Chapman, Bloodhound's chief engineer. ""We're that close. This is a huge opportunity for global exposure. Nammo firing that motor was really important, really impressive."" Nammo's rocket had a flawless first outing last month If the Â£25m becomes available, Bloodhound could start running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the lakebed has evaporated the seasonal rains and the ground has become bone dry. The current plan is to run the car in the first instance in the region of 500-600mph (800-965km/h), using just the Eurofighter jet, to get a better sense of how the car behaves as it approaches the speed of sound. The team would then wait for another rain season to pass before returning to Hakskeen with the addition of a Nammo motor to raise the land speed record above 800mph, and then ultimately to over 1,000mph. So, that would probably mean running in 2020 and again in 2021. Having fun, learning Bloodhound was launched in 2008 as a ""vehicle"" to get children excited about science and engineering, and to persuade them of the benefits of entering technical careers. This STEM campaign was one of the reasons big engineering firms got involved because they saw the project as a means to promote their apprenticeship schemes. To date, this""education adventure"",externalhas reached over two million children, including 120,000 schoolchildren in the UK each year. The education side of things is unaffected by Monday's news because it is organised as a charity; it has separate sources of income. The current world land speed record was set in 1997 by the Thrust Super Sonic Car. The UK team behind it was led by Bloodhound's Project Director, Richard Noble. Thrust's driver, Andy Green, is also the pilot for Bloodhound.

"Ian and Stuart Paton's pumpkin weighs a whopping 2,433.9lb Twin brothers have squashed their own record for the UK's heaviest pumpkin grown indoors. Ian and Stuart Paton, 57, broke their existing record with a giant 174 stone (1,105kg) vegetable at the Jubilee Sailing Trust Pumpkin Festival in Netley, Southampton, on Saturday. Their previous record of 162 stone (1,028.7kg) was set last year. The pair, who have been growing pumpkins since they were 11, hope to smash the world record one day. The world record for the heaviest pumpkin currently stands at 187 stone (1,187.5kg) and was achieved in Germany in October 2016. ""We're certainly heading in the right direction,"" said Ian, who runs a flower nursery with his brother in Lymington. Describing pumpkins as ""awesome"", he added: ""The first pumpkin we grew was 54lb, now we watch them grow at 60lb a day."" The brothers had previously grown a 162 stone pumpkin The brothers' winning squash is a hybrid and was ""crossed with the very best [pumpkins] in the world"". Ian said the other secret to growing monster pumpkins was ""very light open soil"" and ""plenty of water in the summer"".

"This morning: MPs questioned environment ministers Followed by: Urgent question on sickness benefit underpayments Exchanges over 'meaningful' Brexit vote for MPs dominate business statement Later: Debates on supermarket supply chains and World Menopause Day House of Lords debated cyber security and music education Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins and Ryan Brown ESA Underpayments Statement Repeat House of LordsParliament Peers are now responding to the repeated statement on ESA underpayments, which is being read by Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscome. Itemerged yesterdaythat tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. In response to Labour spokesperson Baroness Sherlock's questions regarding compensation, Baroness Buscome says it is important to ""make clear"" that ""no one saw a cash reduction when they transferred to ESA, this is about extra money they may have been entitled to"". ""The key lesson we're learning is that it's a mistake to try to prepopulate information without being in touch with claimants,"" she adds. Following this, the Lords adjourn. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Black of Brentwood sums up the debate, telling peers he fears that ""the government is in denial, which is extremely sad"". Lord Black says the government ""must listen to the facts, and what is really going on the ground, and then act"". Peers are now hearing the repeat of an urgent question in the Commons earlier about sickness benefit underpayments. Debate on Music Education in Schools Education Minister Lord Agnew says music is a statutory part of the national curriculum, so all students in school aged 5 to 14 ""must study the subject"". He says between 2016 and 2020 the government is providing Â£300m for 120 music education hubs so all students can learn a musical instrument. He adds that a plan setting out the priorities for music education will be revealed by ministers ""in the coming months"". He denies that the English Baccalaureate is responsible for forcing music ""out of the curriculum"", and says the number of pupils taking music qualifications has been ""stable since 2010"". The debate on World Menopause Day comes to an end, and with it our coverage from the House of Commons for today. The day began with questions to environment ministers, followed by an urgent question on underpayments to tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits. It wasannounced yesterdaythat the government will now pay Â£1.5bn in back payments to correct errors made when people were moved onto Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Pensions Minister Sarah Newton prompted shouts from the opposition benches when she claimed ""good housekeeping"" at her department had led to the problem being spotted. Then Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom revealed the Offensive Weapons Bill will return to the Commons on Monday, during her business statement to MPs. She also responded to a series of concerns raised by MPs regarding a ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour education spokesman Lord Watson of Invergowrie says it is ""inevitable"" that schools will have to cut back on teaching music, as the money given to local authorities is ""continuously cut"". He says the government is ""in denial about the declining number of students taking Music GCSE year on year"". The English Baccalaureate is ""detrimental"" to arts subjects, he says, and the government's claim that there is no less emphasis on the arts ""does not stack up"". He says ""too many schools lack the time, resources and expertise"" to deliver sufficient music education, and the government ""must support these schools"". Lord Watson says Labour would introduce an arts pupil premium to ensure arts facilities in state schools match those in the private sector. He asks whether ministers ""are content to music to remain for the wealthy"", as he says this is ""what is currently happening"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Lord Storey says although music is part of the national curriculum, fewer schools follow it because they have turned into academies. This means there is ""no real pressure on schools to teach music"", he adds. He blames this on ""a combination of austerity, narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on exam results rather than the quality of education experience"". He says the school where he was a headteacher in a deprived part of Liverpool had a full-time music teacher, which was ""life changing for those pupils"". ""Every child must have a rich education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says says she agrees with all statements that have been raised in this debate. She says the government has been ""too restrictive"" in trying to implement a ""good standard of education"". She argues that the English Baccalaureate accountability measures ""are too narrow"". Universities in the Russell Group ""have given the impression to schools that arts subjects are not strong enough subjects for getting into university"", she says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Tory peer Lord Borwick says technology is expanding the possibilities of music teaching, pointing out that the quality of listening technology for iPhones and iPads is ""improving rapidly."" This will lead to mobile teaching and ""inevitably lead to the reduction in cost"", he says. ""What an inspiring future is coming our way. I'm much more optimistic"", he adds. New software needs to be developed for this, he says, suggesting it is important students are taught ""the skills for the future"", and this opens up music for those who lack ability or aptitude. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Responding to the debate, Communities Minister Nigel Adams says the ""inconsistent levels of awareness"" about the menopause reflects ""a history of stigma"". He says he agrees that it is important that education about the menopause is improved. With an ageing workforce, he adds that positive action by employers will benefit productivity and retention. ""One in four women in the workplace are going through or have gone through the menopause"", he adds. He concludes that it is essential that all employers and healthcare professionals are ""fully informed"" about providing treatment and support. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace of Saltaire says having fewer music teacher vacancies is not something to celebrate. ""That's because there are fewer posts to appoint teachers to"", he adds. ""To neglect this dimension of education in order to cut taxes and public spending, would be as irrational as cutting spending on the police whilst claiming to support the principles of private property."" Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Lexden, who is president of the Independent Schools Association, says music is ""one of the great strengths of the independent sector of education"". ""I draw attention to this state of affairs, not in any spirit of self congratulations,"" he says, but to point out that independent schools can assist state schools with resources. He says state and private schools are collaborating to a ""greater extent than ever before"" on music education, with independent schools being ""actively encouraged"" to share resources. But he says ""success will only be achieved when state and independent schools come together by their own free will"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow women and equalities minister Carolyn Harris welcomes every man in the chamber to the ""sisterhood"". She tells MPs that ""for too long the menopause has been...the punchline of a joke that is actually anything but funny"". Many women, she adds, are ""completely unprepared for this phase of their lives"". She calls for education for girls and boys on the menopause. She asks if the Department for Education would consider extending sexual health education guidance. Carolyn Harris also criticises the limited training given to doctors on the menopause, and its misdiagnosis as depression. She concludes by calling for a mandatory menopause policy within workplaces. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Marion Fellows jokes her daughter ""frequently accuses her of oversharing"" but adds: ""I've been there, I've done that, I've got the T-shirt"" She says she started early and the menopause felt like it went on for a long time. Ms Fellows says the menopause can have a psychological and physical impact on women and it is vital health professionals ""take them seriously"". The MP also says that it is ""not uncommon"" for women to experience sexual dysfunction during the menopause that can affect their relationships, self-confidence and mental health. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament The Earl of Clancarty, a crossbench peer, says the future of music and other arts is at stake, adding that it is ""getting a little frustrating, having to quote back to the department its own figures"". ""Music should not become the preserve of the rich,"" he says, but suggests this is the way things are going. He criticises the restrictions on accessibility to art subjects, with many schools only letting students study one arts subject, and 70% of secondary school music teachers being forced to also teach other subjects, which he calls ""a nonsense"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean calls the menopause ""one of the last taboos"". She tells MPs she is menopausal herself, and suffers from debilitating headaches. ""There is so much ignorance out there"", she says, adding that the menopause is ""not just hot flushes and night sweats"". ""This is not a women's issue"" she says, but ""a society issue"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer and chairman of the English Schools Orchestra Lord Lingfield says the fact that fewer children are receiving education in playing musical instruments is ""a worrying trend"". He says the 800 secondary schools which still have orchestras should be praised, but more needs to be done to ensure the idea is ""encouraged in all schools"". ""There needs to be a national plan for music education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who chairs a parliamentary group on classical music, says music graduates ""are very hard sought"" by employers, even outside of musical occupations. The discipline requires ""a tremendous amount of skill and focus"", he says. However, he adds that the value of music education has been ""overshadowed"" by a ""streamlined focus"" on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement Jones says the Music GCSE should be available in all schools, and the arts must not become the ""preserve of students at private schools"". ""We cannot afford to lose music education from schools, and the government must ensure we protect the teaching of music by taking the focus off of the English Baccalaureate,"" he says. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The debate on supermarket supply chains comes to a close, and MPs begin their second backbench business debate of the afternoon, on World Menopause Day. Opening the debate, Labour MP Martin Whitfield says recent research found half of working women found work difficult due to the menopause, with 10% giving up work altogether. ""The menopause is an occupational health issue that rests on the desks of managers, male managers as well as female managers"", he says. He concludes by asking men to ""take up the challenge"" of discussing the menopause with those close to them at home and the workplace, so women do not ""suffer in silence"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Opening the debate, Lord Black of Brentwood says musical education is ""dying a rapid death"" and has become ""only an option for the privileged"". The gap in provision between state and private schools is ""shameful"", he adds. There has been a 40% decrease in the number of students taking A-Level Music in the last eight years, he says, adding that much of the blame ""must be placed on the English Baccalaureate"". The qualification, he tells peers, ""has harmed all creative arts subjects"". ""Music is not an add-on, it is not a past time, it is not a nice-to-have, it is an important grounding to our society and is as important as maths and physics,"" he says. Exploitation in Supermarket Supply Chains Debate House of CommonsParliament Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins says the government is determined to end modern slavery ""in our communities and in the global economy"". She adds that since the ""landmark""  Modern Slavery Act, there have been more convictions and arrests every year, with 950 currently live. Ms Atkins adds that this year the government will invest at least Â£61m towards end modern slavery in the UK and abroad. ""No production line, however how far reaching, should ever involve the exploitation of human beings"", she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Brexit negotiations have hit a ""real problem"" over the issue of the Irish border, government sources have warned. Hopes of a breakthrough were raised when the Brexit secretary made an unscheduled trip to Brussels on Sunday. But talks faltered over the need for a back-up plan - known as the backstop - to avoid a hard border. Theresa May, who is briefing MPs, has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea. Ahead of a key summit of European leaders on Wednesday, the EU is believed to be seeking further reassurances that its internal market will be protected and that additional customs and regulatory checks can be carried out without the return of physical infrastructure on the border. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit and the 'battle for the union' Sunday's talks had broken down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland - if the UK's version wasn't ready in time, Downing Street sources indicated.

"Dominic Raab didn't go to Brussels on Sunday sure of wrapping up every loose end of the Brexit process, tying a ribbon on it and carrying it home to give Theresa May the best ever present at work first thing Monday morning. But officials who have been working away in Brussels all week, including until late on Saturday night, did feel the talks would benefit from a bit of political shoulder to shove them forward, and that decisive progress could have been possible. All week, they have been grappling with one central issue - although there are others unresolved alongside, you guessed it, what to do about the Irish border. The negotiators had made some steps forward, buton Sunday the required political progress didn't come. The talks between the two men were not acrimonious, I'm told, but they got stuck - gummed up in thedetails of the backstop we discuss so often here. The two sides can't agree over how, what is essentially an insurance policy, would apply to the whole of the UK, and its temporary nature. And while there may have been a sense in Brussels that Mrs May was moving towards them, after she talked of doing a deal in the ""national interest"" during last week, if anything the politics at home have got more fraught. Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Thursday's cabinet meeting ramped up concerns and gave Brexiteers another excuse to rattle their sabres. The DUP continues its warnings that it'd sink the administration rather than see the deal it fears done. Several cabinet ministers are thinking about whether they can go on. And, more to the point, different groups of Tory MPs with gripes about other policies are scenting opportunity as the government is so vulnerable. Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab met for brief talks on Sunday Any move for the PM has become both harder, and more urgent. Her party won't accept a proposal to keep the UK essentially in the customs union. Parliament is likely to block no deal. The EU won't accept her Chequers plan. Even loyal ministers are deeply worried - ""She is like a chess player who only has the king left - all she can do is move one square at a time until she is check-mated."" Talks among key officials in Brussels on Monday are cancelled for now. There are no plans at the moment for the Brexit secretary to go back. There are only three days until the EU leaders' meeting where Mrs May has the chance to rescue herself and the talks too. If, of course, the deal is done at the last minute, perhaps this will all be seen as the necessary theatrics. With hindsight, Sunday's comings and goings might just become part of Brexit's messy history - but there is principle at stake here, as well as the practical challenge of getting an accord. If no one's even talking, how can they expect to agree? 'Key issues remain' after Brexit talks What are the Brexit backstop options? What happens now that a deal's been done?

"The 310-mile long border separating Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and how it should look after Brexit has become a crucial issue With fewer than 200 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, the battle over Brexit is reaching dizzying heights of drama. But perhaps an unintended consequence of the debate is the growing battle over something else - the union. In particular, the sum of the UK and all its parts. With the Irish border the main sticking point in the talks, focus has turned to Northern Ireland's future. Listen to BBC Podlitical: Brexit, borders and backstops Reality Check: Red lines on Irish border May cannot recommend Brexit deal says DUP On Monday, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC that Brexit negotiations were ""turning into a battle for the union"". His party is at the heart ofthe disquiet over the so-called backstop(that's the insurance policy the EU wants, to ensure there's no hard Irish border if the UK and EU can't find another solution). The DUP's ""blood red"" line: No to anything that sees only Northern Ireland remaining aligned in some way to EU rules, and no to extra regulatory checks only in Northern Ireland. It fears anything that splits Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could pose a range of problems, including precipitating the eventual break-up of the union. Alex Kane, a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist Party, believes the pro-union argument would probably win a border poll if one was held, but he's critical of the DUP and unionism more widely for throwing out rhetoric - but not acting on it. DUP leader Arlene Foster met the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier last week - and has since said it appears more likely that Brexit will lead to a no deal outcome ""It's not enough to just say 'the battle for the union' is on,"" he says. ""You have to have a strategy, you have to be willing to engage. If you mention the phrase border poll to unionists, a lot of the time they dismiss it and say it won't happen."" But writer and former Labour special adviser, Kevin Meagher, says Brexit has been an ""accelerant"" in pushing forward the possibility of Irish reunification which he insists is almost an inevitability. ""Unionists find themselves riding two horses: standing true to what they believe in, but having to internalise that a united Ireland is a real prospect now,"" he says. The power to call a border poll rests with the Secretary of State Karen Bradley, who could do so at any time if it appears ""likely"" to her that a majority would vote in favour of it, butearlier this year she said the conditions had not been met. Kevin Meagher says Brexit makes it much more likely to happen, and that there are other contributing factors too: Lack of devolved government in NI for almost two years, due toa financial scandal over a green energy scheme Changing demographics in NI,which could see a Catholic majority by 2021 Liberalisation of Republic of Ireland onsocial issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion The prime minister has always insistedshe is a defender of the unionand that the ""precious bond"" between the UK's four nations is of great importance to her. Kevin Meagher thinks that when it comes to the final roll of the Brexit dice, Theresa May might have to upset her unionist allies. ""Some of those forces are alive already, given Scotland's previous independence vote. ""Brexit quickens the pace around these problems, but Theresa May's got to try and get the best deal, and by upsetting the DUP she can probably get a reasonable deal for rest of the UK."" Senior Scottish Conservatives David Mundell and Ruth Davidson have threatened to resign if Theresa May backs a deal that gives NI special arrangements It's not just the DUP that the prime minister risks upsetting. On Sunday, just as talks between EU and UK negotiators ground to a halt over the Irish border issue,senior Scottish Conservatives threatened mutinyif any Brexit deal included special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Their fear is that any new controls that separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could fuel the case for Scottish independence - another potential fracture in the union. But where does Sinn FÃ©in - the largest nationalist party in Stormont and who also holds seats in the Irish Parliament - figure into all of this? The party's leadership have stressed that they want to see a border poll by 2022, although they acknowledgeit would be much more complicated in the context of a hard Brexit or 'no deal' scenario. The party's MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir said fighting against a hard Brexit is a bigger priority for Sinn FÃ©in right now, than achieving a united Ireland - but acknowledged Brexit had strengthened his party's argument for one. Alex Kane thinks the prospect of Irish unity is ""once in a lifetime"", arguing that Sinn FÃ©in knows it has an opportunity now that may not come around again for a very long time if it is not successful. And Kevin Meagher's view is that a united Ireland has moved from being an aspiration for nationalists to an ""evidence-based proposition"" now. ""Brexit is massively destabilising for the British state, it would be like taking a fillet to the UK,"" he says. ""A hard Brexit would be the worst of all worlds for unionism - with all roads ultimately leading to one point: a border poll."" While the Stormont parties may be at odds and internal spats within the Conservatives and Labour rage on, much of what happens next with the union rests on what Theresa May does next. But could she become the British prime minister who ends up breaking up the UK? Kevin Meagher says she's in an incredibly difficult position, adding: ""Trying to judge her place in history, I don't envy her, I don't think anybody does."" While in Alex Kane's view, the prime minister has a stark choice: ""A deal in the best interests of the UK or the interests of one party."" Mrs May does not have much time left to decide.

""Disturbing"" cases have ""long been tolerated and concealed"", it says. Speaker John Bercow's office said the claims were ""serious"" and should be considered ""as a matter of urgency"".

Dame Laura described the House of Commons as a ""stark reminder of how bad things used to be"" and said there was a culture of ""deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence"". In her report, she detailed alleged sexual harassment by MPs, saying women reported being abused in ""vulgar, gender-related terms"". There were reports of ""inappropriate touching"", including men ""trying to kiss them, grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". There were ""frequent comments"" about women's appearance and suggestions that they should wear ""sexier clothing or more make-up"". ""Derogatory or lewd comments about women's anatomies"" were made, the report said. Staff reported being told off for using the ""wrong"" toilet or being being told to ""get out of the lift now"" because MPs wanted to use it. The effect of the alleged behaviour on some staff had been ""acutely distressing, long-lasting and, in some cases, devastating"". One staff member told the review: ""I felt physically sickâ¦.I would find myself crying in the toilets, I wasn't able to eat or sleep properly."" According to the report, other allegations of behaviour reported by members of staff included: being shouted at or belittled people swearing at them face to face or over the phone others being ""routinely unpleasant, overbearing or confrontational"" to them being constantly criticised or having derogatory remarks made about their work being told they are useless and humiliating them in front of others taunting, mocking or mimicking them While some managers had dealt effectively with complaints from women, Dame Laura said the majority received ""evasive responses, in which either their reports were questioned... or belittled"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Dame Laura said Mr Bercow and other people in positions of leadership, such as the clerk of the House of Commons and the director general of the House of Commons, should read the report ""very carefully"". 'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack Is Westminster culture really changing? MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans Senior figures, she said, needed to ask themselves ""do I understand that radical change is needed, can I deliver that and will the staff have confidence that I can deliver that change? ""If they can't answer yes honestly to those questions they should each of them be considering their position."" In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, Dame Laura said it was ""not a problem of the past, it's continuing"", adding that she was hearing a lot of information about ""things that are still going on"". A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said it was ""a serious report into a serious subject which deserves a serious response"". She added: ""The House of Commons Commission will meet as a matter of urgency in the coming days to consider the report and our response to it."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC News that the report's findings were ""not a surprise"" to her. ""I have seen sexism and sexist attitudes,"" she said. ""But people aren't going to pick on me because I'm not powerless. ""What we are talking about is a power imbalance."" By Chris Cook, BBC Newsnight policy editor Dame Laura was commissioned to conduct an independent investigation. She delivered a thunderbolt. This report, a response to the reports that Lucinda Day and I published in March, is uncompromising. If the House management commissioned it thinking that she would find that Newsnight had over-egged the problem, they will be sorely disappointed. She looked, as we did, at the treatment of the clerks - the apolitical staff who run the Commons and its committees. And she found, as we did, remarkable consistency in the accounts given by staff members about the problems in the House with bullying and harassment. There are some major conclusions she draws from her analysis of this dysfunctional workplace. She calls for a huge amount of change - after all, her analysis is that this is ""a culture that has actively sought to cover up such abusive conduct"". Read more from Chris Cook A separate ""review of of historical allegations"" is also under way, and in July MPs backed a new grievance procedure and behaviour code. But Dame Laura said it was ""difficult to envisage"" how solutions could be delivered under the current senior House administration. The House of Commons executive board said the report made ""difficult reading"" and added that there was no place for bullying and harassment. It said it was ""determined to learn lessons"" from the report, adding that it will meet on 22 October to consider the findings.

"This video can not be played 'We're having a baby!' The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant and is due to give birth next spring, Kensington Palace has revealed. The announcement came as Meghan, 37, and Prince Harry, 34, arrived in Sydney on Monday ahead of a 16-day tour of Australia and New Zealand. Kensington Palace said the couple, who got married in Windsor five months ago, were ""delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public"". Their baby will be seventh in line to the throne. Reaction to Harry and Meghan's pregnancy announcement Meghan: From actress to duchess Profile: Prince Harry Royal Family tree and line of succession The Queen and other senior royals were told about the pregnancy on Friday, when members of the Royal Family gathered in Windsor for Princess Eugenie's wedding. Meghan - who has had her 12 week scan - attended the wedding with Prince Harry, wearing a long, dark blue coat, which sparked speculation she could be expecting. That speculation intensified when she was seen clutching two large folders in front of her stomach asshe arrived in Sydney for the tour, which will also take in Fiji and Tonga. It is their first official royal tour since their wedding, which also took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Their first engagement is on Tuesday, when crowds of wellwishers are expected to congratulate the couple. The duke and duchess follow in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. The couple landed in Australia on Monday morning Meghan married Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May Their baby will be a first cousin of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis - but will not be a prince or princess themselves unless the Queen steps in ahead of the birth. Royal biographer Robert Hardman said the children will be lord and lady ""like the children of any other duke"", because Prince Harry is not in the direct line of succession. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall are all said to be ""delighted"" for the couple after learning of the pregnancy at Friday's wedding. All the royal baby pictures you could possibly want, in one place And the mother of the duchess, Doria Ragland, is ""very happy about this lovely news"" and ""looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild"". Prime Minister Theresa May has also congratulated the couple, saying: ""My warmest congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the happy news they are expecting a baby in the spring. Wishing them all the best."" UK journalists in Australia for the royal tour were told the news by phone from London shortly after their arrival, as shown in a photograph from royal expert Emily Nash.

There are not expected to be any changes to the itinerary for their trip, despite the duchess's pregnancy. They have taken advice about the risk of the Zika virus in the Pacific Islands. The virus is linked to severe birth defects and was declared as a global medical emergency by the World Health Organization in 2016. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention,externallist Fiji and Tonga as ""areas with risk of Zika infection"". Ideally, pregnant women should not travel to these areas but, if they do, they should talk to their doctor first and take measures to prevent mosquito bites. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent Nothing changes, said the Palace, the tour goes on as normal. And in a strictly literal sense they are right - none of the 70-odd planned engagements will be cancelled. Fiji and Tonga will still be part of the tour despite the doubts some have about pregnant travellers visiting, because of concerns over the Zika virus. Medical advice, says the Palace, has been taken. But in another sense, everything has changed. This is now the duchess's pregnancy tour - every step of the way she will be greeted with a new level of excitement and with some degree of concern. This was always going to be a high-profile tour - the news about the duchess's pregnancy will ratchet up the interest and the crowds. Bookmakers said they had already received bets on the baby's name, with Diana, Victoria and Alexander among the early favourites. Harry and Meghan had not made a secret of their desire to have a child. She had said, in a 2016 interview, that becoming a mother was on her ""bucket list"", while Harry said in their engagement interview: ""You know, I think one step at a time, and hopefully we'll start a family in the near future."" The duke and duchess made an official visit to Sussex earlier this month And on a trip to Belfast in March, two months before their wedding, the couple were shown a range of products for newborns, including a baby bath. ""I'm sure at some point we'll need the whole (lot),"" Meghan had said at the time. The duchess was shown a new range for newborns while on a trip to Belfast in March Harry and Meghan met on a blind date, arranged by a mutual friend, and got engaged 16 months later. The duchess had first found fame as an actress, playing Rachel Zane in US legal drama Suits, but gave up her career when she got married. Congratulations have poured in for the couple from around the world. Among those expressing their delight was Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who officiated at their wedding.

"This video can not be played The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Australia The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Sydney to begin an official visit to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. It is the couple's first official royal tour since getting married in May. The 16-day trip coincides with the fourth Invictus Games, beginning in Sydney on Saturday, and includes dozens of official events. Prince Harry and Meghan were met by a large media and security presence at the airport on Monday. They were driven to Admiralty House, the Sydney Harbour residence of Governor-General Peter Cosgrove - who is the Queen's representative in Australia. The couple follow in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. However, the couple did make an official overseas visitto Ireland in July. They travelled by motorcade to a residence on Sydney Harbour They will rest before beginning official duties on Tuesday. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the couple to Australia, describing the visit as exciting. ""It's really a visit with the people,"" she told local network Nine on Monday. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent From the outside, Australia may seem poised to become a republic. It is a successful, modern democracy with a strong national identity that has become home to people from across the globe. In reality, the debate over the monarchy here has been deferred to another day and the fascination with the royals remains strong. Princess Eugenie's recent wedding drew more than a million TV viewers, while Prince Harry's marriage in May was watched by four million Australians. These ratings don't equate to never-ending support for having a head of state nearly 16,000km (10,000 miles) away. But they do show that the celebrity appeal of the young royals is very real, and may only be magnified by the couple's time here. In the coming days, Prince Harry and Meghan will visit attractions including the Sydney Opera House, Taronga Zoo and Bondi Beach. They will also take day trips to Melbourne, drought-stricken NSW town Dubbo, and Queensland's Fraser Island. Princess Eugenie's wedding photos released Harry and Meghan thrill Sussex crowds Prince Harry aims to expand Invictus Games They will then spend a few days in Fiji and Tonga, before concluding the trip with four days in New Zealand. Prince Harry and Meghan were guests at Princess Eugenie's wedding on Friday For the duke, the tour marks a return visit to all four countries. The duchess has previously visited New Zealand as a tourist. Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, spent 18 days in Australia and New Zealand on an official tour in April 2014.

"Meghan Markle made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018 and becoming the Duchess of Sussex. Before meeting Prince Harry, she had been best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits. When she became a member of the Royal Family, she gave up her acting career - and immersed herself in the life of a working royal, using the platform to highlight the charities and causes close to her heart. She became a mother in May 2019 but within a year she and Prince Harry had stepped away as working members of the Royal Family and started a new life in North America. She and Prince Harry had their second child, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in June 2021. Born Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981, she grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles. Her mother's home is in an area known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"". Meghan went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age. At 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans."" Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey in March 2019 Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"". ""It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,"" she later said. ""I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality."" At 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication, near Chicago, in 2003. A stint working as an intern at the US embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby Meghan Markle's career in pictures How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner Five moments from Meghan's last Suits Her father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle. There were leading roles in TV movies such as When Sparks Fly and Dater's Handbook, and bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a ""briefcase girl"" on the US version of game show Deal or No Deal.

Meghan was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. Allow Twitter content?

In real life, Meghan's union with Prince Harry wasn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later. In September,it was reported,externalthat her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the Royal Family. In 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. Meghan said setting up the website was an attempt to ""reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment"" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In one post, she explained: ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works."" The site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: ""My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else."" Royal wedding: All you need to know Who will change - Meghan or the Royal Family? She also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. But she shut The Tig in April 2017, and deleted her social accounts January 2018. Her media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are important to her. Meghan taught children to paint with watercolours on a 2016 visit to Rwanda as a global ambassador for World Vision She tackled the issue of the stigma around menstrual health inan article for Time magazine,externalin March 2017 and was a global ambassador forWorld Vision Canada,external, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. Meghan's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon fora stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015,external. Commenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: ""While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must."" She has written about her pride in her mixed racial heritage Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. In anarticle for Elle magazine,external, she wrote: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. ""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" In late 2016, Prince Harry confirmed he was in relationship with Meghan -while issuing a statement accusing journalists of harassing her,external. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. After just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. In September 2017 Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine they were ""two people who are really happy and in love"". And in an interview that November,when their engagement was announced,Prince Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". Meghan and Prince Harry got married at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May 2018. The Queen gave them the title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Thousands of members of the public turned out for the couple's wedding Meghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days. The trip coincided with the coupleannouncing they were expecting their first baby. Meghan at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Suva, Fiji The duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. Harry and Meghan at Taronga Zoo in Sydney Meghan and Prince Harry at the unveiling of the Labalaba Statue in Nadi, Fiji In February 2019 the Duke and Duchess travelled to Morocco for a three-day visit In September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there. Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. Sophia Williams-De Bruyn was aged 18 when she helped lead about 20,000 protesters Prince Harry and Meghan met Nelson Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, at a reception in Johannesburg She also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems ""aggressive, confrontational and dangerous"". But by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside newsthat they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sundayfor publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father. This video can not be played Harry and Meghan's royal engagements When Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: ""He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category."" But the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births. In advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of ""royal superfans"" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal. And the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of  being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed). The very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: ""It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight."" Now you see them.... ...now you don't. Madame Tussauds removed Harry and Meghan from its royal set, leaving an empty space Amid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role. The announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. The cost to taxpayers of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's UK home at Frogmore Cottage reopened the debate about how the Royal Family is funded Then there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage,had been renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs.It waslater announced that Prince Harry had paid back the cost. Meghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time. At the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas 2019 It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. Amid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment aspalace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consultedbefore the statement was issued. The couple's final engagement as working royals saw them in the familiar surroundings of Westminster Abbey Talks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queento iron out the detailsbefore it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020. The very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed ""Megxit"" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David. Prince Harry bumped forearms with Craig David when they met at the end of the service - while Meghan opted to hug him In February 2021, before a formal review of the situation had begun,Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be returningas working members of the Royal Family. It meant Prince Harry and Meghan would return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. The couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties. After time was spent in Canada, the couple settled at a new home in California. It has allowed them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state. But they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home. The same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. But they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in. As a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Meghan was joined be her mother, Doria Ragland, and Prince Harry for the cookbook launch After moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of ""structural racism"" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should""reject hate"". In November 2020, Meghanwrote an article,externalrevealing her ""almost unbearable grief"" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year. As for their future career plans, a big clue came when theyreached a deal with streaming giant Netflixto make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Meghan and Prince Harry featured in a succession of headlines in February 2021. At the High Court in London,Meghan won her claim for misuse of private informationagainst the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.  A further hearing will decide the ""next steps"" in her legal action which covers claims of copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. Days laterMeghan and Prince Harry announced they were expecting their second child. Then came the news the couple had decided to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy, in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a statement fromBuckingham Palace that it would investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staffin 2018. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"" - and the following day a clip from her Winfrey interview was issued by CBS in whichMeghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silentif it was ""perpetuating falsehoods about us"". In June, Meghanhad her first daughter, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, and she and Prince Harry said Lili ""is more than we could have ever imagined"". The couple named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. And her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, they said.

"This video can not be played 'Miss M' tells 5 Live Breakfast how she won Â£80,000 in damages from a man who had been cleared of raping her A woman who sued her rapist in a civil court has called the criminal trial which freed her attacker a ""disgrace"". The 23-year-old victim, known as ""Miss M"",was awarded Â£80,000 in damages in Octoberafter a five-year fight for justice. She sued Stephen Coxen from Bury in Greater Manchester . The second year student said she was raped after a night out in St Andrews in 2013 by Mr Coxen, who she had met earlier in the evening. Mr Coxen, now 23, had denied the charges and in November 2015 a jury found the case against himnot proven. In a legal first in Scotland,  a sheriff in the civil action ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman, known as Miss M, and demanded he pay damages. Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. Miss M has told the BBC she was ""let down"" by the Crown in her criminal trial and she felt she was not involved in the case. Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court She toldVictoria Derbyshire: ""A civil action has a lower burden of proof but why did we have more expert witnesses and more evidence than we did in a criminal trial where the burden of proof is different? ""Honestly, my own opinion is that I was let down in the criminal justice process."" She added: ""I think my case wasn't investigated as well as it could have been and I think it is shocking that someone - me - that's been through the case, who has lived every moment of the incident was not involved in any decisions, any input of witnesses, anything. I felt so let down by that. ""From the disgrace of the criminal justice process and how the Crown represented my case, I think the Crown failed in that. ""Hopefully they will look into other cases in the future and other women won't have to go through the fight that I had to go through."" During the civil trial at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh, Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of her when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. The sheriff heard that Mr Coxen, who was then 18, had driven up from Manchester to visit a friend at St Andrews University. Mr Coxen met Miss M, who was an 18-year-old student, at the Lizard Lounge in the town. She is reported to have been seen kissing with Mr Coxen in the club's smoking lounge. Mr Coxen was ejected from the premises close to 02:00, after being involved in an altercation. The woman bringing the case was a student at the University of St Andrews Miss M's next memory was standing at the gates outside her flat beside a man she didn't know. She rang the buzzer, hoping that her flatmates would answer. Mr Coxen became frustrated as she ""played for time"", searching in her bag for the house keys. Miss M then dropped her keys. Mr Coxen unlocked the gate himself and used the keys to gain entry to the flat, where he raped her. Over the next few months, Miss M is said to have been prescribed a number of different types of medication to deal with depression, panic attacks and sleep disturbance. She reported the attack in January 2014. Mr Coxen denied rape and said they had consensual sex. Rape Crisis Scotland's chief executive Sandy Brindley agreed the victim's lack of involvement in criminal proceedings was not acceptable. She said; ""Miss M has described being on the periphery of the case. Part of that difficulty comes from being a witness to a crime committed against you, so you don't have any standing in the case."" Ms Brindley believes the Scottish not proven verdict is also a significant issue. She said: ""It is used commonly in rape trials and there is a worry that juries might be reluctant to convict in rape cases and the not proven verdict gives them an easy out."" She also saidthe Scottish government had started some researchinto jury decision-making in rape trials. She explained: ""One of the things they are considering is if juries understand what the not proven verdict means. Sandy Brindley from Rape Crisis thinks the not proven verdict is ""an easy out"" in a rape trial ""It has the exact same impact as a not guilty verdict. It is an acquittal. ""There are no consequences at all for the accused from the not proven verdict. ""It means there is not enough evidence to find guilty but they haven't felt able to go for a not guilty verdict. It is just as devastating as a not guilty verdict for a victim."" A Crown Office spokesman said: ""Stephen Coxen was prosecuted in the High Court and was acquitted by a jury following trial. ""Prosecutors take crimes of rape and sexual offences extremely seriously and we are committed to ensuring that all such cases are investigated thoroughly and sensitively and are prosecuted appropriately. ""Victims of such offences can be confident that they will be treated with the utmost professionalism and sensitivity by everyone involved in the investigation and prosecution and we will do all we can to deliver justice for them. ""We note the judgement of the court in the civil case."" After her legal victory, Miss M said she was relieved that now someone had acknowledged the actions of Stephen Coxen were wrong and unlawful. She is now vowing to fight for others. She said: ""I was a victim but now I am a survivor and for me it is about moving on. I am never going to stop fighting for other women. ""I can and I will continue to try to help other people who have been wrongly subjected to something like Stephen Coxen did to me.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works Fracking for shale gas has begun for the first time in the UK since it waslinked with earthquakes in 2011. Energy firm Cuadrilla confirmed the controversial process had started at its site in Little Plumpton, Lancashire aftera legal challenge failedon Friday. Protester Ginette Evans said there was a ""mood of disappointment"" but insisted the  fight was ""not over"". Cuadrilla insisted the process was safe and would be of ""enormous"" benefit. The company's chief executive Francis Egan said: ""These are the first exploration wells that will be tested... we have high hopes for them but we have to wait and see what comes out."" If successful, he said it would ""lead to tens of thousands of jobs and could be a very significant contributor to the exchequer and... could also reduce emissions because it will be better than importing gas from far afield"".

The energy firm confirmed in a statement at 13:15 BST that it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells, and then it would test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable. If it is, up to 20 wells could be built. Two protesters closed Preston New Road earlier when they cemented their arms together in a tyre and sat down in the middle of the road. They have since been cut free by police. Another demonstrator climbed on to scaffolding on top of a van at the entrance to Cuadrilla's Little Plumpton site. They were served with contempt of court notices for breaching theinjunction Cuadrilla obtainedpreventing trespassers from entering land where fracking is taking place. Allow Twitter content?

""We will do whatever we can to halt [Cuadrilla] in their tracks,"" he added.

He said the industry had ""huge scope"" and could be as big a contributor to the Lancashire economy as BAE Systems. Cat Smith, Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, tweeted: ""Future generations will look back at this and wonder why we didn't heed climate change warnings."" ""The Tories have slashed support for small scale renewables, scaled back support for electric vehicles and are being slammed by a leading climate scientist for its pursuit of fracking."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills said: ""Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well paid, quality jobs. ""We have been clear that any shale developments must be safe and environmentally sound."" This video can not be played Judith Moritz shows us around one of the UK's first horizontal exploration wells By Roger Harrabin Environment Analyst The resumption of fracking falls on the day the government launches Green GB week to highlight technologies that combat climate change. So how can the government stimulate fracking, while also pursuing zero greenhouse gas emissions? Well, let's look at the timescales. The first fossil fuel to be banished from the UK is coal. Next will be oil. Gas is least damaging so it will be last. Experts anticipate the UK will be using dwindling amounts of gas until the middle of the century. Climate minister Claire Perry asks: ""Why would you want to import gas when you could create your own?"" Environmentalists say this argument is flawed. They believe by the time the UK develops a shale gas industry it'll be time to close it down. Second they point out that coal, oil and gas firms have already discovered enough fossil fuels underground to overheat the planet three times over - and a shale gas industry would only add to the problem. But the Treasury sniffs potential tax revenues and its arguments have won the day in government. Inside a fracking site.

"Ian and Stuart Paton's pumpkin weighs a whopping 2,433.9lb Twin brothers have squashed their own record for the UK's heaviest pumpkin grown indoors. Ian and Stuart Paton, 57, broke their existing record with a giant 174 stone (1,105kg) vegetable at the Jubilee Sailing Trust Pumpkin Festival in Netley, Southampton, on Saturday. Their previous record of 162 stone (1,028.7kg) was set last year. The pair, who have been growing pumpkins since they were 11, hope to smash the world record one day. The world record for the heaviest pumpkin currently stands at 187 stone (1,187.5kg) and was achieved in Germany in October 2016. ""We're certainly heading in the right direction,"" said Ian, who runs a flower nursery with his brother in Lymington. Describing pumpkins as ""awesome"", he added: ""The first pumpkin we grew was 54lb, now we watch them grow at 60lb a day."" The brothers had previously grown a 162 stone pumpkin The brothers' winning squash is a hybrid and was ""crossed with the very best [pumpkins] in the world"". Ian said the other secret to growing monster pumpkins was ""very light open soil"" and ""plenty of water in the summer"". The pumpkin will now travel to London to be displayed at an exhibition in Covent Garden, before its seeds are harvested to be grown next year.

"This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist US President Donald Trump has suggested ""rogue killers"" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking to reporters after a phone call with King Salman, he said the Saudi leader had firmly denied knowing what had happened to Mr Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is flying to Saudi Arabia immediately. Turkish police have, for the first time, been inside the Saudi consulate where Mr Khashoggi was last seen. They entered the building around an hour after a group of Saudi officials. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents nearly two weeks ago but Riyadh has always strongly denied this. However,unconfirmed reports in the US media,externalsuggest Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong and that the original intention had been to abduct him. Meanwhile, Arabic channel Al-Jazeera quotes Turkey's attorney-general's office as saying it has found evidence to back claims that Mr Khashoggi was killed inside the mission. The issue has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with its closest Western allies. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Donald Trump and a world of disorder Mr Trump addressed snatched questions from reporters over helicopter engine noise at the White House, describing King Salman's denial as ""very, very strong"". ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" he added. ""Who knows?"" The president provided no evidence to back his comment. A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials have audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi was murdered inside the building. On Saturday, Mr Trump threatened Saudi Arabia with ""severe punishment""if it emerged that Mr Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate but ruled out halting big military contracts with Riyadh. Secretary of State Pompeo's visit to Saudi Arabia will be followed by a stop in Turkey. Diplomatic pressure is growing on the Saudis to give a fuller explanation. On Monday, King Salman ordered an investigation into the case. ""The king has ordered the public prosecutor to open an internal investigation into the Khashoggi matter based on the information from the joint team in Istanbul,"" an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Saudi officials arrived before the Turkish investigators The official said the prosecutor had been instructed to work quickly. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Last week, Turkey accepted a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. On Sunday,Riyadh angrily rejected political and economic ""threats""over the case of the missing journalist and said it would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"". Investigators entered the building in Istanbul on Monday afternoon - first a Saudi team followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police.

Saudi Arabia agreed last week to allow Turkish officials to conduct a search but insisted it would only be a superficial ""visual"" inspection. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi Turkey rejected that offer. The Sabah daily newspaper said investigators had wanted to search the building with luminol, a chemical which shows up any traces of blood. It is not clear whether that happened. King Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone on Sunday evening, officials said, and stressed the importance of the two countries working together on the case. By Frank Gardner, BBC News Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have been rallying round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar. He has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who has written for the Washington Post, was last seen walking into the consulate on 2 October. Reports suggest an assault and struggle took place in the consulate after Mr Khashoggi went to get paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Turkish sources allege he was killed by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents but Riyadh insists that he left the consulate unharmed. Mr Khashoggi was once an adviser to the Saudi royal family but fell out of favour with the Saudi government and went into self-imposed exile. He is a US resident. The European Union has joined calls for a transparent investigation. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini briefed reporters after a meeting of the 28 foreign ministers. ""There was full consensus around the table on the fact that we expect transparency, we expect full clarity from investigations to be done by the Saudi authorities together and in full co-operation with the Turkish authorities,"" she said. Meanwhile, moreleading business figures say they will not attend a major investment conference in Riyadhlater this month. What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? The international conference, starting on 23 October, has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", though the World Economic Forum says it has nothing to do with its annual event in the Swiss Alps. Officially entitled the Future Finance Initiative, the Saudi conference describes itself as an ""international platform for expert-led debate between investors, innovators and governments as well as economic leaders"". Significantly, it was expected to showcase the reform agenda of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, is one of the latest high-profile executives to pull out. Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi are also among those who will not be attending the conference. A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the event's website. It is still unclear whether US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will attend the conference.

"GPs in England are being given permission to prescribe patients ""social"" activities, such as dance classes, to tackle loneliness. The strategy, announced by Prime Minister Theresa May, will also see postal delivery workers checking in on isolated people during their rounds. The government says about 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in over a month. And many GPs see between one and five people a day suffering with loneliness. As part of the long-term plan, funding will be provided to connect NHS patients in England to a variety of activities, such as cookery classes, walking clubs and art groups, by 2023. Announcing an extra Â£1.8m for community projects, such as creating new community cafes, art spaces or gardens, Mrs May said social prescriptions would reduce demand on the NHS and improve patients' quality of life. The government will also partner with the Royal Mail on a new scheme in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby to give postal workers a front-line role in tackling loneliness. And a network of  businesses - including Sainsbury's, Transport for London, the Co-op, British Red Cross, National Grid and Civil Service - have pledged to take further action to support their employees' health and social wellbeing. Mrs Cox was MP for Batley and Spen from 2015 until her murder the following year Launching the first loneliness strategy, Mrs May said: ""This strategy is only the beginning of delivering a long and far reaching social change in our country - but it is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our lifetimes."" She paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her death: ""Jo Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental wellbeing as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. ""I was pleased to be able to support the Loneliness Commission set up in Jo's name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations."" Kim Leadbeater, Ms Cox's sister, on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: ""The important thing now is to turn the dialogue and strategy into action. ""That is undoubtedly what Jo would want and for every life that is made less lonely as a result of the work she started and that we have all continued, we will take great comfort. ""I look forward to this happening in the coming months and years.""

It predicts rising health problems by 2030 without changes in policy. An NHS England spokeswoman said the report provided ""useful context"" for its long-term funding plan. The plan is set to be published this year. Currently, children in England are measured at primary school,up to the ages of 10 and 11, but not after that. The report, Child Health in 2030 in England, says more needs to be done to halt obesity. It compared different aspects of children and young people's health in England with 14 other European Union countries plus Australia, Canada and Norway. The report found England has poorer health outcomes than the average across those 18 countries and, based on recent trends, is likely to fall further behind them over the next decade. The report highlighted: high mortality for one to 19-year-olds in England and Wales for respiratory conditions like asthma and epilepsy higher proportions of young mothers and smoking during pregnancy low rates of breastfeeding compared to most EU countries mental health problems set to increase by 2030 a third of boys living in the poorest areas of England will be obese by 2030 A&E attendances for children and young people are high and set to rise in the next 12 years Poverty lies at the root of many major child health challenges, the report says, and a properly-funded health strategy focused on children and young people would help turn things around. It says England has seen some successes - in how diabetes is controlled, in rapidly reducing smoking rates among young people and low numbers of death from injuries. And it acknowledges that the government'schildhood obesity planis likely to ""help to reverse current obesity trends"". The report makes a series of recommendations, including: extending the current asthma register to include children from five to 18 years old recording the weight, height and BMI of all children two to 18 years old on an electronic growth chart once a year making the ""red book"", a child's health record, available online publishing information on how much funding is allocated for children and young people's physical and mental health services and how it is spent developing a children and young people's health strategy for England investing more in school nursing and health visiting services organising local child mental health systems so that they are delivered as close as possible to home Prof Russell Viner, report author and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""This report clearly identifies the danger on the horizon - but trends shown here are not inevitable. ""Each of them could be turned around if key actions are undertaken."" He said it was ""hugely encouraging"" that child and maternal health had been highlighted in the NHS England long-term plan, which is published soon. He added the plan was ""a crucial opportunity for improving child health"". ""Act now or the consequences are grave,"" was Prof Viner's message to policy-makers. Alana Ryan, from the NSPCC, said it was unacceptable that so many children were unable to access help mental health support from local services when they needed it most. ""Young people's mental and emotional wellbeing must be a top priority in the new NHS England strategy."" The Royal College of Nursing said the report painted ""a bleak picture for children and young people"". And it said health visitors and school nurses were ""the front-line defence against childhood obesity and poor child mental health"" but all too often they were understaffed. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Improving children's mental and physical health is a key priority for this government and will be pivotal in our long term plan for the NHS, which we're backing with additional funding of an extra Â£20.5 billion a year by 2023/24.""

"This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist US President Donald Trump has suggested ""rogue killers"" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking to reporters after a phone call with King Salman, he said the Saudi leader had firmly denied knowing what had happened to Mr Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is flying to Saudi Arabia immediately. Turkish police have, for the first time, been inside the Saudi consulate where Mr Khashoggi was last seen. They entered the building around an hour after a group of Saudi officials. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents nearly two weeks ago but Riyadh has always strongly denied this. However,unconfirmed reports in the US media,externalsuggest Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong and that the original intention had been to abduct him. Meanwhile, Arabic channel Al-Jazeera quotes Turkey's attorney-general's office as saying it has found evidence to back claims that Mr Khashoggi was killed inside the mission. The issue has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with its closest Western allies. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Donald Trump and a world of disorder Mr Trump addressed snatched questions from reporters over helicopter engine noise at the White House, describing King Salman's denial as ""very, very strong"". ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" he added. ""Who knows?"" The president provided no evidence to back his comment. A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials have audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi was murdered inside the building. On Saturday, Mr Trump threatened Saudi Arabia with ""severe punishment""if it emerged that Mr Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate but ruled out halting big military contracts with Riyadh. Secretary of State Pompeo's visit to Saudi Arabia will be followed by a stop in Turkey. Diplomatic pressure is growing on the Saudis to give a fuller explanation. On Monday, King Salman ordered an investigation into the case. ""The king has ordered the public prosecutor to open an internal investigation into the Khashoggi matter based on the information from the joint team in Istanbul,"" an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Saudi officials arrived before the Turkish investigators The official said the prosecutor had been instructed to work quickly. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Last week, Turkey accepted a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. On Sunday,Riyadh angrily rejected political and economic ""threats""over the case of the missing journalist and said it would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"". Investigators entered the building in Istanbul on Monday afternoon - first a Saudi team followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. Turkish diplomatic sources had said the consulate would be searched by a joint Turkish-Saudi team. A group of cleaners was seen entering earlier. Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia agreed last week to allow Turkish officials to conduct a search but insisted it would only be a superficial ""visual"" inspection. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi Turkey rejected that offer. The Sabah daily newspaper said investigators had wanted to search the building with luminol, a chemical which shows up any traces of blood. It is not clear whether that happened. King Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone on Sunday evening, officials said, and stressed the importance of the two countries working together on the case. By Frank Gardner, BBC News Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have been rallying round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar. He has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who has written for the Washington Post, was last seen walking into the consulate on 2 October. Reports suggest an assault and struggle took place in the consulate after Mr Khashoggi went to get paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Turkish sources allege he was killed by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents but Riyadh insists that he left the consulate unharmed. Mr Khashoggi was once an adviser to the Saudi royal family but fell out of favour with the Saudi government and went into self-imposed exile. He is a US resident. The European Union has joined calls for a transparent investigation. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini briefed reporters after a meeting of the 28 foreign ministers. ""There was full consensus around the table on the fact that we expect transparency, we expect full clarity from investigations to be done by the Saudi authorities together and in full co-operation with the Turkish authorities,"" she said. Meanwhile, moreleading business figures say they will not attend a major investment conference in Riyadhlater this month. What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? The international conference, starting on 23 October, has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", though the World Economic Forum says it has nothing to do with its annual event in the Swiss Alps. Officially entitled the Future Finance Initiative, the Saudi conference describes itself as an ""international platform for expert-led debate between investors, innovators and governments as well as economic leaders"". Significantly, it was expected to showcase the reform agenda of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, is one of the latest high-profile executives to pull out. Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi are also among those who will not be attending the conference. A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the event's website. It is still unclear whether US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will attend the conference.

"GPs in England are being given permission to prescribe patients ""social"" activities, such as dance classes, to tackle loneliness. The strategy, announced by Prime Minister Theresa May, will also see postal delivery workers checking in on isolated people during their rounds. The government says about 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in over a month. And many GPs see between one and five people a day suffering with loneliness. As part of the long-term plan, funding will be provided to connect NHS patients in England to a variety of activities, such as cookery classes, walking clubs and art groups, by 2023. Announcing an extra Â£1.8m for community projects, such as creating new community cafes, art spaces or gardens, Mrs May said social prescriptions would reduce demand on the NHS and improve patients' quality of life. The government will also partner with the Royal Mail on a new scheme in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby to give postal workers a front-line role in tackling loneliness. And a network of  businesses - including Sainsbury's, Transport for London, the Co-op, British Red Cross, National Grid and Civil Service - have pledged to take further action to support their employees' health and social wellbeing. Mrs Cox was MP for Batley and Spen from 2015 until her murder the following year Launching the first loneliness strategy, Mrs May said: ""This strategy is only the beginning of delivering a long and far reaching social change in our country - but it is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our lifetimes."" She paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her death: ""Jo Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental wellbeing as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. ""I was pleased to be able to support the Loneliness Commission set up in Jo's name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations."" Kim Leadbeater, Ms Cox's sister, on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: ""The important thing now is to turn the dialogue and strategy into action. ""That is undoubtedly what Jo would want and for every life that is made less lonely as a result of the work she started and that we have all continued, we will take great comfort.

"The car is essentially built; it just needs funding to go and set records The project to race a car at over 1,000mph has run into a financial roadblock with the company behind the venture going into administration. TheBloodhound supersonic vehicle,externalis all but built but needs a Â£25m investment if it is to break records on a dried-out lakebed in South Africa. The administrators,FRP Advisory LLP,external, have already begun to talk to potential suitors and want to hear from others. But without the funds the project faces being wound up in the coming weeks. Bloodhound is using the same jet technology as in the Eurofighter-Typhoon Bloodhound is, by any measure, the most sophisticated land speed record car ever conceived. To be powered by a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine bolted to a rocket, it should easily smash the existing world mark of 763mph (1,228km/h). And computer simulations indicate it ought to be capable of going much, much faster still. But although all the R&D is done, with the car even conducting some low-speed trials - the project simply cannot now move forward into its end phase unless the necessary funding is in place. ""This is the situation,"" explained Andrew Sheridan from FRP Advisory LLP's Bristol office. ""We have a legal entity that has gone into administration because it hasn't got any more cash. But there is a project there that is very much alive and on the cusp of delivering its goal, which is ground-breaking with leading technology. ""However, it does need circa Â£25m to get it over the line, and that now requires an investor, be that a wealthy individual or a corporate of some kind,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year Bloodhound is a private undertaking. It is funded through donation, sponsorship and partnership. Bloodhound has excelled at leveraging all three, but ultimately this funding model has not delivered sufficient cash to fully sustain such a complex venture. The last two-to-three years have been an especially tough environment in which to raise financial support. The investment landscape is difficult, in part because of Brexit uncertainty, but principally because many large brands that might once have put their name on the side of a car to build awareness are now using other marketing tools, such as social media. By going into administration, Bloodhound Programme Ltd, the company behind Project Bloodhound, gets some breathing space to allow it to find a solution. Supporters have paid to have their names printed on the tail fin The main structure of the vehicle is built, and last October Bloodhound conducted shakedown runs, topping 200mph (320km/h) on the runway at Newquay airport in Cornwall. The track on which it intends to break the land speed record is also ready to host the car. The Northern Cape Government in South Africa has had an 18km-long, 1,500m-wide section of Hakskeen Pan cleared of stones. And, significantly, the one major element in the technical package that was outstanding has just demonstrated its readiness. This is the rocket that would go in the back of Bloodhound to push it through the sound barrier. Developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo, it was launched to space for the first time at the end of September. The Nucleus rocket flew to an altitude of 107km from the AndÃ¸ya Space Center. Bloodhound would use a cluster of three Nucleus motors in addition to the Eurofighter EJ200 jet. ""Once we have the funding in place, or at least visibility of that funding, and the team is back in the building, then 10 months later we're out in South Africa,"" said Mark Chapman, Bloodhound's chief engineer. ""We're that close. This is a huge opportunity for global exposure. Nammo firing that motor was really important, really impressive."" Nammo's rocket had a flawless first outing last month If the Â£25m becomes available, Bloodhound could start running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the lakebed has evaporated the seasonal rains and the ground has become bone dry. The current plan is to run the car in the first instance in the region of 500-600mph (800-965km/h), using just the Eurofighter jet, to get a better sense of how the car behaves as it approaches the speed of sound. The team would then wait for another rain season to pass before returning to Hakskeen with the addition of a Nammo motor to raise the land speed record above 800mph, and then ultimately to over 1,000mph. So, that would probably mean running in 2020 and again in 2021. Having fun, learning Bloodhound was launched in 2008 as a ""vehicle"" to get children excited about science and engineering, and to persuade them of the benefits of entering technical careers. This STEM campaign was one of the reasons big engineering firms got involved because they saw the project as a means to promote their apprenticeship schemes. To date, this""education adventure"",externalhas reached over two million children, including 120,000 schoolchildren in the UK each year. The education side of things is unaffected by Monday's news because it is organised as a charity; it has separate sources of income. The current world land speed record was set in 1997 by the Thrust Super Sonic Car. The UK team behind it was led by Bloodhound's Project Director, Richard Noble. Thrust's driver, Andy Green, is also the pilot for Bloodhound.

"Donald Trump has said he does believe the climate is changing US President Donald Trump has accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"" as he cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. But Mr Trump also said he no longer believed climate change was a hoax. The comments, made during an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, come less than a week after climate scientists issued a final call to halt rising temperatures. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced. Last week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - warnedthe world was heading towards a temperature rise of 3C. Scientists say that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity - which has caused approximately 1C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' 'Climate change moving faster than we are' What could disappear on 'Hothouse Earth' The report said keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". Climate change was just one issue touched on during the wide-ranging interview,external, during which Mr Trump also: Said that ""the day before"" he took office the US had been on the verge of ""going to war with North Korea"" Said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""probably"" involved in assassinations but added, ""I rely on them, it's not in our country"" Said Russia had meddled in the 2016 elections but added, ""I think China meddled also"" Refused to say whether he would reinstate the migrant child separation policy but added ""there have to be consequences"" for entering the US illegally Said he believed he had treated Christine Blasey Ford with ""respect"" aftermocking her testimony in front of thousands at a rally, and that ""had I not made that speech, we would not have won"" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons During Sunday's interview, Mr Trump cast doubt on making any changes, saying the scientists ""have a very big political agenda"". ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference,"" he told journalist Lesley Stahl. ""But I don't know that it's manmade. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't want to be put at a disadvantage."" Mr Trump added that temperatures ""could very well go back"" - although he did not say how. He said climate change was a hoax during his election campaign in 2016 but has generally avoided taking a clear stance on the issue since taking office. However, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. At the time,Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" dealthat would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. It sparked speculation that the former reality television star still believed climate change had been invented. However, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, later said Mr Trump ""believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation"". The report released last week by the IPCC says climate change can only be stopped if the world makes major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7m square miles) for land energy crops. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world If the world fails to act, the researchers warn, there will be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. By Roger Harrabin BBC Environment Analyst President Trump's views on climate change have swung widely - like his comments on many issues. Vanishingly few informed scientists now disagree that humans have been driving recent climate change, and that further heating will create serious risks for the climate. They don't expect the climate will materially cool again in a natural cycle. The president says he doesn't want to spend trillions of dollars and lose millions of jobs by cutting emissions. Of course he doesn't - but all governments feel the same way. Instead, they are trying to reframe the huge investment needed in renewable energy as a money-making enterprise. The UK's Industrial Strategy, for instance, sets out to create jobs in clean industries to replace those lost in dirty factories. And in the US itself,the solar industry is creating far more jobs than the coal sector,external. Does the president know that?

"Harry and Meghan are expecting a baby in the spring The couple are beginning their first royal tour together in Sydney, Australia They are ""delighted to share this happy news"" Katie Wright and Claire Heald Thank you for following our live coverage of the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan are expecting their first child. Keep up to date with all the latest news here:  Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Nothing changes, said the Palace, the tour goes on as
normal. And in a strictly literal sense they are right - none of the 70-odd engagements that were planned will be cancelled. Fiji and Tonga will still be part of the tour, despite the doubts some have
about pregnant travellers visiting because of concerns over the Zika
virus. Medical advice, says the Palace, has been taken. But in another sense, everything has changed. This is now the Duchess' pregnancy tour - every step of the way she will be
greeted with a new level of excitement and with some degree of concern. This was always going to be a high-profile tour - the news about her pregnancy will ratchet up the interest and the crowds. The announcement that Prince Harry was expecting his first child coincided with him arriving in Australia to launch the fourth Invictus Games in Sydney on Friday. He founded the Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen and servicewomen and veterans in 2014. Prince Harry has grown up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military and, most recently, his charity work. Here is an in-depth look at the 34-year-old. This video can not be played Meghan and Harry: Couple's baby due in Spring 2019 The Duchess of Sussex's mother, Doria Ragland, says she is ""very happy about this lovely news"" following the announcement that her daughter is pregnant. She says she ""looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild"". The announcement of another royal baby on the way came as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Sydney ahead of a 16-day tour of Australia and New Zealand. The duchess is due to give birth next spring. She made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018. Here is everything you need to know about the 37-year-old American. Bookmakers are already speculating on what the name of Prince Harry and Meghan's first child will be. Some have Diana leading the way with odds of 16/1, followed by Elizabeth, Phillip and Henry. James and Victoria are also up there. But Theresa and Donald are lagging, with some putting those topical choices at 150/1. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby will be seventh in line to the throne - moving Prince Harry's uncle, the Duke of York, down into eighth
place. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of
Wessex - the Queen's youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time. See the Royal Family tree and line of successionhere. The couple are there for a royal tour Allow Twitter content?

"David Carroll was handed a 26-week suspended prison sentence for fraud by false representation A woman whose husband pretended to have cancer has said his years of lying ""stole so much of my life"". Lucy Witchard, of Leicester, said David Carroll, 35, told her he had leukaemia when they met in 2006 - they married in 2011 and have since divorced. She said in 2015 her mother gave him Â£2,000 for treatment in the US after he said the cancer was terminal. Carroll was given a suspended prison sentence for fraud at Leicester Magistrates' Court last week. During their four years of marriage, Carroll had also lied about having prostate and stomach cancer, but later admitted this, Ms Witchard said. She told the BBC Carroll would not allow her to attend chemotherapy sessions in hospital and frequently said the leukaemia got better and worse.

""When I questioned his treatment he threatened to leave me saying our relationship could not work if I didn't trust him."" Latest news from the East Midlands The family became suspicious while Carroll was in the US - enjoying a holiday rather than receiving cancer treatment. The 31-year-old said she confronted him on his return but he went ""ballistic"" and tried to keep up the pretence. ""He even got a work friend to call me pretending to be his doctor,"" she said.

The death toll has been revised down from 13, France's interior ministry explained, because of an error which meant some of the dead had been counted twice. Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude, said people were stranded on rooftops and would have to be evacuated by air because it was too dangerous by boat. Hurricane-force winds rip through Portugal France country profile One person was injured, he added, when a house collapsed in the locality of Cuxac. The floods are the worst the Aude river has seen in more than 100 years, according to the weather monitoring service Vigicrues. Hundreds of emergency service workers are taking part in rescue efforts Seven helicopters and 700 emergency service workers have been deployed, according to France's Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe, who has also visited the area. An angry resident of Villegailhenc told the prime minister there had been a lack of public information, including from the media, when flooding hit in the early hours. People on social media have also been sharing photos showing the extent of the damage to homes and streets in the area. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"Children and young people up to 18 should have their weight and body mass index (BMI) recorded every year, says a report by child health experts. TheRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalsays England is falling behind other countries on obesity, mental health and infant deaths. It predicts rising health problems by 2030 without changes in policy. An NHS England spokeswoman said the report provided ""useful context"" for its long-term funding plan. The plan is set to be published this year. Currently, children in England are measured at primary school,up to the ages of 10 and 11, but not after that. The report, Child Health in 2030 in England, says more needs to be done to halt obesity. It compared different aspects of children and young people's health in England with 14 other European Union countries plus Australia, Canada and Norway. The report found England has poorer health outcomes than the average across those 18 countries and, based on recent trends, is likely to fall further behind them over the next decade. The report highlighted: high mortality for one to 19-year-olds in England and Wales for respiratory conditions like asthma and epilepsy higher proportions of young mothers and smoking during pregnancy low rates of breastfeeding compared to most EU countries mental health problems set to increase by 2030 a third of boys living in the poorest areas of England will be obese by 2030 A&E attendances for children and young people are high and set to rise in the next 12 years Poverty lies at the root of many major child health challenges, the report says, and a properly-funded health strategy focused on children and young people would help turn things around. It says England has seen some successes - in how diabetes is controlled, in rapidly reducing smoking rates among young people and low numbers of death from injuries. And it acknowledges that the government'schildhood obesity planis likely to ""help to reverse current obesity trends"". The report makes a series of recommendations, including: extending the current asthma register to include children from five to 18 years old recording the weight, height and BMI of all children two to 18 years old on an electronic growth chart once a year making the ""red book"", a child's health record, available online publishing information on how much funding is allocated for children and young people's physical and mental health services and how it is spent developing a children and young people's health strategy for England investing more in school nursing and health visiting services organising local child mental health systems so that they are delivered as close as possible to home Prof Russell Viner, report author and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""This report clearly identifies the danger on the horizon - but trends shown here are not inevitable. ""Each of them could be turned around if key actions are undertaken."" He said it was ""hugely encouraging"" that child and maternal health had been highlighted in the NHS England long-term plan, which is published soon. He added the plan was ""a crucial opportunity for improving child health"". ""Act now or the consequences are grave,"" was Prof Viner's message to policy-makers. Alana Ryan, from the NSPCC, said it was unacceptable that so many children were unable to access help mental health support from local services when they needed it most. ""Young people's mental and emotional wellbeing must be a top priority in the new NHS England strategy."" The Royal College of Nursing said the report painted ""a bleak picture for children and young people"". And it said health visitors and school nurses were ""the front-line defence against childhood obesity and poor child mental health"" but all too often they were understaffed. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Improving children's mental and physical health is a key priority for this government and will be pivotal in our long term plan for the NHS, which we're backing with additional funding of an extra Â£20.5 billion a year by 2023/24.""

"Lyn Bryant was described as a lovely, ""very family-orientated"" person who would do anything for anyone by her daughter Lee Taylor New DNA evidence that could help solve the brutal murder of a woman 20 years ago has been uncovered by police. Lyn Bryant, 40, was found dead in the gateway of a field on Cornwall's remote Roseland Peninsula on 20 October 1998. The investigation into her death has been one of the longest-running and largest ever carried out by Devon and Cornwall Police but the identity of her attacker has remained a mystery. But detectives now say they have the DNA of the mother-of-two's killer. Investigators and Mrs Bryant's family hope this evidence - a partial DNA profile recovered from her body and swabs from the scene - which was uncovered in 2016 during a forensic review of the case, will lead to a resolution. Mrs Bryant (left) lived at Ruan High Lanes with her husband Peter and daughter Erin (centre), who was 19 at the time. Her eldest daughter Lee, 21, (right) had left home and recently had her first child, Mrs Bryant's grandson, Keelan ""It means we can use that to eliminate somebody fairly quickly,"" said retired detective inspector and current senior investigating officer Stuart Ellis. ""This type of case is rare in such a quiet, rural location; it has always been a frustration that somebody has been able to get into that rural location, commit such a murder and not be seen or identified by anybody."" Latest news and updates from Cornwall During the original investigation, about 6,000 people had DNA taken. However, these samples were destroyedbecause of a change in legislation in 2013, just three years before new technology allowed scientists to piece together the partial DNA profile Mr Ellis said he was sure belonged to Mrs Bryant's killer. This video can not be played Lyn Bryant's daughter, Lee Taylor, hopes the the new evidence will make a difference He said officers were now going back over the list and retaking samples from some people on it. Mr Ellis said three suspects arrested during the investigation and cleared at least 10 years ago had now also been eliminated forensically. Devon and Cornwall Police have long wanted to trace three unidentified men spotted in the vicinity on the day of Lyn Bryant's murder: The bearded driver of a scruffy white car-derived van who was on the forecourt of Chenoweth's garage at about 13:05 BST, at the same time as Mrs Bryant. A clean-shaven man in his 30s seen talking to Mrs Bryant between 13:45 and 14:00. This was the last known sighting of her. A clean-shaven man wearing ""normal clothes"" who was seen by a farmer walking through a field, away from the murder scene. The farmer said this was very unusual. Detectives have said they believed Mrs Bryant's murder was sexually motivated because of the way her clothes had been disturbed. She had suffered stab wounds to her back, neck and chest and Mr Ellis said Mrs Bryant was in ""contact with her attacker for some period of time"", having been stabbed while she stood up and in a horizontal position. The investigation into Mrs Bryant's death has cost Â£2m Mrs Bryant's daughter, Lee Taylor, was just 21 and a new mother herself when officers came to her house to tell her ""there's been an accident"". Now 41, Mrs Taylor told the BBC her memory of the ""surreal"" following days and weeks was hazy but said the worst part was ""thinking about what her last moments were like, when she was there on her own"". ""I think that's probably the hardest bit that I do try not to think about,"" she added. Mrs Taylor said she believed the killer was ""still out there"", adding: ""You feel like somebody is watching you. ""I have felt like that for a very long time... We are just hoping that maybe there is somebody out there who had suspicions at the time but wasn't able to do anything about it.""

"This video can not be played Some of the most striking images from the Storm Callum floods Communities are surveying the damage as the clean-up continues following the worst flooding for 30 years in parts of Wales. Many rivers burst their banks during Storm Callum, prompting Natural Resources Wales to pledge a review of flood defences. Some people have been left counting the cost from damage in their communities. And roads and rail services remain affected on Monday and there are severalflood warnings in place,external. A 21-year-old manwas killed after a landslipand many homes and businesses were flooded as Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and south Powys bore the brunt of the storm on Friday and over the weekend. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said 80 properties flooded across south west Wales and led to major disruption of businesses and transport across the whole of the country. Operations manager Huwel Manley said action was needed to protect communities from rising water. ""There will be a large review about the flooding issues and flood protection,"" he said. ""There will be a lot of towns and communities calling for new flood defences who at the moment don't have that. ""There is certainly a lot of work for us, the Welsh Government and local authorities to undertake over the coming months."" Man killed in Cwmduad landslide Water recedes as fatal storm passes The most striking Storm Callum pictures NRW added while some communities were significantly affected, flood defences did their job for many. First Minister Carwyn Jones said NRW's review will decide whether ""there needs to be a rejigging of priorities in terms of where the work is done in the future"". He told BBC Radio Wales that money would also be available if necessary. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn said: ""My sympathies go out to all those who have been flooded over this weekend and in particular to the family of the young man who lost his life as a result of a landslide. ""The full impacts of this flooding are still coming in, however we are also hearing reports of where our recent investment has prevented or reduced the impact of flooding."" She added she would make a statement to assembly on Tuesday with the latest update. Surveying the damage... people return to Aberaeron harbour to start the clean-up The River Teifi at Llandysul reached its highest level since records began in 1971 and the Towey above Carmarthen was at its highest since 1987. In Abergwili, in the Tywi Valley, the flood gates were closed and prevented flooding despite the water level rising to within 180mm of the top of the gate, just short of the evacuation trigger of 150mm. Nine boats sank at Aberaeron harbour due to the ""tide and river fighting against each other"", according to local man Stuart Evans. He said Friday's bad weather stopped the boats, some costing thousands of pounds, from being removed. Firefighters were called to Station Road, Llandysul, where about 60 gas cylinders had entered the Tyweli river. Twelve properties were evacuated and 40 cylinders were retrieved. Officers and police monitored the river until the water level dropped and the cordons have now been lifted and people returned to their homes. The river is swollen at Llandysul Meanwhile, Llandysul Paddlers Canoe Club and Outdoor Education Centre has suffered ""extensive damage"" because of flooding in the town. Openreach said a number of properties in Llandysul were without landline and broadband services, and it was working around the clock to repair damaged cables. In the Towy Valley, 93-year-old Dilys Pugh had to be carried from her flooded home at Pontargothi after she woke to find the floodwater around her first floor bed as high as the mattress, according to her son, Clive. About 70 sheep are thought to have died after being ""washed away"" due to flooding at Pontargothi on Saturday, RSPCA Cymru said. About 35 other sheep had survived and were moved to higher ground on Sunday. The River Conwy burst its banks in Llanwrst Dan Yr Ogof dinosaur park in the Brecon Beacons said one of its 250 dinosaur models had been washed away from near the cave entrance, when a ledge it was sitting on collapsed. Staff have spent 48 hours looking for it in nearby rivers but believe it is somewhere between the caves and Swansea. Alun Lenny, county councillor for Camarthen Town South and planning committee chairman, said once-in-100-year storms were happening more frequently and the latest was a ""wake-up call"" that action needed to be taken. Carmarthen was a no-go area on Saturday night as the River Towy reached critical levels after breaching its flood defences, while the River Teifi reached record levels - more than 15ft (4.5m) on Saturday - which flooded towns like Newcastle Emlyn and Lampeter. Carmarthenshire council said it had switched its efforts from emergency response to recovery, and put resources in place to collect ruined carpets, furniture and other waste, with cages and skips dispatched to worst-hit areas. Dehumidifers have been provided to as many homes as possible and a hardship fund has been established for residents most in need of financial support, with officers visiting homes to help people submit insurance claims. The Riverside Cafe at Newcastle Emlyn in Ceredigion was overwhelmed as the River Teifi burst its banks Radhika Kelly, who owns the Riverside cafe in Newcastle Emlyn, said the building had been wrecked by flooding which had damaged equipment and left a trail of mud. ""One minute I'm devastated the next minute I'm feeling positive because there is a great community spirit behind us,"" she said. Fionna Ashman, owner of Lizzie's Barn Dog Sanctuary in Kidwelly, which has been repeatedly flooded, said: ""We are going to have to build the land up around us."" This video can not be played Stranded horses rescued from flood water in Monmouthshire Llechryd Bridge remains closed until a structural survey has been carried out The A4042 between Abergavenny and Pontypool is shut in both directions at Llanellen in Monmouthshire after the River Usk flooded. The A484 between Carmarthen and Cardigan is also blocked in several places - at Cenarth, Llechryd, Cynwyl Elfed and Newcastle Emlyn - after the River Teifi burst its banks. Bus services are replacing trains services between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction and Craven Arms and Llanelli. Flooded fields in Carmarthen on Saturday morning Valley Line services into Cardiff and trains on the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury Cambrian Line are expected to run as usual after the tracks were cleared of floodwater. But buses will replace trains on the Heart of Wales line between Swansea and Shrewsbury until Tuesday due to flooding in the Llandeilo area. This video can not be played Cows wade through flood water near Llandeilo Transport for Wales (TfW), whichtook over running services in Wales from Arriva Trains Waleson Sunday, have warned passengers services could be altered or run at reduced capacity on their first morning commute. TfW said this was because ""several trains have sustained significant damage during this storm due to striking trees and running through flood water"" and passengers are advised tocheck before travelling,external. Coleg Sir Gar in Carmarthenshire said its Gelli Aur campus is closed on Monday, also affecting its open evening, due to flooding in the surrounding area. And the county council said school bus services would also be affected on Monday. Clean-up work has been completed to the boardwalk at Cardiff Bay after the water level rose above 5m, spilling over into Mermaid Quay. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn praised the work of emergency services and others dealing with the floods and the clean-up work. She added: ""Over this government term we will provide over Â£350m investment across Wales to local authorities and Natural Resources Wales to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion."" Welsh Conservatives' environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""As ever, lessons must be learnt from the devastation caused by these terrible floods, and those affected will want meaningful action from the Welsh Government - not just sympathy.""

"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998. Harry, five, on his first day at Wetherby School, Notting Hill Prince Harry watching his brother sign the Eton College entrance book in 1995 - he would follow in his footsteps, joining the school three years later After leaving Eton with two A-levels in 2003, Harry took a gap year. He worked on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho, paving the way for the charity he later set up there. Prince Charles took his sons on annual skiing holidays to Switzerland Attention from the press has been a constant in Harry's life. The front page of a 2002 edition of the (now defunct) News of the World roared: ""Harry's drugs shame"",  and claimed Prince Charles sent his son to visit a rehab clinic as punishment for smoking cannabis. St James's Palace confirmed the then 17-year-old had ""experimented with the drug on several occasions"" but said the use was not ""regular"". Then in October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club. A royal spokesman said at the time the 20-year-old prince was hit in the face by a camera ""when photographers crowded around him"". As part of his gap year, Prince Harry spent time at an orphanage in Lesotho, in southern Africa When Harry pushed the camera away, ""it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut"", the spokesman added. The following year, an image of the prince dressed as a Nazi at a fancy dress party sparked outrage. Clarence House later said the prince had apologised for any ""offence or embarrassment"" caused and had realised ""it was a poor choice of costume"". And in 2009, video footage emerged of Harry using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon. St James's Palace said the prince was ""extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause"" but said he had ""used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon"". Harry enjoyed lighter-hearted press coverage during the London 2012 Olympic Games, in his role as an Olympic ambassador. The prince was an Olympic ambassador at the London 2012 Games In the same year he spent a lot of time in front of the cameras for the Queen's Jubilee. As part of those celebrations Harry completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica. However, that August, photos emerged of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The two photos,published on US gossip website TMZ and later in the Sun newspaper, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing ""strip billiards"". He later said he had ""probably let myself down"" but added: ""I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" There is, however, a saving grace to the scrapes Harry has found himself in. As the younger brother to the expected future king, Harry has relatively little responsibility. Like the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and Prince Charles's younger siblings, Harry is a ""spare to the heir"" - and a world away from the throne. So Harry's indiscretions have done little to dent public opinion of him. And he has perhaps had a freer existence because of it; security worries would have made active service in Afghanistan impossible for his older brother, for example. Harry served a tour in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces, becoming the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone. He was left disappointed in 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of ""unacceptable risks"", but later spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008. Harry returned to the country as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013. He later describedhow he had shot at Taliban insurgents, and said that being in Afghanistan was ""as normal as it's going to get"" for him. The prince said quitting the Army had been a ""really tough decision"" When heannounced he would be leaving the Army in 2015, the prince said his time in the military would ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". This is reflected in his charity work, which mostly concentrates on mental health and helping service veterans. Harry's most notable charity work so far is his founding and chairing of the Invictus Games in 2014. The Paralympic-style international competition for injured ex-service personnel has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney. The prince has been the driving force behind the Invictus Games He has also supported the charity Walking With the Wounded, for injured veterans. The prince's other charity work includes supporting conservation projects in Africa and jointly founding Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho. On his visit to Angola in September, Harry said landmines are ""an unhealed scar of war"" Harry and his brother William have worked together on various charity initiatives He has continued his mother's work helping children affected by HIV and Aids, and supporting the Halo Trust's work in clearing landmines. Diana captured global attention when she walked through a live minefield in central Angola in 1997. She died in Paris later that year, before seeing the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - but Harry highlighted her achievements whenhe retraced her stepsin September 2019. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge supported Heads Together runners at the London Marathon in 2017 In later years, Harry has had counselling to help him deal with his mother's death. He was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011, and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have Diana there. In acandid interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, he described shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother. This, he said, had a ""quite serious effect"" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown ""on numerous occasions"". He also said he would probably regret""for the rest of his life"" how brief his last phone call with his mother was, and spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. She was a ""total kid through and through"", he said. Harry, William and the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces to focus their campaigning efforts on mental health. They founded Heads Together, which aims to tackle stigma and fundraise for new support services. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were first pictured together at the Invictus Games in 2017 As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years. In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actor, Meghan Markle,while issuing a statement,externalaccusing journalists of harassing her. He described ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"", attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. Then after just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. Profile: Duchess of Sussex In September 2017, the year before their wedding, Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine she and Harry were ""two people who are really happy and in love,external"". Andin an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". He designed the engagement ring for Meghan, including two diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection. The couple married in May 2018at a ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and consequently became known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On a 16-day tour of Australia that October, the duke and duchess announced they were expecting their first child, adding that they were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of their news. Baby Archie, described by Harry as ""our own little bundle of joy"", was born on 6 May 2019. Prince Harry said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the birth of his first child, Archie The duke's past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. In 2019, he and his wife split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the subsequent launch of the Sussexes' Instagram account amassed more than one million followers in record-breaking time (five hours and 45 minutes). The joy of becoming parents was followed days later by news Harry had accepted damages and an apology from a paparazzi agency that had used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. In June, the Sussexes announced they would split from the charity they shared with the Cambridges - fuelling speculation of a rift between brothers Harry and William. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" A 10-day tour of Africa at the end of September 2019 started well. Harry raised awareness for causes close to his heart, and the couple introduced Archie to anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But during the tour, the Duchess of Sussex launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The duke and duchess went on a 10-day tour of Africa in September 2019 In a lengthy statement Harry said ""positive"" coverage of the tour of Africa had exposed the ""double standards"" of the ""press pack that has vilified [the duchess] almost daily for the past nine months"". And in an ITV documentary, filmed during the tour and broadcast the following month, the duchess admitted she was struggling to adjust to royal life, while the duke said his mental health was a matter of ""constant management"". Then, at the start of 2020, the couplemade a bombshell announcementthat they would be stepping back as senior royals. Later, Harry would tell host James Corden that the decision to step back was taken to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Their difficult relationship with the UK press saw both Harry and Meghan take legal action against publishers, as well ascutting ties with tabloid newspapers. After a brief stint in Canada, the couple now lives in California and are expecting their second child. The duke has since spoken out on several issues, includingon structural racism,human rightsandunconscious bias. The duke and duchess gave an interview with Oprah, who went to their wedding And the couple have signed deals to make shows and podcasts with Netflix and Spotify. His charity work continues - although he has returned his military appointments and royal patronages. Buckingham Palace said he and Meghan will keep their ""private patronages and associations"". He told interviewer Corden that his ""life is always going to be about public service"". But much of the rest of his future - including how he will continue to carve his own path - remains unclear.

"This video can not be played Some of the most striking images from the Storm Callum floods Communities are surveying the damage as the clean-up continues following the worst flooding for 30 years in parts of Wales. Many rivers burst their banks during Storm Callum, prompting Natural Resources Wales to pledge a review of flood defences. Some people have been left counting the cost from damage in their communities. And roads and rail services remain affected on Monday and there are severalflood warnings in place,external. A 21-year-old manwas killed after a landslipand many homes and businesses were flooded as Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and south Powys bore the brunt of the storm on Friday and over the weekend. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said 80 properties flooded across south west Wales and led to major disruption of businesses and transport across the whole of the country. Operations manager Huwel Manley said action was needed to protect communities from rising water. ""There will be a large review about the flooding issues and flood protection,"" he said. ""There will be a lot of towns and communities calling for new flood defences who at the moment don't have that. ""There is certainly a lot of work for us, the Welsh Government and local authorities to undertake over the coming months."" Man killed in Cwmduad landslide Water recedes as fatal storm passes The most striking Storm Callum pictures NRW added while some communities were significantly affected, flood defences did their job for many. First Minister Carwyn Jones said NRW's review will decide whether ""there needs to be a rejigging of priorities in terms of where the work is done in the future"". He told BBC Radio Wales that money would also be available if necessary. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn said: ""My sympathies go out to all those who have been flooded over this weekend and in particular to the family of the young man who lost his life as a result of a landslide. ""The full impacts of this flooding are still coming in, however we are also hearing reports of where our recent investment has prevented or reduced the impact of flooding."" She added she would make a statement to assembly on Tuesday with the latest update. Surveying the damage... people return to Aberaeron harbour to start the clean-up The River Teifi at Llandysul reached its highest level since records began in 1971 and the Towey above Carmarthen was at its highest since 1987. In Abergwili, in the Tywi Valley, the flood gates were closed and prevented flooding despite the water level rising to within 180mm of the top of the gate, just short of the evacuation trigger of 150mm. Nine boats sank at Aberaeron harbour due to the ""tide and river fighting against each other"", according to local man Stuart Evans. He said Friday's bad weather stopped the boats, some costing thousands of pounds, from being removed. Firefighters were called to Station Road, Llandysul, where about 60 gas cylinders had entered the Tyweli river. Twelve properties were evacuated and 40 cylinders were retrieved. Officers and police monitored the river until the water level dropped and the cordons have now been lifted and people returned to their homes. The river is swollen at Llandysul Meanwhile, Llandysul Paddlers Canoe Club and Outdoor Education Centre has suffered ""extensive damage"" because of flooding in the town. Openreach said a number of properties in Llandysul were without landline and broadband services, and it was working around the clock to repair damaged cables. In the Towy Valley, 93-year-old Dilys Pugh had to be carried from her flooded home at Pontargothi after she woke to find the floodwater around her first floor bed as high as the mattress, according to her son, Clive. About 70 sheep are thought to have died after being ""washed away"" due to flooding at Pontargothi on Saturday, RSPCA Cymru said. About 35 other sheep had survived and were moved to higher ground on Sunday. The River Conwy burst its banks in Llanwrst Dan Yr Ogof dinosaur park in the Brecon Beacons said one of its 250 dinosaur models had been washed away from near the cave entrance, when a ledge it was sitting on collapsed. Staff have spent 48 hours looking for it in nearby rivers but believe it is somewhere between the caves and Swansea. Alun Lenny, county councillor for Camarthen Town South and planning committee chairman, said once-in-100-year storms were happening more frequently and the latest was a ""wake-up call"" that action needed to be taken. Carmarthen was a no-go area on Saturday night as the River Towy reached critical levels after breaching its flood defences, while the River Teifi reached record levels - more than 15ft (4.5m) on Saturday - which flooded towns like Newcastle Emlyn and Lampeter. Carmarthenshire council said it had switched its efforts from emergency response to recovery, and put resources in place to collect ruined carpets, furniture and other waste, with cages and skips dispatched to worst-hit areas. Dehumidifers have been provided to as many homes as possible and a hardship fund has been established for residents most in need of financial support, with officers visiting homes to help people submit insurance claims. The Riverside Cafe at Newcastle Emlyn in Ceredigion was overwhelmed as the River Teifi burst its banks Radhika Kelly, who owns the Riverside cafe in Newcastle Emlyn, said the building had been wrecked by flooding which had damaged equipment and left a trail of mud. ""One minute I'm devastated the next minute I'm feeling positive because there is a great community spirit behind us,"" she said. Fionna Ashman, owner of Lizzie's Barn Dog Sanctuary in Kidwelly, which has been repeatedly flooded, said: ""We are going to have to build the land up around us."" This video can not be played Stranded horses rescued from flood water in Monmouthshire Llechryd Bridge remains closed until a structural survey has been carried out The A4042 between Abergavenny and Pontypool is shut in both directions at Llanellen in Monmouthshire after the River Usk flooded. The A484 between Carmarthen and Cardigan is also blocked in several places - at Cenarth, Llechryd, Cynwyl Elfed and Newcastle Emlyn - after the River Teifi burst its banks. Bus services are replacing trains services between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction and Craven Arms and Llanelli. Flooded fields in Carmarthen on Saturday morning Valley Line services into Cardiff and trains on the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury Cambrian Line are expected to run as usual after the tracks were cleared of floodwater. But buses will replace trains on the Heart of Wales line between Swansea and Shrewsbury until Tuesday due to flooding in the Llandeilo area. This video can not be played Cows wade through flood water near Llandeilo Transport for Wales (TfW), whichtook over running services in Wales from Arriva Trains Waleson Sunday, have warned passengers services could be altered or run at reduced capacity on their first morning commute. TfW said this was because ""several trains have sustained significant damage during this storm due to striking trees and running through flood water"" and passengers are advised tocheck before travelling,external. Coleg Sir Gar in Carmarthenshire said its Gelli Aur campus is closed on Monday, also affecting its open evening, due to flooding in the surrounding area. And the county council said school bus services would also be affected on Monday. Clean-up work has been completed to the boardwalk at Cardiff Bay after the water level rose above 5m, spilling over into Mermaid Quay. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn praised the work of emergency services and others dealing with the floods and the clean-up work. She added: ""Over this government term we will provide over Â£350m investment across Wales to local authorities and Natural Resources Wales to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion."" Welsh Conservatives' environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""As ever, lessons must be learnt from the devastation caused by these terrible floods, and those affected will want meaningful action from the Welsh Government - not just sympathy.""

"The C5 notices contain information about what constitutes a child sex offence Police are giving leaflets to people at risk of committing child sexual exploitation crimes, asking for their behaviour to stop, the BBC has found. The ""C5 notices"" - used by Hampshire Police when there is not enough evidence to charge - explain the law to recipients. They can appear in an enhanced DBS check, which critics say risks penalising innocent people. One Police and Crime Commissioner said it ""won't protect a soul"". The leaflets have been issued by Hampshire Police 54 times since their introduction in November 2016, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. A total of 52 were given to men with 34 handed to people aged 25 and under. The force said the notices were used in cases where officers did not have enough evidence to charge a person with an offence, but were still concerned about their sexual behaviour. One example given was of a woman who was reported to police after 15 and 16-year-old boys were seen in her flat. Sergeant Waghorn has personally handed out three C5 notices Sergeant Antony Waghorn said officers, in delivering the notice to her, were able to educate her on the age of consent, giving them a ""foot in the door... to go and speak to her and have a look around"". The woman has not come to police attention since being issued with the notice. Labour MP Sarah Champion, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Preventing Sexual Violence, said she was in favour of the initiative. ""What I'm hoping is, with Hampshire Police issuing these notices, it stops people in their tracks. ""That it makes them realise what they're doing - or what they're potentially thinking about - is a crime. ""That's the best way to protect children."" A number of other police forces are also considering introducing the forms, the BBC understands. But Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird, the national lead for child sexual abuse cases and a former barrister, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was worried the scheme ""won't protect a soul"" and would actually ""put police off the scent"" during an investigation. ""I don't know of anything else like this at all. There's nothing like a prospect of a conviction with this,"" she said. ""Cuts in budget and a vastly increased demand on policing are likely to have played a part [in its use],"" she added. Aine Kervick fears the notices could have long-term consequences for innocent people Aine Kervick, a criminal defence lawyer at Kingsley Napley, said the notices were ""criminalisation by default"", which risked damaging people's rights. The warning notice could show up in an enhanced DBS check - the type of background search carried out by employers for roles working with children. ""The employer of the future is not going to look behind itâ¦ they're just going to see that you've received a warning notice for child sexual exploitation and have serious concerns about your suitability"", she said. Hampshire Police denied the scheme was a cost-cutting measure, and said a warning notice would only be disclosed during a DBS check if it was relevant to the request.

"The former police chief for Scotland, who resigned amid allegations of bullying, has landed a major new role in policing. Phil Gormley will be named as an inspector of constabulary, overseeing the performance of forces in England and Wales, the BBC understands. He resigned as the chief constable of Police Scotland in February, during a series of investigations into claims of gross misconduct. He has always denied any wrongdoing. His new position is expected to be announced by the Home Office this week and he will start on Monday 22 October. In July 2017, it was revealed that Mr Gormley wasbeing investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner(Pirc) over bullying allegations. He resigned from his role seven months later, saying itwould have been ""impossible"" to resume workingin a ""meaningful"" way, having been on gardening leave for five months. How a glittering police career turned into a soap opera Timeline - the Phil Gormley inquiry Police Scotland chief constable quits At the time, the Pirc in Scotland was investigating five complaints - two others were being assessed internally. They included claims of gross misconduct, which if proven, could have led to Mr Gormley being sacked. The inquiries - whichcaused a political row involving the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) and the then Justice Minister Michael Matheson- were halted after he resigned and no action was taken. Phil Gormley was due to resume his role when Scotland's Justice Secretary Michael Matheson intervened A month before he resigned his wife, Claire, had taken the highly unusual step of writing to a national newspaper to condemn the ""half-truths and lack of transparency"" surrounding the investigation into her husband, which she said had the features of a ""disproportionate fishing expedition"". The appointment of Mr Gormley to the policing watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), may cause surprise in Scotland - but will be seen by his supporters as a vindication of his case. It's understood he was chosen from a strong field of candidates after a rigorous and protracted selection process in which he had to appear before a panel of experts before being interviewed by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Mr Gormley used to work as a commander for the Met Police His job at HMICFRS, working for Sir Tom Winsor, will involve inspecting 12 forces in the north of England, including Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and Merseyside. Mr Gormley, who's in his mid-50s, will be the only inspector of constabulary, out of six, to have worked in policing. During his 33-year career, in which he rose to become Norfolk's chief constable and deputy director of the National Crime Agency, he served as a Metropolitan Police commander with oversight of the Special Demonstration Squad - a shadowy team that infiltrated political protest groups. Some officers from the undercover unit entered into long-term sexual relationships with women they'd targeted but Mr Gormley told BBC Scotland he knew ""nothing at all"" at the time.

"Katya Jones and Seann Walsh danced the Charleston Seann Walsh and Katya Jones are through to the next round of Strictly Come Dancing after a week of controversy. They have faced calls to leave the show after being photographed kissing on the birthday of Walsh's now ex-girlfriend. However, their Charleston received a warm reaction from the crowd who cheered as the pair took on a number of tricky lifts on Saturday night. Katie Piper became the third celebrity to leave the show after losing out to Charles Venn in the dance-off. The TV presenter and her partner Gorka Marquez danced their jive again in the dance-off but the judges chose to save Venn and his partner Karen Clifton after they repeated their salsa. Piper said she felt ""thrilled"" and ""privileged"" to have made it to week four, adding: ""I have taken a lot from this experience and it has all been really positive, and I'll never forget this journey."" Katie Piper's jive with Gorka Marquez saw her in the dance off After the latest elimination, fans were left divided in their reaction on social media, with many saying Walsh deserved to go. One outraged viewer tweeted: ""Cannot believe seann and katya got through, what a great advertisement for cheating!?!"" Another wrote: Allow Twitter content?

Comedian Walsh and professional dancer Jones, who is married, both apologised after the images of them kissing emerged. Walsh, 32, tweeted: ""This is no excuse but it was a one-off drunken mistake which I am truly sorry for."" Venn and Clifton survived the dance-off Jones, 29, said the kiss was a ""one-off mistake after some drinks"". ""I'm so sorry about any offence or hurt I may have caused with my actions,"" the dancer tweeted. ""I love my husband and we are very happy together, this is not a reflection on our relationship."" The publication of the photos in a Sunday newspaper of the pair kissing led Walsh's girlfriend to end their relationship. Actress Rebecca Humphries broke her silence soon after, claiming in an open letter that Walsh had called her ""psycho/nuts/mental"" when she suspected something was going on between him and Jones, who is married to Strictly dancer Neil Jones. Performing on Saturday night for the first time since the photographs emerged, Walsh and Jones were scored 28 by the judges. Seann Walsh with Rebecca Humphries Former Strictly professional James Jordan tweeted that he thought the pair had been ""overmarked"" to protect them from elimination. One viewer suggested the show had failed to address the elephant in the room by not referring to the kiss. Strictly kiss: Katya was 'in the wrong' 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend There has been no direct reference on the show to the furore around Walsh and Jones - apart from an indirect joke from Claudia Winkleman on Saturday night. But judge Craig Revel Horwood told The Jonathan Ross Show: ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the dance of shame, if you like."" More than 10 million viewers tuned in to watch Strictly on Saturday. Peaking at 11.9 million viewers, it had an audience share of 51.2% and was the most-watched show across all channels on Saturday, according to overnight ratings. 14 things we learned from Strictly's stars 'All about the dancing' for Strictly kiss duo Strictly kiss: Katya was 'in the wrong' Seann and Katya 'must do dance of shame' Strictly's Seann speaks out over kiss 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend Has the Strictly curse struck again?

"GPs in England are being given permission to prescribe patients ""social"" activities, such as dance classes, to tackle loneliness. The strategy, announced by Prime Minister Theresa May, will also see postal delivery workers checking in on isolated people during their rounds. The government says about 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in over a month. And many GPs see between one and five people a day suffering with loneliness. As part of the long-term plan, funding will be provided to connect NHS patients in England to a variety of activities, such as cookery classes, walking clubs and art groups, by 2023. Announcing an extra Â£1.8m for community projects, such as creating new community cafes, art spaces or gardens, Mrs May said social prescriptions would reduce demand on the NHS and improve patients' quality of life. The government will also partner with the Royal Mail on a new scheme in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby to give postal workers a front-line role in tackling loneliness. And a network of  businesses - including Sainsbury's, Transport for London, the Co-op, British Red Cross, National Grid and Civil Service - have pledged to take further action to support their employees' health and social wellbeing. Mrs Cox was MP for Batley and Spen from 2015 until her murder the following year Launching the first loneliness strategy, Mrs May said: ""This strategy is only the beginning of delivering a long and far reaching social change in our country - but it is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our lifetimes."" She paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her death: ""Jo Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental wellbeing as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. ""I was pleased to be able to support the Loneliness Commission set up in Jo's name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations."" Kim Leadbeater, Ms Cox's sister, on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: ""The important thing now is to turn the dialogue and strategy into action. ""That is undoubtedly what Jo would want and for every life that is made less lonely as a result of the work she started and that we have all continued, we will take great comfort. ""I look forward to this happening in the coming months and years.""

"The UK is taking a tentative step towards a radical ""green"" future with zero emissions of greenhouse gases. The government is formally seeking Committee on Climate Change guidance about how and when to make this leap. If it happens it would mark an extraordinary transformation of an economy built on burning fossil fuels. The decision was prompted by last week's UN report warning that CO2 emissions must be stopped completely to avoid dangerous climate disruption. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Six climate questions for 'Green GB' Is your Netflix habit bad for the environment? Climate minister Claire Perry told BBC News: ""The report was a really stark and sober piece of work - a good piece of work. ""Now we know what the goal is and we know what some of the levers are. ""But for me, the constant question is what is the cost and who's going to bear that, both in the UK and in the global economy. ""The question is: what does government need to do, where can the private sector come in, and what technologies will come through?"" Ms Perry has declared this week to be Green GB Week, which aims to raise debate in society about how to tackle climate change while also growing the economy. The UK's current target is a reduction of 80% of emissions by 2050 based on 1990 levels. But the CCC, which is an independent body set up to advise the government on emissions targets,  is warning  the UK will drift further away from this goal unless new policies are introduced. Experts say greater emissions cuts are already needed from cars, planes, industry, waste, farming, meat consumption and heating. Emissions from car exhausts are among the gases that need to be stamped out, says the CCC Green groups have derided recent environmentally-damaging policies like expanding Heathrow, promoting fracking, freezing fuel duty, virtually banning onshore wind power, scrapping solar subsidies, and cancelling zero carbon homes. Only last week the government reduced subsidies for electric cars. And the UK's export credit agency - which underwrites risky export deals to boost international trade - announced it is considering finance for an expansion of an oil refinery in Bahrain. The campaign group Global Witness said this made the UK's claim to global climate leadership ""laughable"". And the CCC said progress with electric vehicles was too slow, with too few charging points. Claire Perry has backed the decision to scrap solar feed-in tariffs But Ms Perry defended the government's record. She said: ""I want my next vehicle to be electric"". ""The challenge in Devizes (her constituency) is range anxiety. As part of Green GB week we are urging people to take a test drive in an electric vehicle."" She also backed the UK's decision to scrap solar feed-in tariffs. ""We have spent billions of pounds of taxpayers' money - other people's money - to stimulate the roll-out of solar panels on people's homes,"" she said. ""In my constituency I met a lady who said, 'look at my solar panels'. I said: 'Great - what's happened to your electricity bill?' She said, 'I don't know - but my accountant said I could get 12% a year from installing them'. Surely that's not a good way to spend other people's money?"" She also defended fracking. ""Those who speak so strongly of need to accept scientific evidence of climate change are happy to chuck the scientific evidence of the safety of shale gas exploration in the bin. ""Why would you want to import gas when you could create your own?"" she asked.

"This video can not be played Some of the most striking images from the Storm Callum floods Communities are surveying the damage as the clean-up continues following the worst flooding for 30 years in parts of Wales. Many rivers burst their banks during Storm Callum, prompting Natural Resources Wales to pledge a review of flood defences. Some people have been left counting the cost from damage in their communities. And roads and rail services remain affected on Monday and there are severalflood warnings in place,external. A 21-year-old manwas killed after a landslipand many homes and businesses were flooded as Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and south Powys bore the brunt of the storm on Friday and over the weekend. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said 80 properties flooded across south west Wales and led to major disruption of businesses and transport across the whole of the country. Operations manager Huwel Manley said action was needed to protect communities from rising water. ""There will be a large review about the flooding issues and flood protection,"" he said. ""There will be a lot of towns and communities calling for new flood defences who at the moment don't have that. ""There is certainly a lot of work for us, the Welsh Government and local authorities to undertake over the coming months."" Man killed in Cwmduad landslide Water recedes as fatal storm passes The most striking Storm Callum pictures NRW added while some communities were significantly affected, flood defences did their job for many. First Minister Carwyn Jones said NRW's review will decide whether ""there needs to be a rejigging of priorities in terms of where the work is done in the future"". He told BBC Radio Wales that money would also be available if necessary. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn said: ""My sympathies go out to all those who have been flooded over this weekend and in particular to the family of the young man who lost his life as a result of a landslide. ""The full impacts of this flooding are still coming in, however we are also hearing reports of where our recent investment has prevented or reduced the impact of flooding."" She added she would make a statement to assembly on Tuesday with the latest update. Surveying the damage... people return to Aberaeron harbour to start the clean-up The River Teifi at Llandysul reached its highest level since records began in 1971 and the Towey above Carmarthen was at its highest since 1987. In Abergwili, in the Tywi Valley, the flood gates were closed and prevented flooding despite the water level rising to within 180mm of the top of the gate, just short of the evacuation trigger of 150mm. Nine boats sank at Aberaeron harbour due to the ""tide and river fighting against each other"", according to local man Stuart Evans. He said Friday's bad weather stopped the boats, some costing thousands of pounds, from being removed. Firefighters were called to Station Road, Llandysul, where about 60 gas cylinders had entered the Tyweli river. Twelve properties were evacuated and 40 cylinders were retrieved. Officers and police monitored the river until the water level dropped and the cordons have now been lifted and people returned to their homes. The river is swollen at Llandysul Meanwhile, Llandysul Paddlers Canoe Club and Outdoor Education Centre has suffered ""extensive damage"" because of flooding in the town. Openreach said a number of properties in Llandysul were without landline and broadband services, and it was working around the clock to repair damaged cables. In the Towy Valley, 93-year-old Dilys Pugh had to be carried from her flooded home at Pontargothi after she woke to find the floodwater around her first floor bed as high as the mattress, according to her son, Clive. About 70 sheep are thought to have died after being ""washed away"" due to flooding at Pontargothi on Saturday, RSPCA Cymru said. About 35 other sheep had survived and were moved to higher ground on Sunday. The River Conwy burst its banks in Llanwrst Dan Yr Ogof dinosaur park in the Brecon Beacons said one of its 250 dinosaur models had been washed away from near the cave entrance, when a ledge it was sitting on collapsed. Staff have spent 48 hours looking for it in nearby rivers but believe it is somewhere between the caves and Swansea. Alun Lenny, county councillor for Camarthen Town South and planning committee chairman, said once-in-100-year storms were happening more frequently and the latest was a ""wake-up call"" that action needed to be taken. Carmarthen was a no-go area on Saturday night as the River Towy reached critical levels after breaching its flood defences, while the River Teifi reached record levels - more than 15ft (4.5m) on Saturday - which flooded towns like Newcastle Emlyn and Lampeter. Carmarthenshire council said it had switched its efforts from emergency response to recovery, and put resources in place to collect ruined carpets, furniture and other waste, with cages and skips dispatched to worst-hit areas. Dehumidifers have been provided to as many homes as possible and a hardship fund has been established for residents most in need of financial support, with officers visiting homes to help people submit insurance claims. The Riverside Cafe at Newcastle Emlyn in Ceredigion was overwhelmed as the River Teifi burst its banks Radhika Kelly, who owns the Riverside cafe in Newcastle Emlyn, said the building had been wrecked by flooding which had damaged equipment and left a trail of mud. ""One minute I'm devastated the next minute I'm feeling positive because there is a great community spirit behind us,"" she said. Fionna Ashman, owner of Lizzie's Barn Dog Sanctuary in Kidwelly, which has been repeatedly flooded, said: ""We are going to have to build the land up around us."" This video can not be played Stranded horses rescued from flood water in Monmouthshire Llechryd Bridge remains closed until a structural survey has been carried out The A4042 between Abergavenny and Pontypool is shut in both directions at Llanellen in Monmouthshire after the River Usk flooded. The A484 between Carmarthen and Cardigan is also blocked in several places - at Cenarth, Llechryd, Cynwyl Elfed and Newcastle Emlyn - after the River Teifi burst its banks. Bus services are replacing trains services between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction and Craven Arms and Llanelli. Flooded fields in Carmarthen on Saturday morning Valley Line services into Cardiff and trains on the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury Cambrian Line are expected to run as usual after the tracks were cleared of floodwater. But buses will replace trains on the Heart of Wales line between Swansea and Shrewsbury until Tuesday due to flooding in the Llandeilo area. This video can not be played Cows wade through flood water near Llandeilo Transport for Wales (TfW), whichtook over running services in Wales from Arriva Trains Waleson Sunday, have warned passengers services could be altered or run at reduced capacity on their first morning commute. TfW said this was because ""several trains have sustained significant damage during this storm due to striking trees and running through flood water"" and passengers are advised tocheck before travelling,external. Coleg Sir Gar in Carmarthenshire said its Gelli Aur campus is closed on Monday, also affecting its open evening, due to flooding in the surrounding area. And the county council said school bus services would also be affected on Monday. Clean-up work has been completed to the boardwalk at Cardiff Bay after the water level rose above 5m, spilling over into Mermaid Quay. Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn praised the work of emergency services and others dealing with the floods and the clean-up work. She added: ""Over this government term we will provide over Â£350m investment across Wales to local authorities and Natural Resources Wales to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion."" Welsh Conservatives' environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""As ever, lessons must be learnt from the devastation caused by these terrible floods, and those affected will want meaningful action from the Welsh Government - not just sympathy.""

"This video can not be played The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Australia The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Sydney to begin an official visit to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. It is the couple's first official royal tour since getting married in May. The 16-day trip coincides with the fourth Invictus Games, beginning in Sydney on Saturday, and includes dozens of official events. Prince Harry and Meghan were met by a large media and security presence at the airport on Monday. They were driven to Admiralty House, the Sydney Harbour residence of Governor-General Peter Cosgrove - who is the Queen's representative in Australia. The couple follow in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. However, the couple did make an official overseas visitto Ireland in July. They travelled by motorcade to a residence on Sydney Harbour They will rest before beginning official duties on Tuesday. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the couple to Australia, describing the visit as exciting. ""It's really a visit with the people,"" she told local network Nine on Monday. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent From the outside, Australia may seem poised to become a republic. It is a successful, modern democracy with a strong national identity that has become home to people from across the globe. In reality, the debate over the monarchy here has been deferred to another day and the fascination with the royals remains strong. Princess Eugenie's recent wedding drew more than a million TV viewers, while Prince Harry's marriage in May was watched by four million Australians. These ratings don't equate to never-ending support for having a head of state nearly 16,000km (10,000 miles) away. But they do show that the celebrity appeal of the young royals is very real, and may only be magnified by the couple's time here. In the coming days, Prince Harry and Meghan will visit attractions including the Sydney Opera House, Taronga Zoo and Bondi Beach. They will also take day trips to Melbourne, drought-stricken NSW town Dubbo, and Queensland's Fraser Island. Princess Eugenie's wedding photos released Harry and Meghan thrill Sussex crowds Prince Harry aims to expand Invictus Games They will then spend a few days in Fiji and Tonga, before concluding the trip with four days in New Zealand. Prince Harry and Meghan were guests at Princess Eugenie's wedding on Friday For the duke, the tour marks a return visit to all four countries. The duchess has previously visited New Zealand as a tourist. Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, spent 18 days in Australia and New Zealand on an official tour in April 2014.

"Donald Trump has said he does believe the climate is changing US President Donald Trump has accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"" as he cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. But Mr Trump also said he no longer believed climate change was a hoax. The comments, made during an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, come less than a week after climate scientists issued a final call to halt rising temperatures. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced. Last week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - warnedthe world was heading towards a temperature rise of 3C. Scientists say that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity - which has caused approximately 1C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' 'Climate change moving faster than we are' What could disappear on 'Hothouse Earth' The report said keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". Climate change was just one issue touched on during the wide-ranging interview,external, during which Mr Trump also: Said that ""the day before"" he took office the US had been on the verge of ""going to war with North Korea"" Said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""probably"" involved in assassinations but added, ""I rely on them, it's not in our country"" Said Russia had meddled in the 2016 elections but added, ""I think China meddled also"" Refused to say whether he would reinstate the migrant child separation policy but added ""there have to be consequences"" for entering the US illegally Said he believed he had treated Christine Blasey Ford with ""respect"" aftermocking her testimony in front of thousands at a rally, and that ""had I not made that speech, we would not have won"" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons During Sunday's interview, Mr Trump cast doubt on making any changes, saying the scientists ""have a very big political agenda"". ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference,"" he told journalist Lesley Stahl. ""But I don't know that it's manmade. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't want to be put at a disadvantage."" Mr Trump added that temperatures ""could very well go back"" - although he did not say how. He said climate change was a hoax during his election campaign in 2016 but has generally avoided taking a clear stance on the issue since taking office. However, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. At the time,Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" dealthat would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. It sparked speculation that the former reality television star still believed climate change had been invented. However, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, later said Mr Trump ""believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation"". The report released last week by the IPCC says climate change can only be stopped if the world makes major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7m square miles) for land energy crops. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world If the world fails to act, the researchers warn, there will be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. By Roger Harrabin BBC Environment Analyst President Trump's views on climate change have swung widely - like his comments on many issues. Vanishingly few informed scientists now disagree that humans have been driving recent climate change, and that further heating will create serious risks for the climate. They don't expect the climate will materially cool again in a natural cycle. The president says he doesn't want to spend trillions of dollars and lose millions of jobs by cutting emissions. Of course he doesn't - but all governments feel the same way. Instead, they are trying to reframe the huge investment needed in renewable energy as a money-making enterprise. The UK's Industrial Strategy, for instance, sets out to create jobs in clean industries to replace those lost in dirty factories. And in the US itself,the solar industry is creating far more jobs than the coal sector,external. Does the president know that?

"Kim Chang-ho, who was among those killed, had won awards for his mountaineering efforts The bodies of nine climbers who died when a violent snowstorm destroyed their camp on a Himalayan peak in Nepal have been retrieved. The five South Koreans and four Nepali guides were found scattered across the base camp near Mount Gurja, a 7,193m high peak (23,600ft).

"Harry and Meghan are expecting a baby in the spring The couple are beginning their first royal tour together in Sydney, Australia They are ""delighted to share this happy news"" Katie Wright and Claire Heald Thank you for following our live coverage of the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan are expecting their first child. Keep up to date with all the latest news here:  Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Nothing changes, said the Palace, the tour goes on as
normal. And in a strictly literal sense they are right - none of the 70-odd engagements that were planned will be cancelled. Fiji and Tonga will still be part of the tour, despite the doubts some have
about pregnant travellers visiting because of concerns over the Zika
virus. Medical advice, says the Palace, has been taken. But in another sense, everything has changed. This is now the Duchess' pregnancy tour - every step of the way she will be
greeted with a new level of excitement and with some degree of concern. This was always going to be a high-profile tour - the news about her pregnancy will ratchet up the interest and the crowds. The announcement that Prince Harry was expecting his first child coincided with him arriving in Australia to launch the fourth Invictus Games in Sydney on Friday. He founded the Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen and servicewomen and veterans in 2014. Prince Harry has grown up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military and, most recently, his charity work. Here is an in-depth look at the 34-year-old. This video can not be played Meghan and Harry: Couple's baby due in Spring 2019 The Duchess of Sussex's mother, Doria Ragland, says she is ""very happy about this lovely news"" following the announcement that her daughter is pregnant. She says she ""looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild"". The announcement of another royal baby on the way came as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Sydney ahead of a 16-day tour of Australia and New Zealand. The duchess is due to give birth next spring. She made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018. Here is everything you need to know about the 37-year-old American. Bookmakers are already speculating on what the name of Prince Harry and Meghan's first child will be. Some have Diana leading the way with odds of 16/1, followed by Elizabeth, Phillip and Henry. James and Victoria are also up there. But Theresa and Donald are lagging, with some putting those topical choices at 150/1. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby will be seventh in line to the throne - moving Prince Harry's uncle, the Duke of York, down into eighth
place. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of
Wessex - the Queen's youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time. See the Royal Family tree and line of successionhere. The couple are there for a royal tour Allow Twitter content?

"Brexit negotiations have hit a ""real problem"" over the issue of the Irish border, government sources have warned. Hopes of a breakthrough were raised when the Brexit secretary made an unscheduled trip to Brussels on Sunday. But talks faltered over the need for a back-up plan - known as the backstop - to avoid a hard border. Theresa May, who is briefing MPs, has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea. Ahead of a key summit of European leaders on Wednesday, the EU is believed to be seeking further reassurances that its internal market will be protected and that additional customs and regulatory checks can be carried out without the return of physical infrastructure on the border. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit and the 'battle for the union' Sunday's talks had broken down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland - if the UK's version wasn't ready in time, Downing Street sources indicated.

The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And the party's Brexit spokesmanhas said,externalthe prospect of a no-deal Brexit is ""probably inevitable"". Ireland's Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, suggested a deal would not be done at this week's summit, which starts on Wednesday. Mr Coveney said he was  ""frustrated and disappointed"" that it was going to take ""more time than people had hoped"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, has set out her alternative Brexit plans, saying it is ""time to compromise"". The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, along with its single market and customs union, which allow for friction-free trade between members. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Monday's papers: 'Brexit impasse' and a 'tussle in Brussels' Sturgeon: 'Time to compromise' on Brexit After Brexit, it will have a land border with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland - but cannot agree how. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? So, the backstop is a position of last resort - to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations. The two sides do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Mrs May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border in the Irish Sea. She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This week's summit comes as domestic political pressure on Mrs May increasesamid threats of potential cabinet resignations. Some Brexiteers are unhappy at the idea of the UK staying aligned to EU rules without a time limit being specified. At the weekend, former Brexit Secretary David Davis urged ministers to ""exert their collective authority"" and rebel against the plans. Allow Twitter content?

We're entering the final stages of these negotiations and we're all behind the PM trying to get the best result,"" she added. Arriving at an EU meeting in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Brexit talks had entered a ""difficult period"", adding: ""Whether a deal is done this week or not who knows?"" He insisted it was possible to do a deal and ""with goodwill on all sides we can get there"".

Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be a chronic miscalculation and an utter disgrace if the policy of the British government was to be set by the most extreme elements of the Brexiteers and the needs and desires and the idiosyncrasies of the Democratic Unionist Party."" Labour, meanwhile, has called on the government to publish its plan for the backstop. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said any proposal needed full scrutiny from MPs before an agreement could be struck with the rest of the EU at the Brussels summit.

"Hundreds of Royal Mail staff have complained that they have been short-changed as a result of a dramatic fall in the company's share price. They claim the privatised company deliberately issued a profit warning weeks before many were planning to sell their shares. Since the announcement on 1 October the shares have fallen by 28%. However Royal Mail said it had no choice but to tell the City as soon as it realised profits would be lower. Some 145,000 postal staff have waited five years to sell the free shares they were given at the time of privatisation. Royal Mail shares plunge on profit warning Monday is the first day they can sell their holdings without having to pay tax or National Insurance. The shares have fallen by 45% since they peaked at 632p in May this year, with some staff seeing the value of their holdings slipping by more than Â£2,500. The shares are now just 13p above the original flotation price of 330p. Des Arthur, a postman from Coventry, was one of those who complained about the company's announcement to the City. ""The timing of it could be viewed as extremely cynical,"" he told the BBC. ""It's going to look like it's not right."" The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said hundreds more staff had expressed their anger. ""Our members certainly believe it's just been done to deflate what they would get if they sold their shares,"" said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU. ""You know what people are like; people in some ways have already spent that money in anticipation."" Royal Mail said it understood the disappointment felt by its staff, but said it had no choice over when to release the profit warning. ""We had an obligation to tell the market, and that's what we did,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""There's no link between that and the free shares."" However the company said anyone who pre-elected to sell their shares before 1 October would be able to cancel their transactions. Other employees said they were happy just to have been given free shares in the first place. ""I'm not annoyed,"" said Adam Alarakhia, a postman from Leicester, whose holding is now worth around Â£2,700. ""The price will shoot up again in our busy period."" Most brokers have Royal Mail shares down as a ""sell"" - in other words they expect the shares to fall further. Berenberg has a target price of Â£3. But the further they fall, the higher the percentage yield. At the moment the annual dividend is a healthy 7%. Indeed so far employees who took their full allocation will have earned Â£850, Royal Mail said, making up for some of their theoretical (on-paper) losses. ""Management have recently reconfirmed their commitment to growing the dividend over time, but with investment demands likely to rise, we find it difficult to see how far that can go,"" said Nicholas Hyett of Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nonetheless, for income seeking investors Royal Mail could well be attractive."" The original privatisation of Royal Mail was criticised by theNational Audit Office,external, which said that taxpayers had lost Â£1bn, because the flotation price was set too low.

"Marc Sutton was shot as he rode his mountain bike in the Alps A British mountain biker has been shot by a hunter in the French Alps. The 34-year-old, named locally as Marc Sutton, was killed by a stray bullet while riding in woodland near Montriond, close to the Swiss border. He was biking on a popular mountain track when he was shot by a 22-year-old who was taken to hospital in severe shock. Originally from Caerphilly, south Wales, he owned a restaurant in the small town of Les Gets. The Foreign Office said it was in touch with local authorities and was providing support to his family. The 34-year-old had recently opened his own restaurant in the area Mr Sutton, a keen snowboarder and mountain biker, ran a private catering business in the area and opened his own restaurant, Wild Beets Kitchen, earlier this year. In a Facebook post, he said of the restaurant: ""I still can't believe that this is ours! Hard work does pay off and dreams do come true."" Philippe Toccanier, prosecutor for the Thonon-Les-Bains region, told the Associated Press (AP) the death in thick woods was believed to be an accident. But he said that Mr Sutton ""couldn't be confused with game, as he had a coloured helmet and a coloured mountain bike"". In the past three years, more than 20 people have died in hunting accidents in France. On a local Facebook group people expressed horror and discussed how to prevent further incidents. ""This has to be stopped. Ban the chasse immediately,"" one said, using the French term for hunting. ""There are no excuses. People's lives are shattered."" But others said hunting was a ""lifelong tradition"" and called for safety measures such as restricting hunting to certain days. An inquiry has been launched into the incident of ""aggravated manslaughter,"" French prosecutors said.

"Katya Jones and Seann Walsh danced the Charleston Seann Walsh and Katya Jones are through to the next round of Strictly Come Dancing after a week of controversy. They have faced calls to leave the show after being photographed kissing on the birthday of Walsh's now ex-girlfriend. However, their Charleston received a warm reaction from the crowd who cheered as the pair took on a number of tricky lifts on Saturday night. Katie Piper became the third celebrity to leave the show after losing out to Charles Venn in the dance-off. The TV presenter and her partner Gorka Marquez danced their jive again in the dance-off but the judges chose to save Venn and his partner Karen Clifton after they repeated their salsa. Piper said she felt ""thrilled"" and ""privileged"" to have made it to week four, adding: ""I have taken a lot from this experience and it has all been really positive, and I'll never forget this journey."" Katie Piper's jive with Gorka Marquez saw her in the dance off After the latest elimination, fans were left divided in their reaction on social media, with many saying Walsh deserved to go.

Comedian Walsh and professional dancer Jones, who is married, both apologised after the images of them kissing emerged. Walsh, 32, tweeted: ""This is no excuse but it was a one-off drunken mistake which I am truly sorry for."" Venn and Clifton survived the dance-off Jones, 29, said the kiss was a ""one-off mistake after some drinks"". ""I'm so sorry about any offence or hurt I may have caused with my actions,"" the dancer tweeted. ""I love my husband and we are very happy together, this is not a reflection on our relationship."" The publication of the photos in a Sunday newspaper of the pair kissing led Walsh's girlfriend to end their relationship. Actress Rebecca Humphries broke her silence soon after, claiming in an open letter that Walsh had called her ""psycho/nuts/mental"" when she suspected something was going on between him and Jones, who is married to Strictly dancer Neil Jones. Performing on Saturday night for the first time since the photographs emerged, Walsh and Jones were scored 28 by the judges. Seann Walsh with Rebecca Humphries Former Strictly professional James Jordan tweeted that he thought the pair had been ""overmarked"" to protect them from elimination. One viewer suggested the show had failed to address the elephant in the room by not referring to the kiss. Strictly kiss: Katya was 'in the wrong' 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend There has been no direct reference on the show to the furore around Walsh and Jones - apart from an indirect joke from Claudia Winkleman on Saturday night. But judge Craig Revel Horwood told The Jonathan Ross Show: ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the dance of shame, if you like.""

"The UK and EU say key issues remain unresolved following unscheduled Brexit talks in Brussels. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier met for more than an hour ahead of a crunch EU leaders' summit this week. Mr Barnier tweeted that issues, such as how to avoid a hard border with Ireland, were ""still open"". A UK government spokesman said UK and EU negotiators ""have made real progress in a number of key areas"". ""However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop,"" he added.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said talks had ""made progress"" in the last few days - and dismissed reports of a row between Mr Raab and Mr Barnier - but added it was ""clear the two sides are stuck"" on how the Irish backstop might work. No further talks are planned before Mr Barnier and Theresa May's summit on Wednesday, she added. The meeting comes as domestic political pressure on Mrs May increases amid threats of potential cabinet resignations. Top Tories 'could resign over Brexit deal' Brexit: All you need to know In a letter to the prime minister, Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson said they would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK in any Brexit deal. It follows reports that other top ministers have been considering their positions over the weekend ahead of a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday at which ministers could be asked to give their consent to any agreement. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg While there may have been a sense in Brussels that Mrs May was moving towards them, if anything the politics at home have become more fraught. Thursday's cabinet meeting ramped up concerns and gave Brexiteers another excuse to rattle their sabres. The DUP continues its warnings that it'd sink the administration rather than see the deal it fears done. Several cabinet ministers are thinking about whether they can go on. And, more to the point, different groups of Tory MPs with gripes about other policies are scenting opportunity as the government is so vulnerable. Any move for the PM has become both harder, and more urgent. Her party won't accept a proposal to keep the UK essentially in the customs union. Parliament is likely to block no deal. The EU won't accept her Chequers plan. Even loyal ministers are deeply worried - ""She is like a chess player who only has the king left - all she can do is move one square at a time until she is check-mated."" Read more from Laura. The Raab-Barnier meeting came amid conflicting signals as to whether the two sides were nearing a deal on the terms of the UK's exit next March. Diplomats from the remaining 27 EU member states were summoned for an update on the process at 17.30 BST, prompting feverish speculation that a deal had been done. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke to Andrew Marr about Brexit negotiations The EU's aim is to have the entire Withdrawal Agreement agreed in principle in time for Wednesday's summit of EU leaders in Brussels. If the EU's 27 - as they are known - agree on it, then work will begin on drafting the political declaration on the future relationship. EU leaders are likely to call another summit in mid-November, at which the withdrawal deal and the framework of future co-operation could be finally approved. The deal would then have to be approved by the UK and EU Parliaments. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that while Mr Raab's visit had an air of drama, it was standard practice in the talks for civil servants to hand over to politicians at key points like this. Rather than a ""victory lap"" by Mr Raab, he said the UK's statement that ""face-to-face talks were necessary to resolve several big issues"" should be taken at face value, and Northern Ireland remained a ""sticking point"". The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will become the UK's border with the EU, is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a divorce deal with Brussels. DUP leader: 'No-deal Brexit most likely' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Wrangling is continuing over the nature of a ""backstop"" to keep the border open if a wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it. The EU's version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels' rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and her Democratic Unionist allies. At the beginning of the summer the government's senior ministers held a day-long meeting about Brexit at Chequers, the prime minister's official country home in Buckinghamshire. The aim was to agree what the government wanted from negotiations with the EU about the future relationship between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The plan that emerged from the meeting has become known as the Chequers plan, or sometimes simply Chequers. The key aim of the plan is to create a free-trade area for goods moving between the EU and the UK while stopping freedom of movement for people between them. To do this, the UK would commit to collecting import taxes, known as tariffs, on behalf of the EU for goods that arrive in the UK on their way to the EU. Meanwhile, goods that were staying in the UK could be charged at a different rate, depending on any future trade deals the UK agrees with other countries. The UK would also agree to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for manufactured goods and food, which would mean following EU rules and standards. In the future, if the EU changed any of its standards, the UK could decide not to follow those changes but at the risk of losing the free trade agreement for those goods. The government believes the combination of the common rulebook and collecting tariffs for the EU would avoid the need for checks on goods passing between the UK and the EU, including over the Â Irish border. However, the EU doesn't accept all proposals in the Chequers plan. It thinks the proposals amount to ""cherry-picking"" parts of EU membership - in other words, keeping the bits the UK wants to stay attached to, while rejecting other rules. The EU is also unconvinced the UK would be able to accurately track all the goods moving through it. And many Conservative MPs are unhappy with the UK government's proposed alternative, which would see the UK temporarily remain in a customs union until the Irish border question is resolved, either through technological solutions or as part of a wider trade agreement. Brexiteers fear this will leave the UK in indefinite limbo, bound by the EU's rules and limited in the trade deals it can negotiate with other countries. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalformer Brexit Secretary David Davis urged ministers to ""exert their collective authority"" and reject the plans at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has been hosting other European foreign ministers at his Chevening residence, said such calls were ""wrong"" when ""last-minute"" talks were going on and Mrs May was ""battling for Britain"". ""The reason that's wrong is there is no-one who is going to be able to negotiate the right deal for Britain better than Theresa May. This is the time to stand rock solid behind Theresa May.""

In their letter to the PM, Mr Mundell and Ms Davidson indicated they would not tolerate a situation in which Northern Ireland remained in the customs union and single market, while the rest of the UK was outside it. They said the integrity of the UK ""remains the single most important issue for us"" and cannot be undermined by any withdrawal agreement with the EU. A source close to Ms Davidson said the issue was a ""red line"" for her, while a source close to Mr Mundell told the BBC: ""If you find yourself not agreeing with government policy"" resigning would be the ""logical outcome"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr show, insisted there were ""different ways"" to ensure any customs commitments were ""credibly time-limited"".

"The CSU appears to have lost support to both right and left Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative sister party has suffered huge losses in Bavaria's state election, raising new doubts about her ruling coalition. The centre-right Christian Social Union (CSU) is set to lose its absolute majority in the state parliament, which it has dominated since 1957. The Greens surged into second place, with nearly 17.5%. The anti-immigration AfD is set to enter Bavaria's parliament for the first time, with most votes counted. The CSU got just over 37% - that is, more than 10% down on its 2013 result. It was also a bitter night for Germany's decades-old centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who slumped to just 9.7%. They and the CSU are in a fragile coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU). Bavaria result: Merkel's three challenges The CSU appears to have suffered from the row over immigration policy earlier this year between Mrs Merkel and Horst Seehofer, the CSU leader and German interior minister. He said it was ""not a nice day"" but added it was only ""one side of the coin"" as the vote gives ""a clear mandate"" allowing the CSU to form a new government. Many voters who disliked the tone of the migration debate may have turned to the Greens There are signs that the CSU is leaning towards forming a Bavarian coalition with the right-leaning Free Voters (FW), a new independent party that won 11.6%. That would be a closer alignment than governing with the Greens. Bavaria orders crosses in state buildings Germany's far right march en masse Alternative for Germany (AfD) came fourth with about 10%. It means AfD will have seats in 15 of Germany's 16 state parliaments. German commentators say the parties in Mrs Merkel's coalition will strive to avoid any further splits ahead of another big state election - in Hesse on 28 October, currently run by the CDU. SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's poor performance in Bavaria on squabbling within the coalition. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Bavaria It was a terrible night for Angela Merkel's Bavarian sister party. The CSU has reigned supreme for decades in what is conservative country. But recent attempts to harden its tone and policies on migration, which included picking high-profile fights with Mrs Merkel, appear to have backfired. It's bad news for Mrs Merkel too. Bavaria reflects what's happening at national level, the dwindling popularity of the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties. Much may now depend on the results in Hesse in a fortnight. The CDU is also losing support. Its general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said that what had happened in Bavaria was a warning. Nearly 13 million residents and the biggest by area of Germany's 16 federal states Its capital Munich is Germany's third-largest city, after Berlin and Hamburg Second-highest GDP out of 16 German states Historically conservative region, with strong Catholic and local traditions Industrial powerhouse: car and IT sectors especially strong, rich in family-run firms AfD's success in Bavaria has not been as great as in eastern Germany but it appears to have taken large numbers of votes from the CSU. But by echoing some of the AfD's hardline policies such as on migration, the CSU also seems to have lost the support of more moderate voters. The CSU's Markus SÃ¶der, current Bavarian prime minister, said the projected result was painful but the party should learn from it. ""We have to analyse the changes taking place both in Bavaria and in society,"" he said. ""One of the most important jobs we now have is to ensure that this state is stable, governable, and remains as strong as it is now."" Some German commentators say the CSU now has an old-fashioned image for many voters. The BBC's Jenny Hill in Bavaria says the election illustrates the complexity of the challenge faced by so many of Europe's large established parties. It's not simply the rise of the far right, she says, but that voters are walking away in favour of smaller, newer movements.

"A sunrise hike of Mount Mansfield, Vermont was on Finn's bucket list When Finn was diagnosed with cancer in May, Cynthia wanted to make sure his last weeks were his best. She and her husband Robert Peterson made a bucket list for six-year-old Finn and those final adventures have beenshared with dog lovers everywhere on Instagram,external. Finn, who lives in Burlington, Vermont has been on a hot air balloon ride, eaten a steak dinner, been apple picking, swum in the ocean, and there is yet more planned. ""We've turned a devastating experience into an empowering one. We've made friends with people globally whose dogs also have cancer,"" Cynthia, 29, told the BBC. Finn, with Cynthia Peterson, 29 and her husband Robert, 33, in Vermont Cynthia, an intensive care nurse, found Finn on an internet forum in 2012 when he was just six weeks old and she says he supported her throughout her 20s. ""He helped me through the grief when my dad died and now he's dying of cancer, too. ""It's a hard blow but really powerful to look back at how he got me through those times and now I'm going to help him,"" she explained. The idea for Finn's bucket list came from a care package they received from Live Like Roo Foundation, an organisation that supports families whose pet has cancer. Finn went on a tethered hot air balloon ride in August The list focuses on activities he would enjoy, like hiking, but they also visited a fire station, made homemade dog treats, and he made a new friend. Finn hasn't responded well to chemotherapy to treat the T-cell lymphoma, and he has just six to eight weeks left. As well as writing a song about Finn, Cynthia plans to write a children's book in his memory. ""He's a very enthusiastic, loyal dog who really lights up at anyone. He would have been an amazing therapy dog."" Finn visited a fire station with Cynthia and Robert's other dog Yogi Connecting with other dog owners using the hashtag #CanineCancerWarrior is helping them feel less isolated. ""There are thousands of posts. It's really beautiful. There are 40 or 50 dogs in one group with their stories shared."" Cynthia also hopes that using social media to document Finn's last weeks will raise awareness of canine cancer and how it affects many families globally. The bucket list is helping them pre-grieve for their pet. ""We know he's dying, but we are trying to make him happy. ""We will look back on this and think we made his final days the best we could. We're making the most of what we've got,"" she adds.

"'Always be alert in your surroundings, so don't use earphones or handheld devices' police advised women Women have been urged not to wear headphones or use mobile phones following a string of sexual assaults in north-west London. Is this a form of victim blaming or necessary advice in an imperfect world? There have been 10 sex attacks on lone women in Cricklewood since February. Policerevealed more details about the assaults on Tuesday, including the attacker's modus operandi. In most cases, which have taken place near Willesden Green Tube station, the man approached a lone woman, tried to chat to her, asked for a kiss or a hug and then sexually abused her. The Metropolitan Police arrested a man and later released him under investigation. But their safety advice to women provoked criticism. ""I would appeal to women in the local area to take care when they are walking, especially if they are alone,"" said Det Con Laura Avery. ""Always stick to well-lit streets. If possible, let someone know when you are coming home and the route you are taking and always be alert in your surroundings, so don't use earphones or handheld devices."" Practical, universal safety tips? Or an unfair onus on women to change their day-to-day, law-abiding, behaviour? Jessica Eaton said it was time to ""stop this victim blaming"" Jessica Eaton, who campaigns on behalf of the victims of sexual violence, called the advice ""ridiculous"" and ""useless"". ""No-one will talk about the most common denominator here,"" she said. ""Headphones don't rape women, nor do skirts, or dark streets, or clubs, or alcohol, or parties, or sleepovers, or school uniforms. ""Name the perpetrators. Name the problem. We can't help if we can't even name it."" She added there was a hypocrisy to the police's sexual assault message and that given out following other types of crime. ""When there is a terrorist attack, government, police and public figures say 'we will not change our way of life, we will not change our behaviours... we will carry on as normal because we deserve a safe society'. ""But when women are being raped and assaulted, government, police and public figures say 'women, change your behaviours... do something different'.  Why are women supposed to change their lives and their behaviours for sex offenders?"" Her sentiments were mirrored online in response to the BBC's story. Allow Twitter content?

""While I'm sure the advice is well intended, it's very problematic,"" she added. ""The narrative puts the victim at fault, rather than the criminal. We so frequently hear reports of attacks which detail the behaviour of the victim: what they were wearing, where they were, what time of day, if they were alone, if they had consumed alcohol. ""All of these things suggest that those choices were naive, foolish, dangerous, or incorrect in some way."" She added that such advice ""creates a culture of fear - and not just for women"". ""It means people fear going out alone in the dark, or wearing outfits society might deem 'provocative', or enjoying a drink on a night out,"" she said. ""I'm a grown woman, I shouldn't need a chaperone. Advice such as this polices the behaviour of innocent people, rather than the actions of criminals."" Siobhan Tatum, a legal professional, tweeted that women often wore headphones precisely to deter male attention. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Damien Hammond, 29, is widely recognised around Nottingham for donning make-up and costumes modelled on the Joker A self-styled Joker lookalike who aped the comic book villain's appearance to ""induce fear into members of the public and retail staff"" has been jailed. Damien Hammond, 29, is widely recognised around Nottingham for donning make-up and costumes modelled on Batman's arch-nemesis. He admitted a series of offences, described as a ""crime wave"" by police, committed over a three-month period. As he was led from the dock, he shouted ""I will kill today"". Appearing at Nottingham Magistrates' Court with bright green hair, Hammond, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to criminal damage and obstructing a police officer. He was jailed after admitting eight offences, including disorderly conduct towards staff in branches of Tesco Express and Shoe Zone. He also admitted disorderly conduct for waving a gun-shaped cigarette lighter while standing among traffic. Hammond had been calm throughout the hearing, even giving a thumbs-up when his make-up was described as representing the Jack Nicholson version of Batman's nemesis. Hammond modelled his make-up on Jack Nicholson and appeared in court with green hair But he reacted with anger when presiding magistrate Dr Janet Ellis told him he was to receive an 11-week sentence. He shouted from the dock: ""Send me to prison, I don't care."" He then vowed to stab prison officers and fellow inmates once his jail sentence began. ""See what you have done, I will kill today!"" he added. Jeff Surgay, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The defendant's criminal conduct involving intimidating retail staff and disorderly conduct towards police officers, in one case striking an officer to the forehead whilst obstructing a drugs search, has been conducted over a prolonged period of time. ""That, together with him altering his appearance to resemble 'The Joker' appears to be calculated to induce fear into members of the public and retail staff in the city centre."" Hammond was told he must also serve an 18-week sentence which had previously been suspended, and made the subject of a three-year behaviour order banning him from areas of central Nottingham.
