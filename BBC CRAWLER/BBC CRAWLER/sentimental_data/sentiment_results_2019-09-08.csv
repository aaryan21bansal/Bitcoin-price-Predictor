"This video can not be played 'BA and pilots are both to blame' British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. The pilots' union Balpa said BA management's cost-cuts and ""dumbing down"" of the brand had eroded confidence in the airline. But BA chief Alex Cruz said investment in the operator had never been so big. The walkout is due to end at midnight on Tuesday, although there could be additional unexpected cancellations on Wednesday. Both sides say they are willing to hold further talks, but no date has been set. The pilots are currently scheduled to stage another strike on 27 September. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute."" But he told the BBC that while BA says publicly it is willing to talk, ""in private they say they are not going to negotiate"". And although the headline dispute is about pay, he said there was also deep resentment about the airline's direction. ""BA has lost the trust and confidence of pilots because of cost-cutting and the dumbing down of the brand... management want to squeeze every last penny out of customers and staff,"" Mr Strutton said. BA's Terminal 5 was deserted on Monday morning Mr Cruz defended the airline against Mr Strutton's claim, saying it had never in its history embarked on such a big investment programme in services and training. He said the airline was ""ready and willing"" to return to talks with Balpa. It is the first time BA pilots have walked out and the action could cost the airline up to Â£40m a day. Some 4,000 pilots are involved in the strike. In a statement, BA said: ""We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa's strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. ""Unfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights."" By Katie Prescott, Business reporter It's unlikely that passengers will see that much disruption at airports. Most of the real problems have happened over the past few weeks as people have rushed to make other travel arrangements, re-book their flights or apply for refunds. In terms of the negotiations, both sides say that they are open to talks but neither has responded to the other, underlining just how acrimonious their relationship has become. Ostensibly this is about pay, but there's also underlying discontent among pilots with the company's strategy. Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits. But industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. They also say airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run and are in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air. BA, however, contend that the company has been recycling profits into new investment in the airline. The company says it is spending Â£6.5bn on new aircraft, new cabins and WiFi on planes. If the two sides don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then. Pilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? No 10 tells BA and pilots to 'sort out' strike Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos BA says its pilots already receive ""world-class"" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is ""fair and generous"", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too. The airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 a year, allowances included. Two weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights due to the planned industrial action. Unfortunately, due to ""human error"" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwingBA's customer service operations into a tailspinover the bank holiday weekend. On Friday, BA said the ""vast majority"" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines.

"Tom Hanks spoke to reporters at the Toronto Film Festival Tom Hanks has said the increasing level of cynicism in society is partly what led him to take a role as a loveable children's entertainer. The actor plays Fred Rogers in his new movie - a legendary US kids TV host whose brand was wholesome and warm. ""Cynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse,"" Hanks told reporters. ""Why? Because it's easy, and there's good money to be made."" He added: ""Cynicism is a great product to sell, and it's the perfect beginning of any examination of anything. And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you. Children's entertainer Fred Rogers died in 2003 ""But I think when Fred Rogers first saw children's programming, he saw something that was cynical, and why would you put something that is cynical in front of a two or three-year-old kid? That you are not cool because you don't have this toy? That it's funny to see someone being bopped on the head? ""That's a cynical treatment of the audience, and we have become so inured to that, that when we are met with as simple a message as 'Hey you know what, it's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood!' we get slapped a little bit. We are allowed, I think, to feel good. There's a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?"" A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood serves as the title of the Rogers film, which is directed by Marielle Heller - well known for the Oscar-nominated Can You Ever Forgive Me? Heller has explained that, because Mr Rogers (as he was known) had such little conflict in his life, he was not an obvious protagonist for a movie, and his career alone wouldn't have served as a strong enough storyline. Tom Hanks plays the gentle and softly-spoken TV host, who was usually seen in zip-up sweaters Instead, A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood follows the relationship between Mr Rogers and a journalist for Esquire magazine,who wrote a profile of the entertainer in 1998,external. The journalist who wrote the original piece, Tom Junod, possessed by trade just the kind of cynical personality Hanks refers to. But when he met Mr Rogers, he found a more complex character than he was expecting. Over a series of sittings, he and Mr Rogers developed a friendship. The entertainer won Junod over with his seemingly unrelenting kindness and empathy, helping him examine his own issues and find a deeper appreciation for life. lt is, frankly, an outstanding film - one of the best seen so far at the Toronto Film Festival and undoubtedly an awards season contender. ""Marielle Heller excels at pulling heartstrings from sturdy foundations, injecting smart and insightful details into material that could easily default to sentimentality,""wrote Eric Kohn in IndieWire,external. This video can not be played Tom Hanks leads his fans in a sing-along of his movie's theme song at the Toronto Film Festival ""Hanks isn't just good - he's transporting,""added Variety's Owen Gleiberman,external. ""He takes on Mr Rogers' legendary mannerisms and owns them, using them as a conduit to Rogers' disarming inner spirit. He makes you believe in this too-nice-for-words man... [the film] is a soft-hearted fable that works on you in an enchanting way."" The Hollywood Reporter was more sceptical,external: ""It is a sympathetic and yet entirely predictable in its dramatic trajectory of making a believer of an angry, cynical journalist. Still, the lure of the Hanks/Rogers match-up looks to stir some reasonable commercial returns."" More from Toronto: Hollywood star's 'battle' to learn Wolverhampton accent Pole dancing in film role 'hardest thing' for Jennifer Lopez Black Panther star's latest role 'a huge responsibility' The script for A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood had been floating around Hollywood for some time before production began. Hanks even passed on the role several times - but then ended up saying yes once director Marielle Heller became attached to the project. The pair had been looking to work on a film together for some time and Hanks said he felt she was the right person to deliver it to the screen. Matthew Rhys, who plays the journalist, said the film taps into a vulnerability which men in particular often keep hidden under the surface. ""Marielle talked about giving men in general a greater emotional vocabulary, or working towards articulating their emotions, and not just generally men, I think society in general would benefit from it,"" he said. Matthew Rhys (right) plays a sceptical journalist who is eventually won over my Mr Rogers' kindness ""And I think it was instantly relatable that someone was so desperately wanting to be seen, but hiding behind this castle that he built for himself, and I think it's a message of hope."" Mr Rogers, who died in 2003, isn't well known in many international territories, however, in the same way he is in the US. Therefore, while a Tom Hanks movie can generally be expected to draw the public to the cinema, the distributors may have a struggle on their hands to market it in some international territories. But by the time it reaches UK cinemas, the awards season buzz it is generating may well be enough to carry it to significant box office success. Tom Hanks leads sing-along with fans.

"This video can not be played 'BA and pilots are both to blame' British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. The pilots' union Balpa said BA management's cost-cuts and ""dumbing down"" of the brand had eroded confidence in the airline. But BA chief Alex Cruz said investment in the operator had never been so big. The walkout is due to end at midnight on Tuesday, although there could be additional unexpected cancellations on Wednesday. Both sides say they are willing to hold further talks, but no date has been set. The pilots are currently scheduled to stage another strike on 27 September. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute."" But he told the BBC that while BA says publicly it is willing to talk, ""in private they say they are not going to negotiate"". And although the headline dispute is about pay, he said there was also deep resentment about the airline's direction. ""BA has lost the trust and confidence of pilots because of cost-cutting and the dumbing down of the brand... management want to squeeze every last penny out of customers and staff,"" Mr Strutton said. BA's Terminal 5 was deserted on Monday morning Mr Cruz defended the airline against Mr Strutton's claim, saying it had never in its history embarked on such a big investment programme in services and training. He said the airline was ""ready and willing"" to return to talks with Balpa. It is the first time BA pilots have walked out and the action could cost the airline up to Â£40m a day. Some 4,000 pilots are involved in the strike. In a statement, BA said: ""We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa's strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. ""Unfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights."" By Katie Prescott, Business reporter It's unlikely that passengers will see that much disruption at airports. Most of the real problems have happened over the past few weeks as people have rushed to make other travel arrangements, re-book their flights or apply for refunds. In terms of the negotiations, both sides say that they are open to talks but neither has responded to the other, underlining just how acrimonious their relationship has become. Ostensibly this is about pay, but there's also underlying discontent among pilots with the company's strategy. Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits. But industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. They also say airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run and are in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air. BA, however, contend that the company has been recycling profits into new investment in the airline. The company says it is spending Â£6.5bn on new aircraft, new cabins and WiFi on planes. If the two sides don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then. Pilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? No 10 tells BA and pilots to 'sort out' strike Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos BA says its pilots already receive ""world-class"" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is ""fair and generous"", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too. The airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 a year, allowances included. Two weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights due to the planned industrial action. Unfortunately, due to ""human error"" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwingBA's customer service operations into a tailspinover the bank holiday weekend. On Friday, BA said the ""vast majority"" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines. BA advice,externalsays you can request a full refund, rebook your flight for another time in the next 355 days, or use the value of your fare to fly to a different destination. If your flight has been cancelled due to a strike,the Civil Aviation Authority says,externalpassengers also have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA's expense to get you to your destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline. Most affected passengers would already have been in contact with BA, but they may not have considered additional costs, such as airport parking. They are advised to keep receipts for these extra costs, and BA said it would look at refunding them on a case-by-case basis. The cost of separate hotel or accommodation bookings that cannot be used may need to be claimed from travel insurance. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out?

"Tom Hanks spoke to reporters at the Toronto Film Festival Tom Hanks has said the increasing level of cynicism in society is partly what led him to take a role as a loveable children's entertainer. The actor plays Fred Rogers in his new movie - a legendary US kids TV host whose brand was wholesome and warm. ""Cynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse,"" Hanks told reporters. ""Why? Because it's easy, and there's good money to be made."" He added: ""Cynicism is a great product to sell, and it's the perfect beginning of any examination of anything. And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you. Children's entertainer Fred Rogers died in 2003 ""But I think when Fred Rogers first saw children's programming, he saw something that was cynical, and why would you put something that is cynical in front of a two or three-year-old kid? That you are not cool because you don't have this toy? That it's funny to see someone being bopped on the head? ""That's a cynical treatment of the audience, and we have become so inured to that, that when we are met with as simple a message as 'Hey you know what, it's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood!' we get slapped a little bit. We are allowed, I think, to feel good. There's a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?"" A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood serves as the title of the Rogers film, which is directed by Marielle Heller - well known for the Oscar-nominated Can You Ever Forgive Me? Heller has explained that, because Mr Rogers (as he was known) had such little conflict in his life, he was not an obvious protagonist for a movie, and his career alone wouldn't have served as a strong enough storyline. Tom Hanks plays the gentle and softly-spoken TV host, who was usually seen in zip-up sweaters Instead, A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood follows the relationship between Mr Rogers and a journalist for Esquire magazine,who wrote a profile of the entertainer in 1998,external. The journalist who wrote the original piece, Tom Junod, possessed by trade just the kind of cynical personality Hanks refers to. But when he met Mr Rogers, he found a more complex character than he was expecting. Over a series of sittings, he and Mr Rogers developed a friendship. The entertainer won Junod over with his seemingly unrelenting kindness and empathy, helping him examine his own issues and find a deeper appreciation for life. lt is, frankly, an outstanding film - one of the best seen so far at the Toronto Film Festival and undoubtedly an awards season contender. ""Marielle Heller excels at pulling heartstrings from sturdy foundations, injecting smart and insightful details into material that could easily default to sentimentality,""wrote Eric Kohn in IndieWire,external. This video can not be played Tom Hanks leads his fans in a sing-along of his movie's theme song at the Toronto Film Festival ""Hanks isn't just good - he's transporting,""added Variety's Owen Gleiberman,external. ""He takes on Mr Rogers' legendary mannerisms and owns them, using them as a conduit to Rogers' disarming inner spirit. He makes you believe in this too-nice-for-words man... [the film] is a soft-hearted fable that works on you in an enchanting way."" The Hollywood Reporter was more sceptical,external: ""It is a sympathetic and yet entirely predictable in its dramatic trajectory of making a believer of an angry, cynical journalist. Still, the lure of the Hanks/Rogers match-up looks to stir some reasonable commercial returns."" More from Toronto: Hollywood star's 'battle' to learn Wolverhampton accent Pole dancing in film role 'hardest thing' for Jennifer Lopez Black Panther star's latest role 'a huge responsibility' The script for A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood had been floating around Hollywood for some time before production began. Hanks even passed on the role several times - but then ended up saying yes once director Marielle Heller became attached to the project. The pair had been looking to work on a film together for some time and Hanks said he felt she was the right person to deliver it to the screen. Matthew Rhys, who plays the journalist, said the film taps into a vulnerability which men in particular often keep hidden under the surface. ""Marielle talked about giving men in general a greater emotional vocabulary, or working towards articulating their emotions, and not just generally men, I think society in general would benefit from it,"" he said. Matthew Rhys (right) plays a sceptical journalist who is eventually won over my Mr Rogers' kindness ""And I think it was instantly relatable that someone was so desperately wanting to be seen, but hiding behind this castle that he built for himself, and I think it's a message of hope."" Mr Rogers, who died in 2003, isn't well known in many international territories, however, in the same way he is in the US. Therefore, while a Tom Hanks movie can generally be expected to draw the public to the cinema, the distributors may have a struggle on their hands to market it in some international territories. But by the time it reaches UK cinemas, the awards season buzz it is generating may well be enough to carry it to significant box office success. Tom Hanks leads sing-along with fans.

"A counter protest on the Broomielaw A police officer was injured as two Republican marches were held in Glasgow. Officers in riot gear and mounted police were deployed to the parades, one week after clashes between marchers and protesters in the Govan area. There were counter demonstrations at both marches but they were quickly contained by police. Eleven people were charged for a variety of offences. A ""pyrotechnic"" was thrown on Clyde Street which injured an officer. One of Police Scotland's top officers described his disgust at the ""recklessness"" displayed. Police said about 1,000 people took to the streets to either march or take part in counter protests. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins, said: ""The majority of those who took part in the processions listened to us and complied with our instructions. ""I am, however, disgusted at the recklessness and stupidity of those who decided to throw pyrotechnics, one of which injured an officer. ""He was simply carrying out a duty which allows us to facilitate people's rights and ultimately we were here today to keep everybody safe."" Allow Twitter content?

His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Charges against the 11 people arrested included a 33-year-old man accused of carrying an offensive weapon and a 15-year-old boy accused of possessing an offensive weapon. A 14-year-old boy was also among those arrested. Others were charged with being drunk and disorderly, obstructing police, public order offences and sectarian breaches of the peace. They are expected to appear in court on Monday. A major police operation was put in place The first march - A Cairde Na Heireann (Calton Republicans) - started on Millroad Street in the east end at 14:00, finishing on Clyde Street. The second event - the Friends of Irish Republican Prisoners Welfare Association parade - was due to start at Blythswood Square at 15:00 but was held up for an hour. It ended at Barrowland Park in the Gallowgate. A heavy police presence was on hand to separate both sides. The majority of counter-protesters appeared to be held at King George V Bridge, next to the Riverboat Casino. Police to have 'significant' presence at marches Legal moves to tackle sectarian disorder Fireworks, which appeared to have come from the counter-protesters, were set off, with police telling members of the public to move back from the area. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the police operation and wished a fast recovery to the injured police officer. He said: ""I am very grateful to all of the officers and police staff involved in the robust policing operation around two processions in Glasgow this afternoon. ""I hope the officer injured as a result of a pyrotechnic thrown during the event will make a full and speedy recovery. ""This is a further reminder of how Scotland's police officers put themselves in harm's way to keep all of us safe."" About 1,000 people were involved in the marches and the counter protests Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the ""robust"" policing operation While recognising the right to hold processions and demonstrations as ""central to our democratic society"", Mr Yousaf added: ""It is important that we do not lose sight of the collective need for action to achieve a zero-tolerance approach towards sectarianism and offensive behaviour. ""Scotland's communities also have a right to feel safe and to be protected from disorder and thuggery."" Glasgow City Council allowed the processions to go ahead a week after amarch through Govan was marred by sectarian violence. But there is a series of further marches planned. A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: ""We want to thank the police for everything they did to ensure that trouble was kept to a minimum yesterday. ""But with 14 processions coming up this month alone, we know this kind of march continues to disrupt Glasgow's communities and impact on policing outside the city. ""We will be very carefully considering that community impact when we receive notifications of processions in future.""

"A seven-day limit is to be introduced on the use of temporary accommodation for homeless people in Scotland. The limit on spending time in unsuitable accommodation currently applies to families and pregnant women but will be extended to everyone at risk of homelessness. Charities have previously warned people were living in bed and breakfast and hostel rooms for more than a year. The change in regulations will take place from May 2021. A Scottish government consultation on the change found 97% of respondents backed the move. Homelessness on the rise in Scotland Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""We know that people living in these unsuitable environments can for too long often lack cooking or washing facilities, and some have reported that they cannot have visits from family or friends. ""These experiences have a detrimental effect on people's physical and mental wellbeing, preventing them from rebuilding their lives. ""While temporary accommodation can offer an important emergency safety net for anyone who finds themselves homeless, such as those fleeing domestic violence, it should be a purely temporary measure."" A total of 29,894 people were assessed as homeless or threatened with homelessness in 2018-19, a 2% rise on the previous year and the third year in a row the tally has gone up Mr Stewart said the Scottish government was investing Â£32.5m in supporting local authorities to ""prioritise settled accommodation for all"". LatestScottish government figuresshow that 36,465 people asked for help to find a home from their local council in 2018-19, up 3% on the previous year. It is the second year applications have risen after a period of consistent decline since 2005-06. The figures showed also showed increasing numbers of people were also staying in temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs. There were a total of 620 breaches of the rules on suitable accommodation offered to vulnerable people or families, an increase of 225 compared with the previous year. A total of 465 of these were in Edinburgh. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We strongly welcome the announcement that the Scottish government will change the law so that people will no longer have to live in the most unsuitable forms of temporary accommodation for longer than seven days. ""This marks a major achievement for our Life in Limbo campaign, a three-year project which has sought to put an end to lengthy and dehumanising stays in unsupported hostels, hotels and B&Bs.

"This video can not be played Protesters sang the US anthem outside the consulate Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are appealing to President Donald Trump for help as they march near the US consulate general in the city. Some are carrying banners reading, ""President Trump, please save Hong Kong"" and ""Make Hong Kong great again"". The protests, now in their 14th straight week, have continued despite Hong Kong's leadership finally meeting one of the protesters' key demands. China has consistently warned other countries not to interfere. It says the situation in Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997, is purely its own internal affair. Sunday's crowd waved US flags and chanted pleas for the US to ""liberate"" Hong Kong from China. They are asking the US to pass a proposed ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"", which Democratic Senators are pushing for consideration next week.

It could also expose Chinese officials to US sanctions if they were found responsible for suppressing Hong Kong's freedoms. Protesters sang the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, and a new rallying cry of ""five demands, not one less"" - after one of their long-standing conditions for ending demonstrations was met earlier this week. Many messages directly targeted the US president's attention The protests first erupted over a controversial extradition law which would have allowed Hong Kongers to be extradited to mainland China - where a different legal system applies.

The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Seven ways China's media took on HK protests In the meantime, the protesters' demands had spiralled into calls for a much wider set of reforms. Four of their demands remain unmet: Withdrawal of the ""riot"" description used about the protests by the authorities Amnesty for all arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Universal suffrage for the elections of the chief executive and Legislative Council, Hong Kong's parliament Some also want Hong Kong's embattled political leader, Carrie Lam, to resign, accusing her of being controlled by the mainland government in Beijing. But the protests have sometimes turned violent. On Saturday, some protesters attempted to gain access to the international airport, the site of previous demonstrations. But police only allowed airline passengers with a ticket to board trains and buses bound for the terminal. By Saturday night, the situation had destabilised into running clashes between protesters and police, with tear gas being fired in the city - a common sight during the weeks of demonstrations.

About 1,000 people were involved in the marches and the counter protests Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the ""robust"" policing operation While recognising the right to hold processions and demonstrations as ""central to our democratic society"", Mr Yousaf added: ""It is important that we do not lose sight of the collective need for action to achieve a zero-tolerance approach towards sectarianism and offensive behaviour. ""Scotland's communities also have a right to feel safe and to be protected from disorder and thuggery."" Glasgow City Council allowed the processions to go ahead a week after amarch through Govan was marred by sectarian violence. But there is a series of further marches planned. A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: ""We want to thank the police for everything they did to ensure that trouble was kept to a minimum yesterday. ""But with 14 processions coming up this month alone, we know this kind of march continues to disrupt Glasgow's communities and impact on policing outside the city.

"A seven-day limit is to be introduced on the use of temporary accommodation for homeless people in Scotland. The limit on spending time in unsuitable accommodation currently applies to families and pregnant women but will be extended to everyone at risk of homelessness. Charities have previously warned people were living in bed and breakfast and hostel rooms for more than a year. The change in regulations will take place from May 2021. A Scottish government consultation on the change found 97% of respondents backed the move. Homelessness on the rise in Scotland Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""We know that people living in these unsuitable environments can for too long often lack cooking or washing facilities, and some have reported that they cannot have visits from family or friends. ""These experiences have a detrimental effect on people's physical and mental wellbeing, preventing them from rebuilding their lives. ""While temporary accommodation can offer an important emergency safety net for anyone who finds themselves homeless, such as those fleeing domestic violence, it should be a purely temporary measure."" A total of 29,894 people were assessed as homeless or threatened with homelessness in 2018-19, a 2% rise on the previous year and the third year in a row the tally has gone up Mr Stewart said the Scottish government was investing Â£32.5m in supporting local authorities to ""prioritise settled accommodation for all"". LatestScottish government figuresshow that 36,465 people asked for help to find a home from their local council in 2018-19, up 3% on the previous year. It is the second year applications have risen after a period of consistent decline since 2005-06. The figures showed also showed increasing numbers of people were also staying in temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs. There were a total of 620 breaches of the rules on suitable accommodation offered to vulnerable people or families, an increase of 225 compared with the previous year. A total of 465 of these were in Edinburgh. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We strongly welcome the announcement that the Scottish government will change the law so that people will no longer have to live in the most unsuitable forms of temporary accommodation for longer than seven days. ""This marks a major achievement for our Life in Limbo campaign, a three-year project which has sought to put an end to lengthy and dehumanising stays in unsupported hostels, hotels and B&Bs. ""This decision is a recognition of the resolve of our clients to shine a light on the inhumane conditions they were experiencing and the determination to ensure no-one else was subjected to these prolonged stays.""

"Joichi Ito has previously faced calls to resign over Epstein's donations The head of MIT's Media Lab has resigned following revelations about the academic centre's financial ties to the late US financier Jeffrey Epstein. MIT President Rafael Reifconfirmed the resignation of Joichi Ito,externalon Saturday following media reports. Mr Reif added that university was engaging a law firm to conduct an independent review. It comes a day after a New Yorker article outlined donations Epstein made and solicited for MIT. The article also alleged that MIT staff sought to conceal the university's relationship with Epstein,who died in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. ""The acceptance of the Epstein gifts involved a mistake of judgment,"" Mr Reif said in a statement. In an email published by the New York Times, Mr Ito told university provost Martin Schmidt that he had made the decision to step down ""after giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks"". Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? He apologised an a separate email to members of the Lab, saying: ""While this chapter is truly difficult, I am confident the lab will persevere."" Mr Ito shared the emails with the New York Times, where he has served as a board member since 2012. According to the New Yorker, internal MIT emails and documents show that, although Epstein was blacklisted from the university's official donor database, Mr Ito and other Lab staff continued to accept contributions from him and actively tried to conceal where they came from. Epstein was also allegedly consulted about the use of funds, and served as an intermediary between the Lab and other wealthy donors. The New Yorker alleges that Epstein helped to secure at least $7.5m (Â£6.1m) in donations, including $2m from Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Epstein was already a convicted sex offender when MIT's Media Lab began accepting his donations Mr Ito has acknowledged that he had accepted a $525,000 donation from Epstein, along with $1.2m for his own personal investment funds. A spokesperson for Mr Gates told the New Yorker that ""any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false"". Mr Ito first revealed in August that he had accepted donations from Mr Epstein,external, along with investments into his own personal funds. The revelation prompted calls for him to resign as director, and two academic staff announced plans to leave the Lab. Mr Ito met around 200 staff earlier this week to apologise again and seek to make amends to the centre. But towards the end of the meeting, Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the Lab, interrupted and said he had told Mr Ito to take the donation and would do it again. The Media Lab was behind several technological innovations According to the MIT Technology Review, the meeting ended with one woman in tears. Another told Mr Negroponte to ""shut up,"" adding: ""We've been cleaning up your messes for the past eight years."" MIT's Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research centre founded in 1985. It has been behind several technological innovations, including the electronic ink used in the Amazon Kindle, and video game Guitar Hero. Much of the lab's funding comes from nearly 90 corporate sponsors, although these companies are not allowed to support or direct any of the research.

"Irish PM Leo Varadkar has said he ""does not expect any breakthroughs"" in his meeting with Boris Johnson on Monday. Speaking at a press conference in Waterford, he said that the meeting is ""an opportunity to establish a personal relationship"". On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said that some checks on goods and live animals may need to take place near the Irish border in a no-deal Brexit Checks would take place at ports, airports and firms, he said. What is the Irish border backstop? Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? How could backstop alternatives work? UK PM Boris Johnson has said he would""rather be dead in a ditch than delay Brexit"", which is set for 31 October. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar says there may be some checks 'near the border' in a no-deal Speaking on Friday, Mr Varadkar said: ""It's an opportunity for us to talk about each other's positions in relation to the European Union and the withdrawal agreement, to explore where there might be common ground. ""Also as well to talk about Northern Ireland because separate from the major issue of Brexit there is the ongoing suspension of the Assembly and the executive in Northern Ireland."" Mr Varadkar has said he would continue efforts to avoid a no-deal, but would not do so ""at any cost"", adding that the EU had still not received any workable alternative to the backstop from the UK. ""I do fear it, but I am prepared for it,"" he told business leaders in Dublin on Thursday night. Senator Marshall said the Irish government will be mandated to protect the integrity of the border The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland. It would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. It will not apply if the UK leaves without a deal in October. By John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor We know that the responsibility of the Irish government as a member of the EU would be to collect customs duties and to protect the integrity of the single market. The question is how the Republic's government would fulfil those responsibilities. This week we have seen Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney getting closer to saying 'listen folks, some of this stuff would have to happen, probably close to the border'. The big one is around food and agriculture. Food products coming into the EU from a non-member state must go through what is called a border inspection post, which must be in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry. The discussion is around what is the immediate vicinity of the point of entry. Is it a mile from the border? Is it 10 miles? Where is it? The taoiseach said tariffs would apply to ""goods imported into Ireland from the United Kingdom and vice versa"". ""The tariff schedules are already known,"" he said. ""You will need to be registered as an importer-exporter and you will need to make customs declarations."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Varadkar said that in the event of no-deal, the common travel area would remain in place. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald called Mr Varadkar's comments ""extremely unhelpful"" and said checks would ""damage border communities, harm the economy and undermine the architecture of the peace process"". ""These are fundamental issues that will have a massive impact on our country for generations to come and it is the job of an taoiseach and our European partners to prevent this disastrous scenario from emerging,"" she added. Meanwhile, the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland has said that any post-Brexit checks near the border in the Republic are likely to be matched by similar checks in the UK. Seamus Leheny, policy manager for the Freight Transport Association, said checks would ""probably have to be reflected on the northern side of the border"". The government has always insisted it would not be putting up any new infrastructure near the border. ""They might say that now, but that's not a sustainable approach to managing the Irish border because if you don't have controls in place, how does the UK government control what is entering into the GB market,"" said Mr Leheny. Despite the warning, DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted there will be no new infrastructure at the border in Northern Ireland, even if the Republic introduces checks after Brexit. ""There's been a lot of speculation up until now,"" she said. ""What we need to do is look at the facts and the facts are that the government has said very clearly that they will not be putting infrastructure at the border."" Asked about how the UK was going to control what came across the border into Northern Ireland, she said ""alternative arrangements"" could be put in place, but not infrastructure. Meanwhile, Irish broadcaster RTÃ reportsthe UK has proposed stripping all elements of the backstop out of the withdrawal agreement.,external The only elements of the agreement left is a commitment to the all-island electricity market, the Common Travel Area and the rights of EU citizens, it said. The UK has instead proposed that both sides would make a commitment to no hard border, but only after Britain had left the European Union. What would change with a no-deal Brexit? What could no deal mean for the Irish border? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?
