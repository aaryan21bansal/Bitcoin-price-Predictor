"Nadal has now won 18 Grand Slam titles Rafael Nadal maintained his stranglehold on the French Open by beating Austrian fourth seed Dominic Thiem in four sets to lift a 12th men's singles title. The Spaniard won for the third straight year at Roland Garros with a 6-3 5-7 6-1 6-1 victory in a high-quality final. The 33-year-old is the first player to win 12 singles titles at the same Grand Slam and has now won 18 majors overall. ""I can't explain what I've achieved and how I feel. It's a dream,"" said Nadal. ""To play for the first time in 2005 - I never thought in 2019 I'd still be here. It's an incredible moment and very special for me."" It leaves the left-hander two Grand Slam titles adrift of Switzerland's Roger Federer, who he beat in the semi-finals, and three clear of Serbian world number one Novak Djokovic, whose bid to hold all four majors was ended by Thiem. The second seed slid to the red dirt in triumph when he clinched victory on the second match point, lying behind the baseline with his arms outstretched as he contemplated the magnitude of his achievement. With clay plastered over his back, he clambered to his feet and took the acclaim of an enthralled Roland Garros crowd which has become accustomed to seeing him triumph. Thiem, 25, suffered his second Grand Slam final defeat after losing in three sets to Nadal in last year's final. Relive Nadal's French Open final win Return to tennis my best decision - Barty reflects on French Open triumph Rafael Nadal has closed to within two of Roger Federer in the tally of men's Grand Slam singles titles Hundreds of Spanish fans milling around outside Chatrier, identified by their red and yellow flags, football shirts and facepaint, has become an almost annual event before the men's final at Roland Garros since 2005. Nadal has won on all but three of his appearances here, with his only defeats coming in the 2009 fourth-round by Robin Soderling and 2015 quarter-finals against Djokovic. In 2016, he pulled out before the third round with injury. That meant he went into Sunday's final with a Roland Garros record of 92 wins and two defeats. A fiercely contested first set was closer than the scoreline suggests, Nadal rattling off the final four games to edge ahead after 55 tense minutes. Both players understood the importance of making a quick start, Nadal attempting to take advantage of any mental and physical fatigue in his opponent, who only finished his delayed semi-final against top seed Djokovic less than 24 hours earlier. The result was a physical battle, full of intense rallies as each man tried to gain the upper hand by brute force. Nadal's first French Open victory came in 2005 Thiem earned the first break point of the match at 2-2, putting away an overhead which left many inside Chatrier - which only included a handful of red and white-clad Austrian fans - jumping to their feet in celebration. Nadal responded instantly, earning three break points in the next game and taking the second with a precise forehand which fizzed past Thiem. Sticking with Nadal was one thing, turning that into taking a set off the champion proved to be a tougher task. Nadal saw off another break point in a lengthy service game for a 4-3 lead, a pivotal moment as he moved 5-3 ahead as an aggressive backhand rocked Thiem on break point. That left Nadal serving for the opening set, which he clinched when Thiem dragged a backhand wide on the second set point. Thiem knew he could scarcely afford to go a set behind the reigning champion - and falling two adrift would have all but extinguished his hopes. Following the intensity of the opening set, the level dropped in the second as serve dominated. Only six receiving points were won in the opening 11 games - five for Nadal and just one for Thiem - before Thiem, out of nowhere, found himself with two set points. And the Austrian levelled the match when Nadal blinked again, hitting a backhand long after a 10-shot rally. But the exertions of winning that set, playing four days in a row and having 24 hours fewer than Nadal to recover from the semi-finals, perhaps took their toll. Thiem was playing in his second Grand Slam final Nadal nipped off court at the end of the set, possibly for a mental reset as much as anything else, leaving Thiem waiting on the baseline for the start of the third set. Whether Nadal was using delaying tactics or not, the break of momentum worked. Thiem delivered a poor service game as Nadal broke to love, the Spaniard backing that up with a hold to love sealed with an exquisite stun volley that even prompted a thumbs up from the Austrian. Nadal won the opening 11 points of the third and clinched the double break with a trademark forehand down the line, an exuberant quadruple fist-pump celebration along the baseline stressing its importance. Thiem won just seven points in the third set before ending a miserable 30 minutes with another unforced error into the net. He began to look weary in the fourth set - particularly mentally - and Nadal smelt blood. The Spaniard moved into a 3-0 lead, after seeing off break points in his two service games, before breaking again for a 5-1 lead. Although Thiem saved one match point, he could not prevent the inevitable and batted a Nadal serve long to spark jubilant celebrations from the Spaniard. Former British number one Greg Rusedski on BBC Radio 5 Live That was by far the best match we've seen at these championships. Thiem was physically standing toe-to-toe with Nadal in the first set. We knew Thiem had to get off a great start to win his first major and he did that. It was electrifying. It had a different feel to last year's final. Thiem wasn't overawed. He was not like a deer in headlights as he was last year in his first major final. But it was about as well as I've seen Nadal play on a clay court and that's saying a lot for an 12-time champion.

"Protesters set up roadblocks, businesses remained closed and people stayed inside Sudanese security forces have fired tear gas and live ammunition to disperse protesters setting up barricades in Khartoum. Four people have been killed on the first day of a strike, according to doctors aligned to the opposition. Campaigners have called for ongoing civil disobedience from Sunday to make it as difficult as possible for the military to govern Sudan. It comes days after a military crackdown left dozens dead. The warlord who may control Sudan's future Sudan's crisis: What you need to know Return of the feared Janjaweed Is Sudan a new regional battleground? A number of Sudan's bank, airport and electricity workers were arrested ahead of the strike against the military rule, the main protest group said. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) said employees were also being threatened by the authorities to scare them into going to work instead of taking part in the nationwide strike. The ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) has made no comment. The military took over Sudan after persistent protests led to the ousting of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April. They promised a transition to civilian rule. But pro-democracy campaigners say the military council cannot be trusted after Monday's crackdown against a sit-in demonstration in Khartoum - and they have rejected an offer of talks. People injured in Khartoum's crackdown are recovering in hospital In a separate development, three opposition figures involved in mediation efforts have been arrested. Groups of young men have set up barricades in roads as part of the civil disobedience campaign. Most offices and businesses remain shut and traffic is light in the city, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the Sudanese capital. There have been reports of gunfire as security forces maintain their deployments across most parts of the city. Protest leaders have asked people to stay at home. They say that demonstrations are no longer possible because of the violent crackdown by the military. ""The civil disobedience movement will begin Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,"" the SPA said in a statement. ""Disobedience is a peaceful act capable of bringing to its knees the most powerful weapons arsenal in the world."" Opposition politician Mohamed Esmat was detained on Friday soon after his meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, aides said. Meanwhile, Ismail Jalab, a leader of the rebel SPLM-N group, and his spokesman Mubarak Ardol were arrested early on Saturday. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, and analysts say the arrests suggest that Ethiopian mediation efforts have not been taken seriously by the military. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is trying to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table On Wednesday, the SPLM-N said its deputy head, Yasir Arman, was arrested at his house in Khartoum. He had returned from exile following the downfall of Mr Bashir. Mr Esmat and Mr Jalab are both leading members of the Alliance for Freedom and Change, an umbrella organisation of opposition figures, protest leaders and rebel groups. ""This amounts to a practical response from the military council that effectively rejects the Ethiopian prime minister's mediation effort,"" Khalid Omar Yousef, an opposition alliance leader said. The TMC seems emboldened by the political and financial support it has received from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, none of which are keen on fully fledged democracy, says BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper. Opposition activists say a feared paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killed 108 people in the crackdown, with at least 40 bodies pulled from the River Nile in Khartoum on Tuesday. The Sudanese authorities however, put the figure at 46. The leader of the RSF says rogue elements and drug dealers were behind the violence. This video can not be played Sudan's military attacks protesters The RSF, formerly known as the Janjaweed militia, gained notoriety for brutal atrocities in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Khartoum residents have told the BBC that they are living in fear in the capital. A number of women arrested by the RSF said they were repeatedly beaten with sticks and threatened with execution. They said RSF troops had told them to run for their lives, then opened fire. Other victims, they said, were forced to drink sewage water and urinated on. On Thursday the African Union suspended Sudan's membership ""with immediate effect"" and warned of further action if power was not transferred to a civilian authority.

"Leyton Orient captain Jobi McAnuff has paid tribute to late boss Justin Edinburgh and said the club will continue to build on his legacy. Edinburgh died on Saturday aged 49, five days after a cardiac arrest. McAnuffdescribed the Orient manager,externalas a ""leader, a fantastic manager and a truly great man"". ""You've helped rebuild what was a broken club and been the driving force returning it to where it belongs,"" the 37-year-old winger added. Edinburgh, who won the FA Cup as a Tottenham player, managed Northampton Town, Gillingham and Newport County before moving to Orient in November 2017. McAnuff said he was ""a man who inspired so many of us with his drive, passion and sheer desire to win."" ""A man who had so much love for this game and even more for his family, my heart goes out to them at this tragic time,"" he added. Orient boss Edinburgh dies aged 49 The winger said Edinburgh ""always did it with a smile on [his] face and with a huge respect for others"". ""I am so grateful that I got to share some truly amazing moments with you and know how much winning the league with this club meant to you,"" he added. ""It was a privilege and an honour to serve as your captain and these happy memories will lie with me forever. ""You were always at the centre of all the jokes and the banter with the boys and staff, we had so many laughs and good times. ""You've helped rebuild what was a broken club and been the driving force returning it to where it belongs. ""That will be your legacy here and as difficult as it will be, it's now up to us to carry that on and make sure all of that hard work is continued and built upon."" BBC London Leyton Orient correspondent Dave Victor - a supporter since 1971, who started reporting on the side in 1983: ""I don't think we can still quite believe what has happened. It was only three weeks ago when there were over 23,000 Leyton Orient supporters at Wembley for the final of the FA Trophy, and although Leyton Orient missed out on that occasion, it didn't really matter because everyone was there to celebrate Leyton Orient's return back to the Football League. ""When Justin took over in December 2017, Leyton Orient were on course for what would have been their third relegation in four years, they had gone three months without a win. They didn't get off to a good start under Justin, they lost their opening game, but Justin took responsibility immediately. ""He had an incredible impact on the club. And what is remarkable is Leyton Orient's success was built on the squad that Justin inherited; virtually every player got better because of the way he inspired and changed the culture of the club. ""He was very committed to them; he was very loyal to his players; he was very critical of supporters that got on the back of individuals. He wasn't just loyal to those in the side, often when I spoke to him after the game, he made a point of talking about the players who weren't actually in the squad, but had still contributed to the success because of the way of which they had gone about their training. ""There was an integrity about Justin Edinburgh. There was a clarity about Justin Edinburgh. Everybody bought in and it felt as if it was just the beginning. You got the sense that it was the start of something special at Leyton Orient and Justin Edinburgh would have gone on to be a very successful manager in the Football League. But this is about reflecting on a man who had enormous passion and pride, and what he was proud of more than anything in football was his family and, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with them."" Supporters laid flowers outside Leyton Orient's home ground Brisbane Road on Sunday as they paid their respects to Edinburgh. Floral tributes, signed football shirts and scarves were left as a mark of respect as both home supporters and fans from other clubs marked a solemn day for the east London club.

"Neil Woodford is unconventional and has been successful for investors The boss of broker Hargreaves Lansdown has issued an apology following the suspension of a fund it sells. Chris Hill, chief executive, said he shares clients' ""disappointment and frustration"". The Woodford Equity Income Fund, managed by Neil Woodford, stopped investors cashing out this week. In spite of the suspension of a fund it promoted to clients through its ""Wealth 50"" list of top buys, the firm stands by its research, Mr Hill said. Mr Woodford, one of the UK's best-known stockpickers, suspended the fund after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. ""I would like to apologise personally to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems with the Woodford Equity Income Fund,"" Mr Hill said. ""We all share their disappointment and frustration. Our priority right now is to support our clients and keep them informed."" The UK's financial regulator ""should have been awake"" to problems at Mr Woodford's investment fund, former City Minister Lord Myners told the Today Programme on Friday. He told the BBC the Financial Conduct Authority had missed ""clear warning signs"" that things were going badly. ""Our aim remains to provide the best possible service and choices to allow people to manage their investments simply and effectively,"" said Mr Hill. ""The shortcomings of one fund should not detract from the benefits of favourite fund lists like the Wealth 50. ""We are confident in the robustness of how we analyse, research and compile our favourite fund list with a focus on ensuring best value for customers; nonetheless, we are reviewing this specific situation to ensure we learn from it and address it for the benefit of our customers going forward."" On Monday, Hargreaves Lansdown dropped the Woodford fund off its favourite list. On Wednesday, it bowed to pressure to drop its platform fee for Woodford investors. Investors are charged both by their broker and the manager themselves. While Hargreaves Lansdown cut its fee, Mr Woodford has not cut his management fee. On Thursday, chair of the Treasury Committee Nicky Morgan said investors in the Woodford Equity Income Fund should not be charged management fees while trading in the fund was suspended.

"Protesters set up roadblocks, businesses remained closed and people stayed inside Sudanese security forces have fired tear gas and live ammunition to disperse protesters setting up barricades in Khartoum. Four people have been killed on the first day of a strike, according to doctors aligned to the opposition. Campaigners have called for ongoing civil disobedience from Sunday to make it as difficult as possible for the military to govern Sudan. It comes days after a military crackdown left dozens dead. The warlord who may control Sudan's future Sudan's crisis: What you need to know Return of the feared Janjaweed Is Sudan a new regional battleground? A number of Sudan's bank, airport and electricity workers were arrested ahead of the strike against the military rule, the main protest group said. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) said employees were also being threatened by the authorities to scare them into going to work instead of taking part in the nationwide strike. The ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) has made no comment. The military took over Sudan after persistent protests led to the ousting of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April. They promised a transition to civilian rule. But pro-democracy campaigners say the military council cannot be trusted after Monday's crackdown against a sit-in demonstration in Khartoum - and they have rejected an offer of talks. People injured in Khartoum's crackdown are recovering in hospital In a separate development, three opposition figures involved in mediation efforts have been arrested. Groups of young men have set up barricades in roads as part of the civil disobedience campaign. Most offices and businesses remain shut and traffic is light in the city, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the Sudanese capital. There have been reports of gunfire as security forces maintain their deployments across most parts of the city. Protest leaders have asked people to stay at home. They say that demonstrations are no longer possible because of the violent crackdown by the military. ""The civil disobedience movement will begin Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,"" the SPA said in a statement. ""Disobedience is a peaceful act capable of bringing to its knees the most powerful weapons arsenal in the world."" Opposition politician Mohamed Esmat was detained on Friday soon after his meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, aides said. Meanwhile, Ismail Jalab, a leader of the rebel SPLM-N group, and his spokesman Mubarak Ardol were arrested early on Saturday. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, and analysts say the arrests suggest that Ethiopian mediation efforts have not been taken seriously by the military. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is trying to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table On Wednesday, the SPLM-N said its deputy head, Yasir Arman, was arrested at his house in Khartoum. He had returned from exile following the downfall of Mr Bashir. Mr Esmat and Mr Jalab are both leading members of the Alliance for Freedom and Change, an umbrella organisation of opposition figures, protest leaders and rebel groups. ""This amounts to a practical response from the military council that effectively rejects the Ethiopian prime minister's mediation effort,"" Khalid Omar Yousef, an opposition alliance leader said. The TMC seems emboldened by the political and financial support it has received from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, none of which are keen on fully fledged democracy, says BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper. Opposition activists say a feared paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killed 108 people in the crackdown, with at least 40 bodies pulled from the River Nile in Khartoum on Tuesday. The Sudanese authorities however, put the figure at 46. The leader of the RSF says rogue elements and drug dealers were behind the violence. This video can not be played Sudan's military attacks protesters The RSF, formerly known as the Janjaweed militia, gained notoriety for brutal atrocities in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Khartoum residents have told the BBC that they are living in fear in the capital. A number of women arrested by the RSF said they were repeatedly beaten with sticks and threatened with execution. They said RSF troops had told them to run for their lives, then opened fire. Other victims, they said, were forced to drink sewage water and urinated on. On Thursday the African Union suspended Sudan's membership ""with immediate effect"" and warned of further action if power was not transferred to a civilian authority.

"Michael Gove says he wants to replace VAT after Brexit if he becomes PM, as he continues to face questions about taking cocaine as a young journalist. A Times article Mr Gove wrote in 1999 - around the time he admits having taken the drug - has been republished. In it he criticised ""middle class professionals"" who took drugs - leading to headlines calling him a ""hypocrite"". Meanwhile, Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson has insisted only he can beat both Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid, another of the 11 Tory MPs who have said they want to replace Theresa May, received a boost to his leadership campaign on Saturday after he wasbacked by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Ruth Davidson said Sajid Javid has a vision to unite a ""divided Britain"" Mr Gove announced his plan to replace VAT in the Sunday Telegraph, writing that,externalhis ""business know-how"" had allowed him to bring in positive changes to education, the environment and the justice system while in his various ministerial roles. ""My economic plan is driven by the need to increase investment, productivity and wages across the country, with a special focus on helping those areas and regions where productivity is lower,"" he wrote. ""It would mean reducing the regulations which hold business back, cutting and reforming taxes - such as business rates - which put pressure on small businesses and undermine our high streets, using the opportunity of life outside the EU to look to replace VAT with a lower, simpler, sales tax,"" he added. Who will replace Theresa May? How the UK's next prime minister will be chosen Mr Gove, who is due to appear on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show later,admitted on Friday to taking cocaine at several ""social events""more than 20 years ago. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Javid said it was not for him to ""pass judgment"" on fellow leadership contenders, but stressed that people who take class A drugs should think about the entire supply chain. ""Anyone who takes drugs should be thinking about how they are not just hurting themselves, but about how they are destroying so many countless lives along the way"", he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Fellow leadership hopeful Dominic Raab, who has previously admitted smoking cannabis, told the BBC's Today programme the admission should not result in Mr Gove being barred from the race. Some of the other candidates have also admitted taking drugs - including Rory Stewart, who has apologised for smoking opium at a wedding in Iran 15 years ago, and Jeremy Hunt, who told the Times he had drunk a cannabis lassi while backpacking through India. And in an appearance on Have I Got News For You in 2005, Mr Johnson admitted being given cocaine but suggested he had not actually taken it, saying: ""I think I was once given cocaine but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar."" However, the emergence of Mr Gove's 1999 article has led tocriticism in the Mail on Sunday,externalandthe Observer,externalwho quote criticism from drug charities and former police officers. It comes as Mr Johnson, in his first major interview of the campaign, compared the Labour and Brexit Party leaders to sea monsters from Greek mythology. ""I truly believe only I can steer the country between the Scylla and Charybdis of Corbyn and Farage and on to calmer water,"" hetold the Sunday Times,external. ""This can only be achieved by delivering Brexit as promised on 31 October and delivering a One Nation Tory agenda,"" he added. Mr Johnson said as prime minister, he would refuse to pay the EU a Â£39bn settlement until there was ""greater clarity"" about a future relationship. He also said he would scrap the Irish backstop and would only settle the border issue when Brussels was ready to agree to a deal. Meanwhile, Mr Javid said he would pay for a ""multi-billion pound"" spending increase in education by slowing down government debt repayment. He said that could free between Â£15 billion and Â£25 billion a year, some of which would go to the education system. ""I want to see a multi-year, multi-billion pound boost in investment and spending in schools, and really change the life chances of so many young people,"" he told Sky News. On Friday, Theresa May officially stepped down as the leader of the Conservative Party. She will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen. Leadership nominations will close at 17:00 BST on Monday, the party has said. Candidates need eight MPs to back them. MPs will then vote for their preferred candidates in a series of secret ballots held on 13, 18, 19 and 20 June.
