"Boris Johnson will hold post-Brexit trade talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen via video link on Monday next week. The UK and EU have said no major progress has been made towards a deal after four rounds of talks this year. Both sides were due to decide by the end of June whether the current deadline for negotiating a deal should be extended beyond the end of December. On Friday, the UK formally confirmed it will not extend the transition period. Cabinet Office ministerMichael Gove said in a tweet,externalthat he had chaired a meeting with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic in which he said the ""moment for extension has now passed"". ""On 1 January 2021 we will take back control and regain our political and economic independence,"" he added. A UK government spokesman said both sides had also agreed an ""intensified"" schedule of weekly talks throughout the month of July. This will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings in London and Brussels, if coronavirus guidelines allow, he added. UK backtracks on full EU border checks post-Brexit Scottish and Welsh FMs push for Brexit extension What are the sticking points in the trade talks? European Council President Charles Michel and European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli will also take part in the video call on Monday. Mrs von der Leyen said she was ""looking forward"" to the meeting, while UK chief negotiator David Frost said he was ""very pleased"" an ""intensified talks process"" had been agreed.

But he said the government's policy on not extending the transition period - during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union - ""remains valid"". Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the Commons the UK will ""under no circumstances"" accept an extension to the transition period. He said the EU's Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier had indicated progress can be made on issues including fisheries and state aid. but some EU member states had been a ""little more reluctant"". ""I think it would be in everyone's interests, EU member states, the Commission, and of course the UK government, if Michel Barnier were able to use the flexibility that he has deployed in the past in order to secure an arrangement that would work in everyone's interests,"" he told MPs. It comes after Mr Barnier said there had been ""no significant areas of progress"" at last week's negotiating round. Likewise his UK counterpart Mr Frost said progress ""remains limited,"" and negotiators were ""reaching the limits"" of what could be achieved in formal talks. Differences between the two sides remain on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. Speaking after his meeting with Michael Gove, Maros Sefcovic said it would be ""extremely useful"" if the UK could provide technical clarifications on customs IT systems at Northern Ireland ports by the end of June. He added that he wanted to have ""the specialised committee meetings organised in the course of summer so we can, I would say, bring the momentum into these discussions"". He added: ""We can also proceed with important conclusions in early September because time is really pressing and the clock is ticking, and I think we need tangible results in that process.""

"There were ""tragic consequences"" of moving patients from hospitals to care homes at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, care chiefs in England say. An Association of Directors of Adult Social Services report says a lack of testing in England may have sped up the spread of coronavirus in care settings. ADASS also said the impact of Covid-19 meant many care providers faced financial problems. The government said funding was being put in to local care services. An extra Â£3.8 billion has also been provided to councils to fund social care, it added. The ADASS report on the impact of the pandemic on care services is based on a survey of 146 out of the 151 directors of social care in English councils. They point to the problems caused by the  rapid discharge of patients from hospitals into care homes in the first weeks of the pandemic. Coronavirus deaths: How big is the epidemic in care homes? Coronavirus: Care homes could 'go to the wall' as costs rise Coronavirus: Care home residents face steep hike in fees More than half of directors believe people were not tested before being discharged. They also raise concerns about a lack of checks on whether the homes people were going to had enough personal protective equipment (PPE). James Bullion, president of ADASS, said: ""Just assuming the homes could cope, and assuming that homes had the PPE to cope, wasn't the right thing to do. ""And that tells us that social care was an afterthought rather than a forethought of a whole system approach to discharge and that has had terrible consequences."" He said it was right to try to move people out of hospital at that time. But he added: ""It is absolutely crucial that we learn the lesson that you can't think about the health service without thinking about social care."" Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire has seen 16 of its residents die with Covid-19. It saw its first case on March 24, but managers do not know how the virus got into the home. Wren Hall did take people discharged from hospital. Most had been tested, but sometimes that was days before they were transferred. Anita Astle, the home's managing director says it has been a deeply distressing time, emotionally and financially. ""The first thing is losing people we cared about and didn't expect to lose. Our staff teams were grieving, but at the same time we were aware that we needed to fill beds for for financial viability and job security. ""We did feel under pressure to take people from hospital, whether or not they were Covid positive, because we needed to keep the business going."" But she said that, if there is a second wave of coronavirus, care homes would make very different decisions. ""We won't be taking positive people from hospital. We will be consulting our staff team and families of those we're supporting and we'll create a plan that meets those people's requests and expectations."" Before the pandemic most directors said they were concerned about the financial viability of some of the care providers in their area. Now with the extra costs of PPE, staffing and with care home vacancies resulting from the pandemic, a quarter say they are worried about the ability of most of the companies in their area to survive. And 7% say they are worried about the sustainability of all local care providers. They are calling for the government to provide more funding to help stabilise the care system. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Adult social care will continue to get all the support and resources they need to tackle the impacts of the pandemic, with Â£3.2bn for local authorities to help address pressures on local services, including in in adult social care, and Â£600m to control infections in care homes.""

"This video can not be played Suffolk Police officers ask for the black couple's details ""because we can"" An exchange in which a police officer accused a black woman of ""jumping on the bandwagon"" was ""clumsy"", a deputy chief constable said. Two officers had asked a black couple outside their Ipswich home for their details, saying ""because we can"". When the woman complained, an officer said: ""You've just jumped on the bandwagon in the current climate."" Deputy Chief Constable of Suffolk Police, Rachel Kearton, said it would be investigated internally. The exchange, filmed on the woman's mobile phone, has been viewed on Twitter more than 1.5m times after it was shared by the couple's daughter, Maja Antoine. In the video, the officers appear to want to check a driving licence because the couple had ""paid attention"" to them while they worked on an operation on the same street on Wednesday.

Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Kearton told BBC Look East she could see the incident was upsetting Franstine Jones, the former president of the National Black Police Association, said it was ""just not professional"" to ask someone for their details ""because we can"". ""It leaves me wondering about the mindset of our officers in Suffolk going out on the street doing their policing,"" she said. ""If they think every interaction with a black person - if they are not happy about the way they are being spoken to, or the way they are being treated, or asking for an explanation -  that officer is going to think 'oh here we go, they are just jumping on the bandwagon'.

""It isn't always perfect, we do have mistakes and weaknesses, however, we do care for our communities and we do hold very close to our hearts our sense of professionalism and integrity and to do the right thing and respect all of our members of our communities to keep them safe. ""That is what was at the heart of what the police officers were trying to do, however it appears to have been carried out in a clumsy fashion which will be dealt with by the constabulary and we will do better in the future.""

"The project at Pembroke Dock will enable technology developers to test marine energy devices A Â£60m marine power project has been approved for Pembrokeshire - with 1,800 jobs expected to be generated over the next 15 years. The investment at Pembroke Dock is being backed by the private sector and supported by the local authority. The project will enable technology developers to test marine energy devices in the Milford Haven Waterway. Pembrokeshire council leader David Simpson said they were ready to ""accelerate working"" on the scheme. The business case for the development has been backed by both the Welsh and UK governments. Pembrokeshire council said the project was expected to generate Â£73.5m a year for the Swansea Bay City Region economy. ""The impact of Covid-19 has further heightened the importance of Pembroke Dock Marine, so the project's approval is very welcome news for Pembrokeshire's residents and businesses. ""This project will place Pembrokeshire and the City Region at the heart of a growing global industry, helping further raise the region's profile as a place to do business and invest in."" What are Wales' city and region deals? 75 years since the Pembroke Dock oil bombing When Wales made the Millennium Falcon Andy Jones, chief executive of the Port of Milford Haven, said: ""This is an exciting step - not just for Pembrokeshire and the region but also for our economy, our communities and our environment as we work towards net zero decarbonisation targets.""

"More than 31,000 close contacts of people with coronavirus were identified during the first week of the test and trace system in England, figures show. Of those, 85% were reached and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. This was from 8,000 people testing positive for the virus. Two thirds of them gave details of close contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was the public's ""civic duty"" to follow instructions given by contact tracers. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he added he was not ruling out enforcement measures to make people self-isolate for 14 days if asked to do so. About 25,000 contact tracers were recruited in England and started work at the end of May. The NHS figures, which cover 28 May to 3 June, are the first to be released showing the progress of the contact tracing scheme. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, said the system was working well but it ""can, needs to and will get better"". The system has been unable to reach 15% of close contacts identified - 4,809 people - either because they were unavailable, their contact details were wrong or they did not respond to texts, emails or calls from contact tracers. Appearing alongside Mr Hancock at the briefing, Baroness Harding said that did not necessarily mean those people had not self-isolated, adding: ""Only a small minority don't want to self isolate and we need to understand why this is and what we can do to support them to stay at home."" She said earlier there had been ""good numbers of compliance"" with 26,985 contacts of positive cases identified, reached and asked to self-isolate. This video can not be played Baroness Dido Harding: 'We are overstating those actively ignoring self-isolation advice' One contact tracer, Josie, has been working from her home in Redcar, North Yorkshire, to trace contacts. ""Everybody that I've spoke to has been more than happy to share the information that we need,"" she told the BBC. Baroness Harding added the ""number one thing"" that would improve the programme was more people getting tested for the virus once they develop symptoms. How does contact tracing work in England? Coronavirus contact tracing: My new skill Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app? Appealing to people to comply with the measures, Mr Hancock said: ""Please do it to protect your loved ones, do it to protect your community, do it to protect the nation and do it to protect the NHS."" In response to a question about potential enforcement to make more people co-operate with the scheme, Mr Hancock said: ""We're not ruling it out, but we don't think we need it at the moment."" He said the ""best way forward"" was to see an increase in the number of people being contacted. Contact tracers are told to try to contact people 10 times in a 24-hour period. Most of the people called in the first week were identified by local public health teams as part of investigations into outbreaks. This video can not be played An anonymous contact tracer told the BBC they'd only made one call and were ""paid to sit there"" As lockdown eases, and people start to return to work and go out to shops, it is expected the number of contacts people have will start to grow from a low starting point. In the first week of the test and trace scheme, contact was made with 5,407 people who tested positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide details of recent contacts. Their cases may also have been investigated as part of a local outbreak. Some 2,710 with positive tests were not reached, either because their contact details were not correct or they decided not to give out information about their contacts. The data from the test and trace system in England has been eagerly anticipated - after all, this system will be crucial in helping contain local outbreaks, enabling the country to ease out of lockdown. It is still early days, but how should we interpret these findings? Firstly, the system seems to be pretty good at reaching the contacts of people who have tested positive, if those positive cases engage with the contact tracers and provide details in the first place. The problem is a third of people who test positive are not providing details. This could be because the contact tracers are not as good as they should be at tracking those who do not engage with the online forms (the first point of call for the system). There have been suggestions that sufficient translation support is not always available, for example. But incorrect contact details being provided and people simply refusing to take calls - despite repeated attempts - are certainly factors too. The key to the success of the system will be both an efficient service and public engagement in taking calls and following the advice to self-isolate. It's a way of controlling the spread of the virus by asking people who have tested positive for coronavirus to share information on who they have been in close contact with. It starts withgetting a test,externalif you havesymptoms,external. If you test positive for the virus, tracers will text, email or call you and ask you to log on to theNHS Test and Trace,externalwebsite to provide details of contacts. Close contacts will then be contacted and told to stay at home for 14 days, even if they don't have symptoms. This process is organised slightly differently around the UK. This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? In Scotland, the system is calledNHS Test and Protect,external. Between 28 May and 7 June 2020, 741 contacts were traced from 681 positive tests for the virus - an average of 1.5 contacts per case. Northern Irelandwas the first part of the UK to bring in contact tracing. Contact tracing started inWaleson 1 June and is called 'test, trace, protect'. An app designed to help trace contacts in England - and possibly other parts of the UK -has been delayed after trials were carried out on the Isle of Wight. Mr Hancock said the contact-tracing app would be brought in ""when it's right to do so"". SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

"The development site is opposite Neyland on the Cleddau Estuary between Hobbs Point and the ferry terminal An investment company has pulled out of a Â£100m waterfront development in Pembrokeshire. Conygar's annual report,external, released on Wednesday, said it had decided to withdraw from the Martello Quays scheme in Pembroke Dock and write off its Â£4.8m investment. The original Â£8m estimate of constructing the marina had risen to over Â£17m, which made it ""not viable"". Conygar said it was a ""difficult"" but ""necessary"" decision. Planning permissionwas granted in 2008,external. It included consent for pontoons with up to 260 berths, 450 houses and apartments, a hotel, cinema, gallery, pub and restaurants. The report said: ""Having commissioned a detailed feasibility study, the results unfortunately concluded that the cost of constructing the marina would be considerably greater than our first investigation showed."" Conygar was appointed as the developer by a client group made up of Pembrokeshire council, the Welsh Government, the Crown Estate and Milford Haven Port Authority. Its contract was dependent on the marina being built by 2022. Conygar said the land-based element at Pembroke Dock was still viable, and ""substantial retailers"" had been attracted which would ""improve the environment and create considerable employment."" But an attempt to separate the land development from the marina was refused which led to the decision to write off the total investment. A joint statement from Conygar chairman Nigel Hamway and chief executive Robert Ware said: ""This was a difficult decision but we felt that it was necessary given the problems we have faced at this site over the past year."" Pembroke Dock county councillor Brian Hall said the development would have been a ""huge asset"" for the town, but he understood it was no longer viable for Conygar. He said major companies had shown interest in coming, which would have created 600 full and part-time jobs.

Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible.

However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate.

"Cardiff docks handles almost two million tonnes of goods a year Welsh ports should be granted free port status after the UK leaves the European Union, industry figures have argued. That would mean goods imported and turned into higher value products inside free ports would not face tax and duties until they left the zone. It is hoped this would attract more international business into ports and encourage manufacturing. The Welsh Government said it has ""an open mind"", while the UK government wants to maximise trade opportunities. The idea of free ports was floated in evidence to an assembly committee's inquiry into Brexit's impact on ports, and Economy Secretary Ken Skates has said it is worth investigating. But campaigners need to win the support of HM Revenue and Customs. Fishing industry wants free port status for Grimsby Brexit: The key issues Holyhead: Fast food and ferries wait on Brexit Ports fear over 'hard' Brexit The United States has more than 250 free trade zones, employing 420,000 people. It has been claimed more than half of Britain's major ports - including Port Talbot, Newport and Holyhead - are in poorer areas andthe Centre for Policy Studies said free ports could create as many as 86,000 jobs if successful.,external This video can not be played Would a free port help Pembrokeshire's economy? Stewart Graves, is managing director of Mainstay Marine Solutions in Pembroke Dock, which is currently building two new Welsh fishery protection vessels. The company employs 90 people, 10% of which are apprentices. He said the Pembrokeshire economy had seen decline after the loss of refinery jobs and now worries about the impact of Brexit. ""The real problem is there aren't any sustainable jobs in terms of manufacturing in the area,"" he said. ""That's what really needs to be rectified. Good quality employment - that's really what's missing."" He worries about tariffs on local industry but hopes a free port might act as stimulus. ""If Brexit doesn't come across on a frictionless basis then we are going to be in a situation where to attract the right quality of jobs to Pembrokeshire, we're going to require something like a free port to ensure tariff-free trade can go on,"" he added. Alec Don, chief executive of the port of Milford Haven said free ports were of great interest and could have potential for different ports in Wales, each with different markets. ""Being able to create a place where every movement of a good isn't attached with bureaucracy and tariffs but also where the decision to invest - build a new fabrication hall or buy a new piece of plant - is something you can do quickly, at the pace the market wants it,"" he said. Dr Andrew Potter, a transport and logistics expert at Cardiff University, said free ports would create new jobs if more people used them. The challenge for Wales would be the competition between free ports - especially the likes of big container ports such as Liverpool, Felixstowe and Southampton - and they require good rail and road links, as well as infrastructure such as warehousing. They would also need the volume to justify investment and expansion. Dr Potter said it was not necessarily a magic wand for every industry, although it could help haulage and those involved in warehousing and storage. Extra customs checks could take place inland How Wales could help address global shortage of port pilots Cardiff Bay - what has 30 years of development achieved? The UK government said it was seeking arrangements to maximise trading opportunities for businesses. ""We will continue to engage with industry and will carefully consider the best way to deliver the greatest economic advantage to the UK,"" a spokesman said. The Welsh Government said it had ""an open mind"" on the potential for free trading zones post Brexit, but that the matter was not devolved. ""We welcome ideas from industry on how free trading zones could work in practice in Wales and stand ready to raise this issue with the UK government further down the line,"" a spokesman said.

"Conwy Castle is a key tourist attraction in north Wales Wales' tourism industry is on the ""brink of collapse"", say a group of Welsh tourism leaders demanding a reopening plan from the first minister. Official figures say Â£6.3bn was spent in Wales due to tourism in 2018 but attractions, shut in lockdown, say they have had ""no reopening information"". The Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions claim government ""inaction"" may lead to ""economic disaster"". Welsh Government said reopening tourism ""is at the forefront of our minds"". Tourism in Wales directly supports about 120,000 jobs - almost 10% of Wales' workforce - andcontributes 6% of all Gross Value Added to the Welsh economy,external. People in Wales can currently meet others from another household outdoors but are advised to travel no more than five miles as a ""rule of thumb"" because of the coronavirus pandemic. Could lockdown be eased to help tourism in July? Two households can meet outside from Monday Schools in Wales get reopening guidance But with most of Wales' attractions and tourism businesses closed since last autumn - through the winter and now the coronavirus lockdown - they want ""urgent clarity"". ""We now face the real and fragmenting prospect, because of your very restrictive and separate set of pandemic lockdown policies, of a 2020 summer season that may never happen,"" the WAVA statement read. ""The result would be catastrophic for the tourism industry in Wales. This video can not be played The National Botanic Garden of Wales is one of Wales' top attractions ""Whilst once being protective, the Welsh Government's policies are now, as we are in the middle of June, causing further damage unless there is urgent change."" The statement says Welsh Government is causing harm because of ""its continued stance of remaining closed for business and travel"" and the borders are ""effectively shut"". Thousands of workers in Wales on furlough Young hit hardest by lockdown financial squeeze Restaurants want a roadmap for reopening The group's new plea to Mark Drakeford follows what they claim was an answered letter to the first minister last month and warns ""the Welsh tourism industry is on the brink of collapse' and ""without a clear roadmap to reopening such as those published in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the government is causing harm"". The seaside attracts a half of all holiday visitors to Wales The letter is signed by more than 60 of Wales' top leisure industry bosses from a range of high profile tourist destinations including Folly Farm, Snowdon Mountain Railway, Zip World, National Showcaves Centre for Wales and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. ""This is now heading towards its obvious end result of businesses taking measures to limit their losses, even if this will cause long-term damage to the regional economy and local communities,"" the association statement continued. ""The reality is that many businesses are on the brink of collapse. The impact on direct and indirect jobs will be significant in both the immediate period but also for many years to come as the economic generators will be lost."" Tourism bosses say Wales' message that ""Wales is shut, don't come and don't plan on coming"" is the ""most incredibly damaging message"". ""Welsh tourism will be left behind not only in 2020 but for a number of years,"" added the statement. Folly Farm in Pembrokeshire is one of Wales' most visited tourist attractions ""We are supportive of the first minister's aim to protect the health of people in Wales however this aim must be in the wider context of the long-term health of individuals and the ability of the Welsh economy to recover. ""We have a major concern that a narrow focus on immediate matters will cause irreparable damage in the long term (and to future levels of investment) - this is a concern that has been addressed in other parts of the UK and Europe, and we see Wales at odds for no valid reason with these concerns."" The Welsh Government had previouslysaid it ""hopes to be able to say something positive""for the tourism industry when lockdown restrictions are reviewed in July, with 9 July a possible date for a decision. ""We don't want the sector to be in any doubt at all that the safe reopening of the tourism economy is at the forefront of our minds,"" said a Welsh Government spokesperson. ""We hear what businesses are saying and are acutely aware of the challenges they are facing but we have to be guided by the medical and scientific advice to ensure we only lift restrictions when they are safe to do so. ""It is also crucial the sector knows that together with other nations we are fiercely lobbying for additional financial support from the UK government.""

"This video can not be played Gen Mark Milley: "" I should not have been there"" The top US military officer says he was wrong to have joined President Donald Trump during his controversial walk to a damaged church near the White House. The 1 June event created ""a perception of the military involved in domestic politics"", Gen Mark Milley said. Mr Trump walked to the church and held up a Bible after a peaceful protest at the death of African American George Floyd was forcibly dispersed. The use of troops to tackle the protests has provoked fierce US debate. Mr Trump has regularly referred to ""law and order"", calling in the National Guard to the US capital, vowing to deploy the military to other cities and condemning violent protests. Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders Some of the mostly peaceful initial protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month did turn violent with looting in several cities. But since four police officers were charged in connection with the death, the protests have been more peaceful, spawning an international movement against police brutality and racial inequality. Video footage of the death in Minneapolis shows a white officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was speaking in a video for a National Defense University commencement ceremony. He said: ""I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. ""As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it."" Gen Milley (R) was on the walk with the president, as was Defence Secretary Mark Esper (C) Gen Milley added: ""We must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our republic."" He also said he was outraged at the ""senseless, brutal killing"" of George Floyd. Gen Milley said: ""The protests that have ensued not only speak to his killing but also to centuries of injustice toward African Americans."" The general was wearing battle uniform as he walked with the president and critics said this suggested his support for the deployment of the military against protesters. Defence Secretary Mark Esper was also on the walk and, although he has not said he was wrong to be there, suggested in a news conference that he thought the walk was for a different purpose of mingling with troops and inspecting damage. Senior officials told US media that Mr Trump had yelled at Mr Esper after the conference. Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York This is just the latest sign of growing friction between the White House and the military over how best to deal with the country's history of racism and the current movement for change. The incident, which Gen Milley now regrets, placed troops right in the middle of domestic politics and, no less, in an election year. Several former generals have come out publicly against Mr Trump's ""law and order"" approach to what is a human rights issue - equality for black Americans. The president's first defence secretary, retired general James Mattis, said he never dreamed that troops would be ordered to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens. But this statement from Gen Milley, given his position at the top of the US military, is a far rarer and more stunning public break from the president. A peaceful demonstration was cleared in Lafayette Square next to the White House with pepper spray and flash-bang grenades so that the president and his entourage could walk to St John's Episcopal Church. This video can not be played Trump mobilises the military and makes walk to the church With the dispersal still ongoing, Mr Trump spoke in the Rose Garden, calling on governors to use the National Guard to ""dominate the streets"" or he would ""deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump, who sees himself as a champion of evangelical and conservative voters, then walked to the church, the basement of which had been burned the previous day, and held up a Bible. A number of religious leaders criticised his actions. The presiding bishop of the the Episcopal Church, Michael Curry, accused Mr Trump of using the church for ""partisan political purposes"". This video can not be played The Minneapolis community at the heart of the protests is rebuilding after destruction caused by rioting Mr Trump said ""most religious leaders loved"" his visit to the church and denied having any role in dispersing protesters beforehand.

Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"Global stock markets have fallen amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases could cause more economic damage. The declines came after the US Federal Reserve warned that the American economy faces a long road to recovery. In the US on Thursday, the three main share indexes saw their worst day in weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7%. Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China. The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March. Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit. Earlier on Thursday, European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100, the Dax in Germany and France's CAC 40 all losing 4% or more. What is a recession? Fed warns US faces 'long road' to recovery UK economy virus hit among worst of leading nations ""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale. ""But the problem is there is a limit to governments injecting money."" Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus. Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs. But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said. US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise. Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days. ""It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,"" he said. ""It would not be a positive development."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not want to see a return of the lockdowns that had kept the world's largest economy frozen for weeks. But economists have warned that people will stay at home voluntarily if they are afraid of becoming ill.

The recommendations say:  The Department of Transport's advice remains that people should avoid non-essential travel. The guidelines have been criticised as ""nonsensical"" by the airline industry which has been hit hard by Covid-19 travel restrictions. Read the full story here. Russell HottenBBC Business Reporter Gary Hume silk tapestry from 1998, shown in a BA lounge at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 British Airways is selling some of its multi-million-pound art collection to raise cash to help it through the coronavirus pandemic. The collection includes pieces by Damien Hirst, Bridget Riley and Peter Doig, with one work believed to have been valued at more than Â£1m. It is understood at least 10 pieces have been identified for sale, although exactly which ones is unclear. BA - like many airlines - has seen a collapse in demand for air travel during the pandemic and is set to cut thousands of jobs. Last week, BA boss Alex Cruz warned that the cash-strapped airline's survival was at stake unless there was a drastic restructuring of the business. Other works in the collection include pieces by Tracey Emin, Anish Kapoor and Chris Ofili. The airline would not comment on the sale, nor identify which works would go under the hammer. Let's just recap on the test and trace scheme introduced by the UK's National Health Service to help lift lockdown measures and curb the spread of coronavirus.

The Rio de Paz group dug 100 symbolic ""graves"" A memorial to victims of the coronavirus in Brazil has been vandalised by supporters of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, activists say. Members of the Rio de Paz civil society group had dug 100 symbolic shallow graves in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach to represent those killed in the pandemic. Each grave was marked by a cross. Brazil has recorded more than 772,000 cases - the world's second-highest number - and nearly 40,000 deaths. Later, a group of people opposed to the tribute gathered nearby and mocked the activists. Rio de Paz said they were supporters of Bolsonaro. One of the group then began knocking down the crosses. Adding to the confusion, a passer-by who said his son had died from Covid-19 then began replacing the crosses. Mr Bolsonaro has opposed lockdown measures and downplayed the virus as ""a little flu"".

across Pakistan's most populous province, despite a rapidly rising number of coronavirus
cases. Lahore Deputy Commissioner Danish
Afzal told BBC Urdu that no-one suspected of having coronavirus was left in the

Lahore, along with others in different cities in Punjab. The move comes amid
concern as cases in Punjab and other parts of Pakistan are rapidly increasing after

open for under-16s during the pandemic did not lead to any major outbreaks of
Covid 19, according to the country's education minister. Anna Ekstrom said research by the Swedish Public Health
Agency  showed that Swedes working in education - including teachers,
daycare staff and teaching assistants - had not been more likely to be
diagnosed with coronavirus than those in other occupational groups. Schools for older pupils and
universities have been given the go-ahead to reopen from 15 June - but for summer schools and courses
only. Sweden is set to relax a number of
other national recommendations in the coming days. From Saturday, Swedes without any
Covid-19 symptoms can travel freely within the country. And on Sunday elite sports can start

"Boris Johnson will hold post-Brexit trade talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen via video link on Monday next week. The UK and EU have said no major progress has been made towards a deal after four rounds of talks this year. Both sides were due to decide by the end of June whether the current deadline for negotiating a deal should be extended beyond the end of December. On Friday, the UK formally confirmed it will not extend the transition period. Cabinet Office ministerMichael Gove said in a tweet,externalthat he had chaired a meeting with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic in which he said the ""moment for extension has now passed"". ""On 1 January 2021 we will take back control and regain our political and economic independence,"" he added. A UK government spokesman said both sides had also agreed an ""intensified"" schedule of weekly talks throughout the month of July. This will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings in London and Brussels, if coronavirus guidelines allow, he added.

But he said the government's policy on not extending the transition period - during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union - ""remains valid"". Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the Commons the UK will ""under no circumstances"" accept an extension to the transition period. He said the EU's Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier had indicated progress can be made on issues including fisheries and state aid. but some EU member states had been a ""little more reluctant"". ""I think it would be in everyone's interests, EU member states, the Commission, and of course the UK government, if Michel Barnier were able to use the flexibility that he has deployed in the past in order to secure an arrangement that would work in everyone's interests,"" he told MPs. It comes after Mr Barnier said there had been ""no significant areas of progress"" at last week's negotiating round. Likewise his UK counterpart Mr Frost said progress ""remains limited,"" and negotiators were ""reaching the limits"" of what could be achieved in formal talks. Differences between the two sides remain on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. Speaking after his meeting with Michael Gove, Maros Sefcovic said it would be ""extremely useful"" if the UK could provide technical clarifications on customs IT systems at Northern Ireland ports by the end of June. He added that he wanted to have ""the specialised committee meetings organised in the course of summer so we can, I would say, bring the momentum into these discussions"". He added: ""We can also proceed with important conclusions in early September because time is really pressing and the clock is ticking, and I think we need tangible results in that process.""

TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) has calculated,external, for the first time, the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on household spending. It found that a typical household in the UK normally spent an average of Â£182 a week on activities, such as travel, holidays and meals out, which have been mostly curtailed during the virus outbreak. Many households have been saving that money or using it to cover any loss of income - but there remains the need for about 53% of income to be spent on essentials, such as food and housing. For young people a greater proportion of their income goes on essentials than other groups. With little in savings and less chance to cut spending, the under-30s are likely to be hit the hardest if their income drops. Read more. Allow Twitter content?

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland As well as announcing asmall drop in the R numbertoday- essentially the rate at which the virus spreads - the first minister was adamant that the 2m distancing rule remains best for now. Prof Susan Michie, co-director of the Behavioural Sciences Policy Research Unit for England and Wales, agrees. ""The further away you are, the less risk it is,"" she states on BBC Radio Scotland. ""If it's less than 2m, there needs to be a very low rate of transmission and there needs to be a lot of other measures. Remember, we still have thousands of people catching this horrible disease every week."" However, Dr Mike Longeran, a senior statistician and epidemiologist at Dundee University, takes another view after compiling various studies, saying the rates of infection are ""pretty much the same"" for the different recommended distances. But Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, an expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, quickly points out thatsuper-spreadersare a serious problem and the evidence tells us the closer people were to the source, the quicker they were infected. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK would have been halvedif lockdown had been introduced a week earlier, is what Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government adviser, asserted yesterday. Do John Beattie's panel of experts agree on this one? Dr Mike Longeran gives an emphatic yes, adding that the number would have doubled if it had come a week later. Dr Christine Tait-Burkard says the UK had more time to react than most parts of Europe but didn't respond adequately, although she believes the high death rate is not simply down to not locking down fast enough, saying that the number of care home fatalities is a tragedy that could have been prevented. And Prof Susan Michie has already put her name to a letter calling for a public inquiry, saying we need more transparency. ""[The UK government] have not published what has informed their decision-making, so that everybody can judge for themselves,"" she said. ""To what extent are things being done for other political reasons? To what extent is it being done for scientific, evidence-based reasons?"" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Businesses on island communities may not be able to open while the 2m rule is in operation, the chairman of Visit Mull & Iona says. Colin Morrison says many will be ""pretty hopeful"" the distance can be reduced by 15 July, when the tourism sector has been given the go-ahead to reopen. The islands face the ""added issue"" of ferries, which may only be able to run at 20% capacity he adds. Elaine Tulloch of Destination Orkney says the provisional date has brought some comfort to the sector and they will be looking to work with transport operators in the coming weeks. The chief executive says the sector wanted to open in a way that is safe and part of a joined-up approach.

""Assuming it happens, it's not the panacea we need,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But it is all a step in the right direction and for that we are grateful."" Mr Leckie, who plans to open the restaurants on his premises, said he was waiting to hear more on PPE requirements for the sector, but thinks there will be a focus on face masks and screening.

"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic Cancer care in England has faced major disruption during the pandemic with big drops in numbers being seen following urgent referrals by GPs, figures show. The number of people being assessed by a cancer doctor after referral fell to 79,500 in April - a drop of 60% compared to the same month last year. Meanwhile, patients starting treatment dropped to 10,800 - 20% below 2019. The NHS said it had tried to protect services - and some of the impact was due to people not seeking treatment. NHS England said a number of innovative approaches were being introduced to keep cancer care running. This has included delivering more chemotherapy in the community and people's homes as well as creating ""Covid-free"" wings in hospital to protect patients. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said staff had gone to ""great lengths"" to deliver care. And he urged people to come forward for treatment amid concerns fear of the virus is deterring people from seeking help. Figures for elsewhere in the UK have not been published yet. Cancer patients are missing out on appointments and treatments during the epidemic Charities warned the disruption to services would have a devastating effect. As well as the drop in referrals and treatment starting, Cancer Research UKestimates that there will be a backlog of more than two million people waiting for screening across the UK. Thousands of patients have also seen their on-going treatment stopped. Baroness Delyth Morgan, of Breast Cancer Now, said her charity has been deluged with calls from people worried about not getting treatment. ""It is extremely concerning,"" she said. Lynda Thomas, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the pandemic had ""wreaked havoc"" on services. ""Many people with cancer are being left to wait for next steps in fear, worrying about the long-term implications for their health, their families and their future."" Joanne Addis has seen her treatment for breast cancer stopped Joanne Addis, 54, from Stockport, was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in 2017 only weeks after having surgery for primary breast cancer. She has been given a drug called palbociclib ever since to slow down the cancer, but her treatment had to be stopped in April because it left her susceptible to coronavirus. ""I wasn't happy. It has kept my cancer stable for three years. I try not to think what will happen. ""There are a lot of people like me who've had to pause their cancer treatment and not all of us will have good results at the end of this. ""I'm just hoping that the risk of coronavirus drops low enough soon so I can restart my treatment."" In England - and elsewhere in the UK for that matter - NHS bosses have sought new ways to deliver cancer care. ""Covid-free"" wings have been set up in hospitals to allow cancer patients to be treated. These have been organised by 21 cancer hubs in England with lead cancer hospitals helping to coordinate care. For example, in London this has been done by the Royal Marsden, Guy's and St Thomas' and University College London Hospitals. There has also been a focus on delivering care in the community and people's homes - with ""chemo-buses"" used in some places to allow staff to tour neighbourhoods providing chemotherapy from the back of an adapted van. A targeted form of radiotherapy has also been rolled out, which requires fewer courses of treatment meaning patients do not have to visit hospital so often. The figures published also include data for A&E and routine operations. Routine operations were cancelled en-masse during April to help free up space for the expected surge of coronavirus patients. Just 41,000 underwent surgery - down from 280,000 in April 2019. Routine work is now in the process of being re-started, although NHS bosses have said thewaiting list could more than double in size by the start of next yearas hospitals are struggling to get back to full capacity because of the strain of dealing with the pandemic. The A&E data is more recent - it covers the month of May. It shows 1.26m people visit A&E - down from 2.17m in May 2020. But it the numbers did represent an increase from just over 900,000 in April.

"Younger women have been hit financially by lockdown Young people have been hardest hit by a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials, official data suggests. The youngest and oldest workers are most likely to have lost their jobs or seen income cut owing to the system of state-paid wages. With little in savings and less chance to cut spending, the under-30s would be hit hardest by this, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Renters have found it just as tough. TheONS has calculated,external, for the first time, the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on household spending. It found that a typical household in the UK normally spent an average of Â£182 a week on activities, such as travel, holidays and meals out, that have been mostly ruled out under health guidance during the virus outbreak. This is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of Â£831. Many households have been saving that money instead or using it to cover any loss of income. Thousands of people have lost their jobs and millions have received only 80% of their usual wages as they have been furloughed - in other words, told not to work while the government covers their pay. The latest figures show more than 7.5 million people had been furloughed in the UK by the end of May, while another 2.5 million self-employed workers have applied for grants to cover their losses. While many people have saved, there remains the need for about 53% of income to be spent on essentials, such as food, rent, or the mortgage. Some, but not all of this can be deferred, through so-called payment holidays, particularly credit card bills, gas and electricity charges or mortgage repayments. However, young people, renters and people living in London have found a greater proportion of their income goes on essentials, some of which cannot be deferred, than other groups. As a result, they are likely to be hit the hardest if their income drops and they need to find the money for costs such as food and housing.

Read why history shows the young will be hardest hit The ONS said households renting their home from a landlord spent 61% of their usual weekly budget on essentials, compared with 52% for households which owned their home outright or with a mortgage. A typical 30-year-old spent 58% of their weekly budget on essentials and normally only 19% on what has been prevented during lockdown, such as drinks in a pub, the ONS said. On the other hand, older households of between 65 and 74 years old spent far less of their budget on essentials (43%) and considerably more (29%) on activities that have been unavailable. Six money-saving ideas for lockdown and beyond 'Under-25s and women financially worst-hit' In London, where property prices and rental costs are most expensive, a typical household spent 58% of its weekly budget on essentials such as food and housing costs, the highest of any region or country of the UK. ""For those who have faced an uphill battle during lockdown, it's a timely reminder of how much difference it can make to have something set aside for emergencies,"" said Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nobody is pretending it is easy to put money aside when you're starting out in your adult life, but it is worth doing whatever you can afford, as soon as you can afford to do so.""

"All 17 members of the Garg household Mukul Garg wasnât too worried when his 57-year-old uncle developed a fever on 24 April. Then, within 48 hours, two others in his family of 17 also became ill. The symptoms trickled in as expected - temperatures spiked and voices grew hoarse with coughing. Mr Garg initially chalked it up to seasonal flu, unwilling to admit it could be coronavirus. âFive or six people often fall sick together in this house, letâs not panic,â he told himself. Over the next few days, five more people in the house showed Covid-19 symptoms. And the pit in his stomach grew. Soon, the Garg family would become its own coronavirus cluster as 11 of its 17 members tested positive. âWe met nobody from the outside and no-one entered our house. But even then the coronavirus entered our home, and infected one member after the other,âMr Garg would later write in his blog,external, which has since attracted hundreds of comments from readers. The exhaustive account shows how the multi-generational family, a mainstay of Indian life, poses a unique challenge in the fight against Covid-19. How a market became Indiaâs latest Covid-19 cluster How Covid-19 changed the 'big fat Indian wedding' The country's stringent lockdown, which began on 25 March and lasted until this week, focused on keeping people at home, off its busy streets and out of packed public spaces. But in India - where 40% of households comprise many generations (often three or even four living together under one roof) - home is a crowded place. Itâs also vulnerable becauseresearch shows that the virus is more likely to spread indoors,external. âAll families under lockdown become clusters the moment someone is infected, that is almost a given,â says virologist Dr Jacob John. And, as the Gargs discovered, social distancing isnât possible within large families, especially during a lockdown when you are already cut off from the outside world. The Gargs live in a three-storey home in a packed neighbourhood in north-west Delhi. Mr Garg, 33, his wife, 30, and their two children, aged six and two, live on the top floor, along with his parents and grandparents. On the two floors below them live his uncles - his fatherâs brothers - and their families. Members range from a four-month-old baby to a bedridden grandfather of 90. Mr Garg's uncle may have caught the virus from a vegetable vendor Contrary to cramped joint family homes where many people share a room and a bathroom, the Garg home is spacious. Each floor is about 250 square metres, roughly the size of a doubles tennis court, with three bedrooms, en suite bathrooms and a kitchen. And yet, the virus spread quickly, travelling across floors and infecting almost all the adults in the house. They identified patient zero - Mr Gargâs uncle - but the family is still not sure how he caught the virus. âWe think it could be from a vegetable vendor or from someone at the grocery store because that was the only time anyone from the family stepped outside,â he says. But as the virus spread, fear and shame kept them from getting tested. âWe were 17 of us, but we felt so alone. We worried that if something happened to us, would anyone even come to the funeral because of the stigma associated with coronavirus?â But in the first week of May, when his 54-year-old aunt complained of breathlessness, the family rushed her to a hospital. And, Mr Garg says, they knew they all had to get tested. All of May was spent fighting the virus. Mr Garg says he would spend hours talking to doctors over the phone, while everyone checked in on each other on WhatsApp daily. âWe also kept changing the position of the members depending on symptoms, so no two people with high fever were in the same room.â Six of the 11 infected have co-morbidities - diabetes, heart disease and hypertension - which made them more vulnerable. âOvernight, our home became a Covid-19 healthcare centre with all of us taking turns to play nurse,â Mr Garg says Families are particularly vulnerable to widespread infection in a lockdown Virologists say large families are like any other cluster, except for the range in ages. âWhen you have a range of age groups sharing common spaces, the risk is disproportionately distributed, with the elderly at most risk,â says Dr Partho Sarothi Ray, a virologist. This weighed heavily on Mr Garg, who worried about his 90-year-old grandfather. But the virus, which continues to confound medical experts around the world, also held surprises for the Gargs. It wasnât unusual that he and his wife, both in their early 30s, were asymptomatic. But it was bewildering that his grandfather was also asymptomatic. And one member of the family, who had no comorbidities, was taken to hospital. The others showed typical symptoms. The families turned into 'zoo animals' by quarantine The 36-day fight to get one man to breathe Mr Garg says he wrote the blog because he wanted to reach out to people worried about seeking help. âIn the beginning, we cared so much about what people would think. And reading the comments, itâs so nice to see people saying it's ok if you get it, itâs not something to be ashamed of.â In the second week of May, symptoms began to vanish and the family watched as more and more negative tests rolled in, bringing relief. This was also when Mr Garg's aunt was discharged from hospital after testing negative. They finally felt like the worst was over. By the end of May - âthe month of the diseaseâ as Mr Garg called it - only three people, including him, were still positive. On 1 June, they got tested for the third time and the results came back negative. Indiaâs large families can be a source of support and care, but also friction and thorny property disputes. But at times like these they can also come to the rescue. âCan you imagine an elderly person in quarantine all by themselves with no-one to help? Despite the challenges, joint families benefit from the young taking care of the old,â Dr John says. Cases in India have sprinted past the 250,000-mark, spurring a debate over whetherthe pandemic could threaten extended families,external, as young people worry about carrying the infection home to older relatives. India re-opened this week after a strict lockdown âIt's a system that has survived hundreds of years of an onslaught of Western values and colonisation,â says Prof Kiran Lamba Jha, who teaches sociology at Kanpur's CSJM university. âCoronavirus is not going to destroy the joint family.â The Gargs would agree. Before the virus struck, the family was thriving. It was almost reminiscent of a 90s Bollywood flick, Mr Garg says. âAs a family, we had never spent so much time together than we did that first one month of the lockdown. It was also the happiest the family had ever been,"" he says, adding that it only made it harder to watch as one person after another fell sick. âWe saw each other at our best and worst but we came out of it stronger,â he says. âWeâre still cautious about reinfection but right now, weâre basking in the glory that we managed to beat this virus and come out on the other side.â How Covid-19 changed the 'big fat Indian wedding' How a market became Indiaâs latest Covid-19 cluster The families turned into 'zoo animals' by quarantine Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"More than 31,000 close contacts of people with coronavirus were identified during the first week of the test and trace system in England, figures show. Of those, 85% were reached and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. This was from 8,000 people testing positive for the virus. Two thirds of them gave details of close contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was the public's ""civic duty"" to follow instructions given by contact tracers. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he added he was not ruling out enforcement measures to make people self-isolate for 14 days if asked to do so. About 25,000 contact tracers were recruited in England and started work at the end of May. The NHS figures, which cover 28 May to 3 June, are the first to be released showing the progress of the contact tracing scheme. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, said the system was working well but it ""can, needs to and will get better"". The system has been unable to reach 15% of close contacts identified - 4,809 people - either because they were unavailable, their contact details were wrong or they did not respond to texts, emails or calls from contact tracers. Appearing alongside Mr Hancock at the briefing, Baroness Harding said that did not necessarily mean those people had not self-isolated, adding: ""Only a small minority don't want to self isolate and we need to understand why this is and what we can do to support them to stay at home."" She said earlier there had been ""good numbers of compliance"" with 26,985 contacts of positive cases identified, reached and asked to self-isolate.

In response to a question about potential enforcement to make more people co-operate with the scheme, Mr Hancock said: ""We're not ruling it out, but we don't think we need it at the moment."" He said the ""best way forward"" was to see an increase in the number of people being contacted. Contact tracers are told to try to contact people 10 times in a 24-hour period. Most of the people called in the first week were identified by local public health teams as part of investigations into outbreaks. This video can not be played An anonymous contact tracer told the BBC they'd only made one call and were ""paid to sit there"" As lockdown eases, and people start to return to work and go out to shops, it is expected the number of contacts people have will start to grow from a low starting point. In the first week of the test and trace scheme, contact was made with 5,407 people who tested positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide details of recent contacts. Their cases may also have been investigated as part of a local outbreak. Some 2,710 with positive tests were not reached, either because their contact details were not correct or they decided not to give out information about their contacts. The data from the test and trace system in England has been eagerly anticipated - after all, this system will be crucial in helping contain local outbreaks, enabling the country to ease out of lockdown. It is still early days, but how should we interpret these findings? Firstly, the system seems to be pretty good at reaching the contacts of people who have tested positive, if those positive cases engage with the contact tracers and provide details in the first place. The problem is a third of people who test positive are not providing details. This could be because the contact tracers are not as good as they should be at tracking those who do not engage with the online forms (the first point of call for the system). There have been suggestions that sufficient translation support is not always available, for example. But incorrect contact details being provided and people simply refusing to take calls - despite repeated attempts - are certainly factors too. The key to the success of the system will be both an efficient service and public engagement in taking calls and following the advice to self-isolate.

This video can not be played An anonymous contact tracer told the BBC they'd only made one call and were ""paid to sit there"" As lockdown eases, and people start to return to work and go out to shops, it is expected the number of contacts people have will start to grow from a low starting point. In the first week of the test and trace scheme, contact was made with 5,407 people who tested positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide details of recent contacts. Their cases may also have been investigated as part of a local outbreak. Some 2,710 with positive tests were not reached, either because their contact details were not correct or they decided not to give out information about their contacts. The data from the test and trace system in England has been eagerly anticipated - after all, this system will be crucial in helping contain local outbreaks, enabling the country to ease out of lockdown. It is still early days, but how should we interpret these findings? Firstly, the system seems to be pretty good at reaching the contacts of people who have tested positive, if those positive cases engage with the contact tracers and provide details in the first place. The problem is a third of people who test positive are not providing details. This could be because the contact tracers are not as good as they should be at tracking those who do not engage with the online forms (the first point of call for the system). There have been suggestions that sufficient translation support is not always available, for example. But incorrect contact details being provided and people simply refusing to take calls - despite repeated attempts - are certainly factors too. The key to the success of the system will be both an efficient service and public engagement in taking calls and following the advice to self-isolate. It's a way of controlling the spread of the virus by asking people who have tested positive for coronavirus to share information on who they have been in close contact with. It starts withgetting a test,externalif you havesymptoms,external. If you test positive for the virus, tracers will text, email or call you and ask you to log on to theNHS Test and Trace,externalwebsite to provide details of contacts. Close contacts will then be contacted and told to stay at home for 14 days, even if they don't have symptoms. This process is organised slightly differently around the UK. This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? In Scotland, the system is calledNHS Test and Protect,external. Between 28 May and 7 June 2020, 741 contacts were traced from 681 positive tests for the virus - an average of 1.5 contacts per case. Northern Irelandwas the first part of the UK to bring in contact tracing. Contact tracing started inWaleson 1 June and is called 'test, trace, protect'. An app designed to help trace contacts in England - and possibly other parts of the UK -has been delayed after trials were carried out on the Isle of Wight. Mr Hancock said the contact-tracing app would be brought in ""when it's right to do so"". SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows a male officer being pinned to the ground and kicked The home secretary and the Police Federation have condemned a video which shows an officer on the ground apparently being kicked. Video circulating on social media shows an officer struggling with a man in Frampton Park Road in Hackney, north London. The footage was branded ""sickening"" by Priti Patel, while the federation said: ""We are not society's punch bags."" Four people have since been arrested on suspicion of assault on police. They include a 13-year-old boy and three men, aged 20, 32 and 34. The officers, a man and a woman, suffered minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment, the Met Police said. A member of the public, who had claimed to have been assaulted, flagged down the police on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the Met said: ""As an officer attempted to speak with those involved, one of the men resisted and a struggle ensued. A number of other people became involved whilst the officer was on the ground."" An officer was filmed while he was pinned to the ground in Frampton Park Road Footage appears to show the officer trying to restrain a man but they then fall to the ground with the officer pinned underneath. Passers-by began filming and taking selfies as the officer and the suspect grappled. The female officer attempted to keep people away from the scene and also suffered injuries before more officers arrived and the first two arrests were made. Tom Symonds,BBC Home Affairs correspondent Two police officers, presumably awaiting backup, are having to fight for control, on a London pavement, surrounded by people, seemingly hostile. As is so often the case, phones came out of pockets as the incident developed, so the video doesn't show what happened in the minutes before. That is crucial since officers have to justify the force they use. Even before George Floyd's death, any number of controversial arrests in recent years have demonstrated that a single video posted on social media can transform the public's opinion of an incident, and therefore their views of the police. This investigation may be able to rely on the officer's own body-worn video cameras, increasingly vital in establishing the context. But more generally, figures show the number of reported assaults on police officers have been rising steadily since 2014. This, during a period when police numbers fell because of years of austerity.  Fewer officers on the streets means fewer officers to respond, when their colleagues get into difficulty. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: ""Yet again this starkly shows the dangers [officers] face and the bravery they show each and every day keeping Londoners safe. ""We are not society's punch bags. We have families we want to go home to at the end of every shift, but the dangers are stark and seemingly escalating."" Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurt 'I thought I need to stop him or he will kill me' Police officer attacked during pursuit Supt Martin Rolston said: ""This incident, which was captured on someone's mobile phone is truly shocking. ""My officers went to the assistance of a member of the public - who asked for their help - after stating that they had been assaulted. ""What happened next is a reminder of the risks our officers take whilst going about their duties."" Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: ""Sickening, shocking & disgraceful. ""My thoughts are with the outstanding officers who were subject to this disgusting violent attack."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I utterly condemn the disgraceful attack on two Metropolitan Police officers this afternoon. ""These brave officers were doing their duty and assisting the public.

"Younger women have been hit financially by lockdown Young people have been hardest hit by a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials, official data suggests. The youngest and oldest workers are most likely to have lost their jobs or seen income cut owing to the system of state-paid wages. With little in savings and less chance to cut spending, the under-30s would be hit hardest by this, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Renters have found it just as tough. TheONS has calculated,external, for the first time, the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on household spending. It found that a typical household in the UK normally spent an average of Â£182 a week on activities, such as travel, holidays and meals out, that have been mostly ruled out under health guidance during the virus outbreak. This is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of Â£831. Many households have been saving that money instead or using it to cover any loss of income. Thousands of people have lost their jobs and millions have received only 80% of their usual wages as they have been furloughed - in other words, told not to work while the government covers their pay. The latest figures show more than 7.5 million people had been furloughed in the UK by the end of May, while another 2.5 million self-employed workers have applied for grants to cover their losses. While many people have saved, there remains the need for about 53% of income to be spent on essentials, such as food, rent, or the mortgage. Some, but not all of this can be deferred, through so-called payment holidays, particularly credit card bills, gas and electricity charges or mortgage repayments. However, young people, renters and people living in London have found a greater proportion of their income goes on essentials, some of which cannot be deferred, than other groups. As a result, they are likely to be hit the hardest if their income drops and they need to find the money for costs such as food and housing. Jared Thomas has seen work fail to pick up Jared Thomas, 26, from south Wales, has seen work dry up as the coronavirus outbreak means financially stretched customers have had little demand for his tree surgery services. ""Everybody's life has been turned upside down,"" he says. ""I really don't know when work will pick up. I'd be surprised if it does for the next month or two."" He has claimed the universal credit benefit for the first time, so he can pay the rent. Read why history shows the young will be hardest hit The ONS said households renting their home from a landlord spent 61% of their usual weekly budget on essentials, compared with 52% for households which owned their home outright or with a mortgage. A typical 30-year-old spent 58% of their weekly budget on essentials and normally only 19% on what has been prevented during lockdown, such as drinks in a pub, the ONS said. On the other hand, older households of between 65 and 74 years old spent far less of their budget on essentials (43%) and considerably more (29%) on activities that have been unavailable. Six money-saving ideas for lockdown and beyond 'Under-25s and women financially worst-hit' In London, where property prices and rental costs are most expensive, a typical household spent 58% of its weekly budget on essentials such as food and housing costs, the highest of any region or country of the UK. ""For those who have faced an uphill battle during lockdown, it's a timely reminder of how much difference it can make to have something set aside for emergencies,"" said Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nobody is pretending it is easy to put money aside when you're starting out in your adult life, but it is worth doing whatever you can afford, as soon as you can afford to do so.""

"Conwy Castle is a key tourist attraction in north Wales Wales' tourism industry is on the ""brink of collapse"", say a group of Welsh tourism leaders demanding a reopening plan from the first minister. Official figures say Â£6.3bn was spent in Wales due to tourism in 2018 but attractions, shut in lockdown, say they have had ""no reopening information"". The Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions claim government ""inaction"" may lead to ""economic disaster"". Welsh Government said reopening tourism ""is at the forefront of our minds"". Tourism in Wales directly supports about 120,000 jobs - almost 10% of Wales' workforce - andcontributes 6% of all Gross Value Added to the Welsh economy,external.

Could lockdown be eased to help tourism in July? Two households can meet outside from Monday Schools in Wales get reopening guidance But with most of Wales' attractions and tourism businesses closed since last autumn - through the winter and now the coronavirus lockdown - they want ""urgent clarity"". ""We now face the real and fragmenting prospect, because of your very restrictive and separate set of pandemic lockdown policies, of a 2020 summer season that may never happen,"" the WAVA statement read. ""The result would be catastrophic for the tourism industry in Wales.

Thousands of workers in Wales on furlough Young hit hardest by lockdown financial squeeze Restaurants want a roadmap for reopening The group's new plea to Mark Drakeford follows what they claim was an answered letter to the first minister last month and warns ""the Welsh tourism industry is on the brink of collapse' and ""without a clear roadmap to reopening such as those published in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the government is causing harm"". The seaside attracts a half of all holiday visitors to Wales The letter is signed by more than 60 of Wales' top leisure industry bosses from a range of high profile tourist destinations including Folly Farm, Snowdon Mountain Railway, Zip World, National Showcaves Centre for Wales and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. ""This is now heading towards its obvious end result of businesses taking measures to limit their losses, even if this will cause long-term damage to the regional economy and local communities,"" the association statement continued. ""The reality is that many businesses are on the brink of collapse. The impact on direct and indirect jobs will be significant in both the immediate period but also for many years to come as the economic generators will be lost."" Tourism bosses say Wales' message that ""Wales is shut, don't come and don't plan on coming"" is the ""most incredibly damaging message"". ""Welsh tourism will be left behind not only in 2020 but for a number of years,"" added the statement. Folly Farm in Pembrokeshire is one of Wales' most visited tourist attractions ""We are supportive of the first minister's aim to protect the health of people in Wales however this aim must be in the wider context of the long-term health of individuals and the ability of the Welsh economy to recover.

The Welsh Government has said the safe reopening of tourist attractions ""is at the forefront of our minds"", after a letter from 60 major operators warned that the sector was on the ""brink of collapse"". Tourist attractions in Wales remain closed amid the coronavirus lockdown, with no information on when they can reopen. Having written a letter of warning back in May, the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions has written to the Welsh Government again, claiming inaction from it would lead to ""economic disaster"" for the country. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We hear what businesses are saying and are acutely aware of the challenges they are facing. ""But we have to be guided by the medical and scientific advice to ensure we only lift restrictions when they are safe to do so."" The spokesman added that the next point of review was on 18 June. However, Economy Minister Ken Skates indicated on Wednesday that  the review after that - on 9 July - could be the point when he could say ""something positive"". The chief executive of the Football Association of Wales has called on the Welsh Government
 to allow fans into football stadiums at a reduced capacity. Jonathan Ford told Senedd members that such a move would enable clubs to earn money when they return to playing competitive matches. The Cymru Premier season was curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic and no date has
 been set for the league to return as yet. He gave the example of Barry Town, who play at a 2,500-capacity stadium but ""would be delighted with 500 paying punters coming through the doorâ. âFive hundred people is a large gathering in a confined space, but in a large space with social distancing
 it arguably could be and should be permitted,â Mr Ford told the culture, Welsh language and communications committee. The chair of the Welsh Rugby Union says that the effect of coronavirus on its budget has
 been âcatastrophicâ. Gareth Davies told the Seneddâs culture, Welsh language and communications committee that
 the last-minute cancellation of the Wales v Scotland Six Nations match on 13 March cost the union Â£10m. Mr Davies added that the unionâs annual turnover was Â£90m. He had previously warned thatWelsh rugby would suffer financial ""pain""if games resumed behind closed doors without revenue from ticket sales and hospitality. Plans are in place to introduce social distancing as farmers' markets reopen in Cardiff. In a statement, Cardiff Farmers' Markets thanked customers for their support and announced return dates for markets. ""Weâre now at the stage
where the markets can return - but we need to make some changes in the interest
of safety,"" it said. ""As well as changes to
the market set-up, we will be putting social distancing measures in place to
create an environment which is safe for customers, traders and staff."" Markets will have one-way systems, strict opening hours, card-only payments and fewer stalls, focusing on offering ""a mix of essential food supplies"". Rhiwbina Market will be the first to reopen tomorrow from 10:00 to 13:00 BST.    Holiday park operators in Wales have come together to agree on a strict set of safety and hygiene measures in preparation for the possible reopening of parks in July. On Wednesday, Economy Minister Ken Skates indicated he hoped to be ""able to say something positive for the tourism industry""after a scheduled review of lockdown measureson 9 July. Between them the five operators - Parkdean Resorts, Away Resorts, Haven, Park Leisure and Haulfryn Group - run 19 parks. They are writing to MPs and members of the Senedd to stress how their parks can reopen safely, and to warn of the economic risk to the Welsh economy of any delay in reopening. The measures include floor markings to help social distancing, one-way systems, deep cleaning of caravans, hand sanitiser points and the continued closure of communal facilities including restaurants. Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the British Holiday and Home Parks Association and boss of Celtic Holiday Parks in Pembrokeshire, said the sector was ""the mainstay of the Welsh rural and coastal economy"". ""We and our customers support local jobs, from those in shops, garages and plumbers to pubs, restaurants and tourist attractions,"" he said. ""When the time is right, it is essential that our parks reopen and our customers return to safeguard those jobs.â Tourism leaders from 60 of the biggest tourist attractions in Wales have issued a second plea to First Minister Mark Drakeford for a roadmap for reopening. Tourist attractions in Wales remain closed, with no information about when they can reopen. The Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions said the industry is on the ""brink of collapse"" and inaction from Welsh Government will lead to ""economic disaster"" for the country. Tourism leaders from some of the most popular visitor attractions in Wales have issued a joint statement calling for urgent clarity around dates for reopening following the coronavirus lockdown. The new statement follows a previous letter sent to the first minister on 27 May. The second letter, signed by over 60 leisure industry bosses from a range of high profile tourist destinations, including Snowdon Mountain Railway, Zip World and the National Botanic Garden of Wales, warns the Welsh tourism industry warns that the absence of a roadmap to reopening is ""causing harm"". The Welsh Government ""hopes to be able to say something positive"" for the tourism industry when lockdown restrictions are reviewed in July, the economy minister has said. Ken Skates singled out 9 July as a possible date for that decision. The
coronavirus pandemic has âincredibly negatively impactedâ all sport in Wales
âfrom grassroots to the very topâ, a Senedd committee has heard. Brian
Davies, acting chief executive of Sport Wales, told the culture, Welsh language and communications committee that his organisation has had 633 applications for
emergency funding since the beginning of the pandemic. Although 280
applications have been successful, a further 280 have been rejected. The remainder
of applications are still being considered. Mr Davies

like home"" is perhaps not so heart-warming a thought these days. After
all, most of us have been locked down in our house or apartment for a very long
time. The
coronavirus pandemic will, however,do more than change the way
we might feel about our homes. It has the potential to have a huge impact on
property markets around the world. It
is fairly clear that with massive unemployment, wage cuts, business failures,
and job uncertainty, many people are likely to be cautious about making the
biggest investment of their lives - buying a home. Normally
that leads to falling house prices, and during the last recession and credit
crunch that is what we saw in the UK, US and many other countries. More than 1,000 people have gathered in Newport to march in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many carried placards bearing political slogans while others knelt on one knee - a protest against racism that stems from the US. The demonstrators marched from the civic centre toward the University of South Wales building on the banks of the River Usk. Drivers could be heard honking horns in support as they walked. More than 2,000 people in Wales have been given Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for breaking lockdown rules. Since they were introduced on 27 March, 2,282 FPNs were given out in Wales before 8 June. The National Police Chief's Council's statistics show that roughly 30 FPNs a day are issued in Wales, the highest of which was by Dyfed-Powys Police. Of the FPNs in Wales, 76% were issues to men and 62% were to individuals aged between 16 and 34. The total number of FPNs issued by each of Wales' police forces are: Six more people with coronavirus are reported to have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,425, according to Public Health Wales. This graph shows the number of deaths by the day they occurred, rather than the day they were announced. Six more people with coronavirus have died in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures, taking the total to 1,425. These are where laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of coronavirus, and mostly involve deaths in hospital. Five council areas of Wales - Ceredigion, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Pembrokeshire and Torfaen - reported no new positive tests. To date, 102,546 individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Wales, with 87,875 testing negative. Pride Cymru's Big Weekend will not go ahead in Cardiff as planned but will instead go virtual.

There were no new positive tests reported in five council areas of Wales in the latest set of figures. Brexit trade negotiations and Covid-19
are""two
perfect storms"", a Welsh Government minister has said. Lesley
Griffiths, who is responsible for rural affairs, said ""the window of
opportunity to secure a deal is getting very, very small"". The
UK is due to leave the EU without a trade deal unless an agreement can be found
before the end of the year. The
UK government says it wants to reach an agreement with the EU during 2020. On
Thursday, business leaders warned that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic
for British firms. Dame
Carolyn Fairbairn, from industry body, the CBI, told the BBC that any buffers
to cope with the additional cost and planning of an exit from the EU customs
union and single market without a deal had been exhausted by the Covid-19
pandemic. The number of patients being treated in critical care beds with coronavirus in Wales has fallen to its lowest number since 25 March. A total of 32 people are being treated on invasive ventilated beds - including in critical care - for coronavirus, according to the latest NHS Wales figures. There were 885 covid-related patients in hospital beds - this is lower than last week but still the equivalent of three large hospitals being filled with patients with the virus, according to the chief executive of NHS Wales. Dr Andrew Goodall said: ""The majority of people being treated in critical care now do not have coronavirus, which importantly shows more NHS work is taking place."" Meanwhile, the figures also show: NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the 19 field
hospitals established in Wales remain ""a contingency""
but discussions were being held with health boards about whether there was ""some other supportive role that could be played by those field hospitals
as well"". He said there was an
exercise underway ""to actually judge what capacity we need to retain""
to deal with any future further coronavirus peak. ""I think that just having a
field hospital staffed across Wales, when they're not required wouldn't make
sense,"" he said. Dr Goodall confirmed the temporary
hospitals, such as the Dragon's Heart Hospital, inside Cardiff's Principality
Stadium, had cost a total of around Â£160m to establish. ""That was an investment for
preparation, that was an investment under the principles of investing to save
lives and to protect the Welsh population, and obviously we will want to make
sure that we have some further opportunity to use those going forward,"" he
said. ""But those plans may adapt and
change."" Cardiff's Principality Stadium has been turned into the Dragon's Heart Hospital Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.95728564
"Mr Trump's campaign suspended rallies in March because of the coronavirus outbreak US President Donald Trump is to hold his first re-election campaign rally for several months in Tulsa, Oklahoma on the date that African Americans celebrate the end of slavery. The rally will take place on 19 June, known as ""Juneteenth"". The Trump campaign said his Republican Party was proud of its role in winning the Civil War and ending slavery. The news follows weeks of anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody. In 1921 the city of Tulsa was the site of one of the worst massacres of black people in US history. Mr Trump's rallies, seen as vital for energising his base, were suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak in March. He faces re-election in November but is lagging behind his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, in the polls. Correspondents say that while the virus remains a threat, Mr Trump's campaign considers that large crowds at the recent protests will make it harder for his opponents to criticise his rallies. 'Stop the pain', Floyd's brother tells US Congress The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Gone with the Wind removed from HBO Max Announcing the venue, Mr Trump alluded to the low rate of coronavirus infections in Oklahoma - at 7,500 cases one of the lowest in the country. ""We're going to be starting our rallies,"" he said. ""The first one... will be in Oklahoma, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Beautiful new venue, brand new and they're looking forward to it. They've done a great job with Covid, as you know, in the state of Oklahoma. He said further rallies would take place in Florida, Texas and Arizona, but he made no mention of what safety precautions would be taken and whether social distancing would be applied. Also on Wednesday,Mr Trump rejected calls to rename military bases named after Confederate generals, who fought for the legal right to enslave black people. Juneteenth is an annual commemoration of the end of slavery. While not a federal holiday, it is celebrated widely by African Americans. It celebrates the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to enslaved African Americans in Texas. Texas was the last state of the Confederacy - the slaveholding southern states that seceded, triggering the Civil War - to receive the proclamation, on 19 June 1865, months after the end of the war. What Trump states make of unrest Timeline of US police killings The location of the rally in Tulsa is also highly significant. In May and June 1921 a white mob attacked the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood, known as the ""Black Wall Street"", with guns and explosives - killing up to 300 people and destroying about 1,000 businesses and homes. One of the most prosperous black neighbourhoods in the US was attacked in Tulsa Defending the timing of the rally, Trump campaign aide Katrina Pearson said in a statement that ""the party of [Civil War victor Abraham] Lincoln, Republicans are proud of the history of Juneteenth"". She added that Mr Trump had ""built a record of success for black Americans"". Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called the date ""a meaningful day"" to Mr Trump. ""It's a day where he wants to share some of the progress that's been made as we look forward and more that needs to be done, especially as we're looking at police reform,"" she continued. But the Biden campaign criticised the decision, with senior aide Kamau Marshall calling Mr Trump a racist. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

California Senator Kamala Harris also condemned the timing, tweeting: ""This isn't just a wink to white supremacists - he's throwing them a welcome home party."" The death last month of Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, after a policeman knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has triggered weeks of protest and soul-searching about America's racist past. Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday that military bases named for Confederate generals ""have become part of a Great American heritage, a history of Winning, Victory and Freedom"". This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? Later White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the possibility of renaming those bases was ""an absolute non-starter"" for Mr Trump. Mr Trump's remarks follow reports that top military officials were open to changes amid nationwide soul-searching after the death of George Floyd. For many, symbols of the Confederacy evoke a racist past. Confederate monuments have been a frequent target for protesters following George Floyd's death. On Wednesday night a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, was brought down by protesters in Richmond, Virginia. Meanwhile, demonstrators in the nearby city of Portsmouth attacked a Confederate monument, tearing down four statues, according to local media reports.

"Nikki Pinnington and her son Cosmo ""I only do a part-time job but it gives me independence,"" Nikki Pinnington, 44, tells the BBC. ""Now I will have to rely on my husband for the first time in my life. It's unnerving."" Part-time hairdresser Nikki Pinnington has been furloughed since March and home-schooling her 11-year-old son Cosmo, while her husband - the family's main breadwinner - continues to work full time. However, she now fears she won't be able to go back to work if hairdressers as expected reopen in July due to a delay in English schools reopening. The government had promised that all pupils would be able to go back on 4 July,but scrapped the plan this weekbecause it feels schools aren't ready. ""I can't see how I'll feasibly go back to work,"" Nikki says. ""The summer clubs I would normally use aren't running and my grandparents and in-laws are in the high-risk category for coronavirus. ""Hairdressing is an incredibly close contact profession and my husband is an estate agent, so we would not feel confident putting them under that risk."" She thinks working mothers are getting a ""bad deal"" during lockdown, as they typically earn less than their husbands and, in a scenario such as hers, will usually be the first to sacrifice their jobs to look after the children. And she is not the only parent lamenting the government's decision. Since March, only essential workers have been able to access schooling for their children, meaning many parents have spent the last 11 weeks struggling to balance working from home and childcare. Many had hoped for a short break before the summer holidays began, but now the vast majority of pupils won't return until at least September. To add insult to injury, the usual summer holiday childcare options such as activity camps or relying on grandparents are still off-limits because of coronavirus. ""Extended school closures are likely to place further pressure on working parents and require employers to be flexible and creative in response,"" says Claire McCartney, senior inclusion adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development (CIPD). ""If parents aren't supported through this challenging time, there's a real risk of them dropping out of work altogether or reducing their hours."" Sally Jones and her daughter Kitty Sally Jones, 48, says she was ""devastated"" by the government's decision, having really struggled to work and home school her two daughters. The part-time university administrator currently handles the lion's share of childcare in the house as her husband works full time. As a result she says she feels ""stressed and exhausted"". ""I'm always distracted and don't feel I am really doing either my job or the home-schooling properly,"" Sally says. ""No one is asking how parents are getting on, it just tears you up. I feel we have been left to pick up the pieces and deal with this on our own."" Mums 'do most childcare and chores in lockdown' Many primary pupils not back until September Some warn the burden of childcare during extended school closures is falling disproportionately on women. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says mothers in different-sex couples are one-and-a half times more likely to have lost work than fathers during the pandemic. And according to CIPD research, 44% of women say their financial security has worsened, compared with 35% of men, since the lockdown began. Your employer has the right to expect that when you're working from home, you're actually working, not doing childcare. However, this is an exceptional situation and many employers are exercising common sense and flexibility to allow employees to reduce or vary their working hours to accommodate childcare needs. If your employer does not allow this, you can make a formal request for flexible working if you have worked for your employer for 26 weeks. But they could refuse if it would have a detrimental impact on their business. You are entitled to take four weeks of unpaid parental leave if you have worked for your employer for at least a year and your child is under 18 years old. You also have the right to take time off for dependants because of an unexpected breakdown in childcare arrangements, This typically lasts only a few days, but it may be able to last a lot longer in the current crisis if parents have no childcare options available. You can be put on furlough for childcare/caring reasons, but only if you were already furloughed on or before 10 June. However, parents returning from family-related leave (maternity or paternity for example) in the coming months can now be furloughed even after the 10 June cut-off date and the government may make other exceptions. From July, the government will also introducea ""flexible furlough"" scheme,external, allowing working parents to go part time to cover childcare and make up 80% of the lost income - but employers must consent. For more information, visit theWorking Families,externalwebsite. Gemma Rosenblatt, head of policy at the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women's rights, warns there is a risk of creating a ""two-tier workforce"". ""[We could see] parents and particularly mothers losing out on work because the childcare simply isn't there. It's not just schools - there are signs that huge numbers of nurseries and childminders are at risk of closing."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reversed his position on statutory maternity and paternity leave The government will introducea ""flexible furlough"" scheme in July,external, which should help some parents. It will enable employees to go part-time to look after their children while claiming 80% of the lost income, although employers must consent. The Treasury has also reversed its position on statutory maternity and paternity leave, allowing parents who return to work in the coming monthsto access the coronavirus job retention scheme (or furlough scheme).,external But the TUC wants the government to go further, by pledging to extend the flexible furlough scheme - which ends in October - until all children can go back to school. It is also calling for stronger flexible working laws to protect working parents permanently. UK workers have the right to ask their employers for flexible working hours, but TUC research suggests one in three requests is denied. ""Ministers have previously said they will make flexible working a default right for all workers from day one in the job, and they must now urgently make good on that promise,"" said general secretary Frances O'Grady. Employers are watching the situation closely. SAVING OUR NURSES:Go behind the scenes at A&E I MAY DESTROY YOU:The next must-see show in lockdown The Confederation of British Industry says getting children safely back to school will be critical to the UK's economic recovery after lockdown and to stopping children falling behind outside the classroom. However, it says public health must remain ""the number one priority"". A Treasury spokesman said: ""The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been extended until October, meaning that it will continue to support people as they move back into work and we get the UK economy up and running again. ""We will continue to look at ways that support people returning to work and have announced that critical workers will continue to receive 30 hours of free childcare even if their income falls due to coronavirus.""

"Dentists are only offering urgent treatment to patients during the coronavirus lockdown Concerns have been raised that routine dentistry such as fillings will not be available to patients until next year. Lowri Leeke, who runs a practice in Merthyr Tydfil, said that it was ""too long"", with holes in teeth getting ""bigger and worse"". Senior dentists across Wales want plans for allowing practices to offer more than just urgent care to be sped up. Wales' Chief Dental Officer Dr Colette Bridgman said she was taking a ""phased and careful approach"". Dental patients 'could lose teeth' 'Keep dentists from poorer areas' in Wales Ms Leeke and her colleagues at Deintyddfa Hapus (the Happy Dental Practice) in Troedyrhiw have gone from seeing 30 to 40 patients a day before coronavirus to ""nearly none at all"" now. ""It's been like this for 11 weeks - we can triage emergencies over the phone but the only treatment we're allowed to provide is extracting teeth, which not everyone wants but unfortunately there's no other option available for us,"" she said. Lowri Leeke believes patients will have to wait too long for routine help ""It's very strange times, very sad - we miss our patients and it's difficult to adapt to what's going to become the new norm. ""I think routine dentistry - just fillings - won't be available until January which is a long time for both patients and for us."" She said many patients have been waiting since February for treatment and may not be seen until next year, adding: ""We're used to wearing our visors, masks, gloves and scrubs and keeping everything sterile - I don't see why we can't start working as normal sooner than January."" She also predicted there would be a ""big financial impact"" for practices such as hers that see both NHS and private patients. ""We've got the NHS element that we're still being funded for, but the private element is 50% - a big chunk of my business income coming from private patients so I'm losing that,"" she added. Dentists have been told the timeline for reopening could change The British Dental Association said there was a ""great, growing demand"" for swifter action before 2021. Dr Bridgman said the Welsh Government was ""absolutely alive"" to the concerns of her colleagues and timelines would be kept under constant review. Under her plans,revealed in a letter to Welsh practices,external, a wider range of dental provision would return in three phases. Due to the threat from coronavirus, dentists have been prevented from carrying out all but essential treatment since 17 March, with patients requiring riskier aerosol-generating procedures  - such as high speed drilling - referred to urgent dental centres (UDCs) that have been set up across the country. The first phase - from July to September - would see more of a role for UDCs but with patients re-assessed in the practices they normally attend. The phased reopening is due to begin in July In the second phase - from October to December - practices would be allowed to address the backlog of need from patients who require regular dental work, as well as those who have had non-urgent treatment delayed or postponed. Only during the third phase - from January to March 2021 - would routine assessment and care be reinstated. Tom Bysouth, chairman of the Welsh General Dental Practice Committee at the BDA, said this was ""a great concern"" to some in the profession. ""It's important to reassure people that dentists have always been very good at cross-infection control,"" he said. ""There are very good, robust policies in place to make sure patients and the team are protected."" Routine appointments are particularly important, he added, for screening patients for a wide variety of conditions - including tooth decay, gum disease and mouth cancer. In England, dentists have been told they can start to reopen from 8 June - though arguably they are at a different starting point to Welsh practices who have been allowed to keep seeing some patients face-to-face throughout the coronavirus restrictions. Dr Bridgman said she felt Wales was ""further ahead"", adding: ""Dental practices are open and have been open, providing advice remotely.  They've also been open to consultation already and have seen 8,500 patients since March, with a further 2,500 seen in UDCs across Wales."" She stressed that the timelines she had set out were indicative, and were to allow dental practices the time to prepare. ""At any stage if the first minister announces further easement of the lockdown we'll take them forward and we'll allow more central services to come online,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Edward Colston's statue was removed early in the morning A statue of a slave trader that was thrown into a harbour by anti-racism protestors has been retrieved from the water. Black Lives Matter demonstrators tore down the statue of Edward Colston during a protest in Bristol on Sunday. Bristol City Council said it needed to be removed from the water because the city had a ""working harbour"". The statue will be taken to a secure location to be hosed down before becoming a museum exhibit. It was fished out at about 05:00 BST because the council ""didn't want anybody to get hurt if there was a crowd there or anyone looking"". ""We've had a diver down there who attached the ropes to crane it out of the water and take it away,"" Ray Barnett, head of collections and archives at Bristol City Council, said. ""The ropes that were tied around him, the spray paint added to him, is still there so we'll keep him like that."" Mr Barnett said the statue would be hosed down to remove the mud and ensure ""we preserve him as he was tipped into the dock, while the decision is made how to move on for there"". The statue of Edward Colston was pushed into the harbour after being toppled by protesters Avon and Somerset Police elected not to intervene when the statue was toppled, saying officers would have faced a violent confrontation. The monument has been a controversial fixture in the city, with repeated calls for it to be removed. Previously, Bristol's Mayor Marvin Rees said he ""felt no sense of loss"" at its removal. 'Why Colston's statue had to come down' 'It's all been built upon racist acts' 'Why I'm still fighting racism at 90' Olivette Otele, professor of the History of Slavery at the University of Bristol, said she hoped the statue would ""be studied and analysed and people will learn about this because it's still part of Bristol's history"". ""All these continents, Europe, America, Africa, Asia, these are intertwined histories. It's completely intertwined and mashed together and you can't really separate them,"" she said. Other organisations, including schools, that use the Colston name are now looking at changing their names following the protest. This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? Since the statue of Colston was toppled, calls have been made to remove others around the UK. The statue ofnoted slaveholder Robert Milliganwas removed from its place outside the Museum of London Docklands on Tuesday.

"The statue of Robert Baden-Powell is being removed for ""its protection"" A statue of the man who founded the Scouts movement is to be removed from Poole Quay amid fears it is on a ""target list for attack"". Following police information, the 12-year-old statue of Robert Baden-Powell is to be ""temporarily"" removed to protect it, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council said. The statue will have 24-hour security protection until it can be removed. Protesters gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue. Baden-Powell, who died aged 83 in 1941, has been criticised by campaigners who haveaccused him of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler. In a statement, BCP deputy leader Mark Howell said it had made the decision ""quickly"" following the listing of the statue on a website detailing potential targets for attacks. He said it would not be removed immediately as its foundations were deeper than first thought, but in the meantime it would be given 24-hour security protection. ""We know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powell's and the Scout movement's links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue. However, we feel it is responsible to protect it for future generations to enjoy and respect. He insisted any removal would be temporary and it would be returned ""as soon as the threat level subsides"". The authority previously said it recognised some aspects of Baden-Powell's life were considered ""less worthy of commemoration"" and it planned to involve all relevant communities and groups in discussions about its future. Former Bournemouth East Labour parliamentary candidate Corrie Drew, said: ""We can commemorate the positive work without commemorating the man."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she added: ""A quick look into his history shows that he was very open about his views against homosexuality and that he was a very open supporter of Hitler and of fascism and quite a strong, outspoken racist."" Meanwhile, an online petition to ""defend Poole's Lord Baden-Powell statue"" has received more than 15,000 signatures. Sir Robert Syms, Conservative MP for Poole,tweeted,externalthat he was ""opposed"" to the permanent removal of the statue. Writing on Twitter,,externalTobias Ellwood, Tory MP for Bournemouth East, said: ""Few historical figures comply with 21st C values. Simply expunging past connections from sight won't correct wrongs or help us better learn from our past."" The Tory MP for Bournemouth West, Conor Burns, alsotweeted,externalthat the removal was ""a huge error of judgment"" and urged authorities to ""put it back"".

""We appreciate the local council has a difficult decision taking into account the various opposing views held by members of the public,"" the force said. A spokesman for the Scout Association said it was ""resolute in its commitment to inclusion and diversity and members continually reflect and challenge ourselves in how we live our values"". ""We look forward to discussing this matter with the council to make an informed decision on what happens next,"" he said. A group of local residents gathered at the quayside to protest at the planned removal A group of local residents gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue. Sharon Warne, 53, said controversial statues should have information panels installed explaining the positive and negative points about the figures they depict. ""He had a bad past but he was the founder of the Scouts which today is a great organisation and it's ridiculous to get rid of him,"" she added. Rover Scout Matthew Trott, 28, who travelled from Cwmbran in Wales, said the proposal to remove the statue was ""necessary to protect it"". ""I'd rather see the statue placed in a box in a warehouse for the moment rather than at the bottom of the harbour,"" he said. On Sunday, protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in Bristol tore down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colstonand dumped it in the city's harbour. A statue ofslaveholder Robert Milligan has also been removedfrom outside the Museum of London Docklands, while in Oxfordthousands of people called for the removalof a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Robert Baden-Powell (centre right) surrounded by the members of the Scouts movement Robert Baden Powell was born in London on 22 February 1857 He was in the Army where he specialised in scouting, map-making and reconnaissance, and trained the other soldiers in essential skills Returning home in 1903 he found the small handbook he had written for soldiers, Aids to Scouting, was being used by youth leaders and teachers He was asked by the Boys' Brigade group's founder Sir William Smith to devise a scheme to improve citizenship training for boys On 1 August 1907 he took 20 boys to Brownsea Island on an experimental camp which became the start of the Scouts movement He retired from the Army in 1910 to devote his life to the Scouts, travelling the world to inspire more young people to join scouting SAVING OUR NURSES:Go behind the scenes at A&E I MAY DESTROY YOU:The next must-see show in lockdown Torn down Colston statue pulled out of harbour University to rename Gladstone site after campaign 'Bit of hypocrisy' over Rhodes statue removal call London slavery statue removed from outside museum Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' BCP Council Scouts Account Manager - Label and packaging Dorset stuntman battles Tom Hardy in latest venom film Warning to Dorset firms over COVID loan repayments Passengers face delays after fault on train towards Bournemouth Police warn residents about scheduled protest in Bournemouth Small Animal Surgeon - Dorset Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows a male officer being pinned to the ground and kicked The home secretary and the Police Federation have condemned a video which shows an officer on the ground apparently being kicked. Video circulating on social media shows an officer struggling with a man in Frampton Park Road in Hackney, north London. The footage was branded ""sickening"" by Priti Patel, while the federation said: ""We are not society's punch bags."" Four people have since been arrested on suspicion of assault on police. They include a 13-year-old boy and three men, aged 20, 32 and 34. The officers, a man and a woman, suffered minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment, the Met Police said. A member of the public, who had claimed to have been assaulted, flagged down the police on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the Met said: ""As an officer attempted to speak with those involved, one of the men resisted and a struggle ensued. A number of other people became involved whilst the officer was on the ground."" An officer was filmed while he was pinned to the ground in Frampton Park Road Footage appears to show the officer trying to restrain a man but they then fall to the ground with the officer pinned underneath. Passers-by began filming and taking selfies as the officer and the suspect grappled. The female officer attempted to keep people away from the scene and also suffered injuries before more officers arrived and the first two arrests were made. Tom Symonds,BBC Home Affairs correspondent Two police officers, presumably awaiting backup, are having to fight for control, on a London pavement, surrounded by people, seemingly hostile. As is so often the case, phones came out of pockets as the incident developed, so the video doesn't show what happened in the minutes before. That is crucial since officers have to justify the force they use. Even before George Floyd's death, any number of controversial arrests in recent years have demonstrated that a single video posted on social media can transform the public's opinion of an incident, and therefore their views of the police. This investigation may be able to rely on the officer's own body-worn video cameras, increasingly vital in establishing the context. But more generally, figures show the number of reported assaults on police officers have been rising steadily since 2014. This, during a period when police numbers fell because of years of austerity.  Fewer officers on the streets means fewer officers to respond, when their colleagues get into difficulty. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: ""Yet again this starkly shows the dangers [officers] face and the bravery they show each and every day keeping Londoners safe. ""We are not society's punch bags. We have families we want to go home to at the end of every shift, but the dangers are stark and seemingly escalating."" Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurt 'I thought I need to stop him or he will kill me' Police officer attacked during pursuit Supt Martin Rolston said: ""This incident, which was captured on someone's mobile phone is truly shocking. ""My officers went to the assistance of a member of the public - who asked for their help - after stating that they had been assaulted. ""What happened next is a reminder of the risks our officers take whilst going about their duties."" Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: ""Sickening, shocking & disgraceful. ""My thoughts are with the outstanding officers who were subject to this disgusting violent attack."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I utterly condemn the disgraceful attack on two Metropolitan Police officers this afternoon. ""These brave officers were doing their duty and assisting the public.

"Concerns about the risks of deploying a go-it-alone UK coronavirus contact-tracing app are causing further delays. A second version of the smartphone software was due to have begun testing on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, but the government decided to postpone the trial. Ministers are considering switching the app over to tech developed by Apple and Google. But countries testing that model are experiencing issues of their own. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said the NHS Covid-19 app was to be launched across England - and possibly other parts of the UK - by 1 June. But he subsequently said the government had decided it would be better to establish a network of human contact tracers first. However, the BBC has discovered that one of the main reasons the initiative is running behind schedule is that developers are having problems using Bluetooth as a means to estimate distance. Even so, they still believe they are better placed to tackle the challenge than counterparts overseas who are working under constraints imposed by the two US tech firms. Contact-tracing apps are designed to prevent a second wave of infections by keeping a log of when two people are in close proximity to each other and for how long. If one of the users later tests positive for the disease, the records are used to determine how likely it is they infected the other. If required, an alert is triggered to help prevent the further spread of the virus. The UK has adopted what is known as a ""centralised"" approach, meaning that the contact-matching process is carried out on a remote computer server. One benefit is it offers epidemiologists more data to tackle the pandemic. France and India are other countries to have adopted this model. By contrast, Apple and Google's ""decentralised"" approach carries out the matches on the handsets themselves, on the grounds this better protects users' privacy. Poland switched its app from a centralised to decentralised approach on Tuesday. Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Latvia are among others to have adopted the tech giants' design. Both systems rely on Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to work. Number 10 is concerned that iPhones will not always detect each other because of a restriction Apple has imposed on apps that do not adopt its model. But the UK team has devised a workaround and is more concerned about other limitations of using Bluetooth. Some of these issues were outlined in a studypublished by Trinity College Dublin last month,external. It highlighted problems with using received Bluetooth signal strength as a means to estimate distance. Researchers warned signal strength ""can vary substantially"" depending on: how deeply a handset is placed in a bag whether the signal has to pass through a human body to reach the other phone if the two people are walking side-by-side or one behind the other if the devices are indoors rather than outdoors whether the smartphone is surrounded by metal objects The report highlighted troubling results when Singapore's TraceTogether app was tested. Ireland's police force is among organisations trialling a contact-tracing app ahead of a planned national rollout An experiment within a stationary train carriage found that when users moved from a distance of 3.5m (11.5ft) to 4m, signals became stronger rather than weaker because of the way metal objects were reflecting the radio waves. A trial in a supermarket also found the received signal strength was the same whether two people were walking close together or 2m apart. Follow-up tests using Apple-Google's tech are currently under way. ""The work is ongoing, but preliminary results are broadly consistent with previous observations,"" said Dr Brendan Jennings, who has been tasked with assessing the effectiveness of Ireland's Covid-19 app. The team behind Switzerland's SwissCovid app is carrying out tests of its own. Its Bluetooth measurement chief believes the issue can be partly addressed by taking a range of readings over a period of five minutes or more. But he added that Apple and Google had placed curbs on what could be achieved. ""The Google and Apple API [application programming interface] limits the amount of raw information that is actually exposed to the app,"" Prof Mathias Payer told the BBC. ""For maximum utility, we would get all the different measurements, but this has privacy implications."" Swiss MPs have given permission for the country's contact-tracing app to be launched nationwide Apps using Google and Apple's tech do not get to see the actual signal strength but rather one of three values, based on calculations used to normalise the different ways Bluetooth behaves on different handsets, By contrast, the UK team can currently obtain the measurements directly. Those responsible believe a further advantage of their centralised approach is that the data can be processed on the server involved, since it would be too taxing a task to be done on smartphones. But part of their challenge is communicating this to Baroness Dido Harding -  who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - and 10 Downing Street itself. A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment. Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app?

"More than 31,000 close contacts of people with coronavirus were identified during the first week of the test and trace system in England, figures show. Of those, 85% were reached and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. This was from 8,000 people testing positive for the virus. Two thirds of them gave details of close contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was the public's ""civic duty"" to follow instructions given by contact tracers. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he added he was not ruling out enforcement measures to make people self-isolate for 14 days if asked to do so. About 25,000 contact tracers were recruited in England and started work at the end of May. The NHS figures, which cover 28 May to 3 June, are the first to be released showing the progress of the contact tracing scheme. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, said the system was working well but it ""can, needs to and will get better"". The system has been unable to reach 15% of close contacts identified - 4,809 people - either because they were unavailable, their contact details were wrong or they did not respond to texts, emails or calls from contact tracers. Appearing alongside Mr Hancock at the briefing, Baroness Harding said that did not necessarily mean those people had not self-isolated, adding: ""Only a small minority don't want to self isolate and we need to understand why this is and what we can do to support them to stay at home."" She said earlier there had been ""good numbers of compliance"" with 26,985 contacts of positive cases identified, reached and asked to self-isolate. This video can not be played Baroness Dido Harding: 'We are overstating those actively ignoring self-isolation advice' One contact tracer, Josie, has been working from her home in Redcar, North Yorkshire, to trace contacts. ""Everybody that I've spoke to has been more than happy to share the information that we need,"" she told the BBC. Baroness Harding added the ""number one thing"" that would improve the programme was more people getting tested for the virus once they develop symptoms. How does contact tracing work in England? Coronavirus contact tracing: My new skill Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app? Appealing to people to comply with the measures, Mr Hancock said: ""Please do it to protect your loved ones, do it to protect your community, do it to protect the nation and do it to protect the NHS."" In response to a question about potential enforcement to make more people co-operate with the scheme, Mr Hancock said: ""We're not ruling it out, but we don't think we need it at the moment."" He said the ""best way forward"" was to see an increase in the number of people being contacted. Contact tracers are told to try to contact people 10 times in a 24-hour period. Most of the people called in the first week were identified by local public health teams as part of investigations into outbreaks. This video can not be played An anonymous contact tracer told the BBC they'd only made one call and were ""paid to sit there"" As lockdown eases, and people start to return to work and go out to shops, it is expected the number of contacts people have will start to grow from a low starting point. In the first week of the test and trace scheme, contact was made with 5,407 people who tested positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide details of recent contacts. Their cases may also have been investigated as part of a local outbreak. Some 2,710 with positive tests were not reached, either because their contact details were not correct or they decided not to give out information about their contacts. The data from the test and trace system in England has been eagerly anticipated - after all, this system will be crucial in helping contain local outbreaks, enabling the country to ease out of lockdown. It is still early days, but how should we interpret these findings? Firstly, the system seems to be pretty good at reaching the contacts of people who have tested positive, if those positive cases engage with the contact tracers and provide details in the first place. The problem is a third of people who test positive are not providing details. This could be because the contact tracers are not as good as they should be at tracking those who do not engage with the online forms (the first point of call for the system). There have been suggestions that sufficient translation support is not always available, for example. But incorrect contact details being provided and people simply refusing to take calls - despite repeated attempts - are certainly factors too. The key to the success of the system will be both an efficient service and public engagement in taking calls and following the advice to self-isolate. It's a way of controlling the spread of the virus by asking people who have tested positive for coronavirus to share information on who they have been in close contact with. It starts withgetting a test,externalif you havesymptoms,external. If you test positive for the virus, tracers will text, email or call you and ask you to log on to theNHS Test and Trace,externalwebsite to provide details of contacts. Close contacts will then be contacted and told to stay at home for 14 days, even if they don't have symptoms. This process is organised slightly differently around the UK. This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? In Scotland, the system is calledNHS Test and Protect,external. Between 28 May and 7 June 2020, 741 contacts were traced from 681 positive tests for the virus - an average of 1.5 contacts per case. Northern Irelandwas the first part of the UK to bring in contact tracing. Contact tracing started inWaleson 1 June and is called 'test, trace, protect'. An app designed to help trace contacts in England - and possibly other parts of the UK -has been delayed after trials were carried out on the Isle of Wight. Mr Hancock said the contact-tracing app would be brought in ""when it's right to do so"". SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

"Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't start another with a different household. If you decide to change your bubble, you should treat your previous bubble as a separate household for 10 days before forming a new one. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size and can include ""at risk"" peoplewho may be shielding. Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England'stest and trace programmemust stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. The governmentexpanded the eligibility,externalof support bubbles in England on 2 December to help families with very young children or people with continuous care needs. This means households can form a support bubble with another household, if at least one of them has: a child under 1 (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a child under 5 with a disability that requires continuous care (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a single adult carer (living with any additional adults in the household that have a disability and need continuous care) As well as the support bubble rules, the government in England also has a set of rules that apply to families with children under 14 (as well as to vulnerable adults). They can form a childcare bubble with one other household to provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households. Childcare can be provided in either or both of the two homes. During lockdown,registered childcare and childcare bubbles can continue.,external Two single people each living alone can bubble Someone in a houseshare could bubble - but their housemates wouldn't be allowed to form their own bubbles with other people Full government guidelinesfor England are here.,external In Wales, during lockdown, you must not visit other households, or meet other people you do not live with, unless they are in yoursupport bubble,external. Support bubbles can be formed by: households where one adult lives alone households where one adult lives with any number of children under 18, or households where more than one adult lives, but one adult has caring responsibilities for all of the other adults in the home People in the same bubble can stay in each other's homes overnight. And they can meet up in groups in some other outdoor places. If you were part of a temporary extended household during the firebreak period, or were in one before that, you can make a new bubble, instead. However, once you have agreed and joined that new extended household, neither household can leave to form a new one. Under the five tier system in Scotland,external, people who live on their own or only with children under 18 can form an extended household with people from one other household. People in extended households are counted as one household, and so can continue to meet and socialise with each other despite general restrictions on households mixing, and can stay overnight in each other's homes. Couples who do not live together can also form an extended household, which can include any children they each live with. A household must not form an extended household with more than one other. However, one of them can end the arrangement at any time, and - as long as they wait at least 14 days - then form a new extended household with someone else. If any member of an extended household develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Two households of any size can form a support bubble. The members can spend time indoors and stay overnight with each other. Under the latest restrictions, these bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people, including children, at any one time. Read more fromthe Northern Ireland Executive here.,external Before the latest lockdown, schools across the UK have been usingyear group and/or class bubblesto support social distancing and reduce close contact between pupils as much as possible.

"A statue of Christopher Columbus was toppled by protesters in St Paul, Minnesota Statues of Confederate leaders and the explorer Christopher Columbus have been torn down in the US, as pressure grows on authorities to remove monuments connected to slavery and colonialism. A statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was toppled in Richmond, Virginia, on Wednesday night. Statues of Columbus in Boston, Miami and Virginia have been vandalised. The movement has been sparked by the death in police custody of African American George Floyd. His death in Minneapolis has led to protests in the US and internationally against police brutality and racial inequality. Scouts founder statue to be removed Trump to restart rallies on key slavery date The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Memorials to the Confederacy, a group of southern states that fought to keep black people as slaves in the American Civil War of 1861-65, have been among those targeted. A number of Confederate statues on Monument Avenue in Richmond have been marked with graffiti during the protests. Richmond also saw a statue of Italian explorer Columbus pulled down, set alight and thrown into a lake earlier this week,. A three-metre tall (10ft) bronze statue of Columbus was toppled in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on Wednesday. The Columbus statue in Boston, which stands on a plinth at the heart of town, was beheaded. A city employee inspects the decapitated statue of Christopher Columbus in Boston Many people in the US celebrate the memory of Columbus, who in school textbooks is credited with discovering ""the New World"", the Americas, in the 15th Century. But Native American activists have long objected to honouring Columbus, saying that his expeditions to the Americas led to the colonisation and genocide of their ancestors. BLM - denoting Black Lives Matter - was sprayed on a Columbus statue in Miami The death of Mr Floyd, whose neck was kneeled on by a police officer for nearly nine minutes, has spurred global protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement. Many cities and organisations have taken steps to remove Confederate symbols, which have long stirred controversy because of their association with racism.Â Videos show crowds cheering as a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was towed away in Richmond Last week, for example,Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam announced that a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee would be removed from Richmond. However, a judge has since granted a temporary injunction stopping the removal. Stock-car racing organisers Nascar announced on Wednesday it was banning Confederate flags, frequently seen at races. US President Donald Trump has meanwhile rejected calls to rename military bases named after Confederate generals, saying they remain part of America's heritage. Seven solutions to US police problems What Trump states make of unrest Why US protests are so powerful this time He tweeted: ""The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"JK Rowling has said she spoke out about transgender issues in part due to her personal experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault. The Harry Potter author addressed criticism of her response to an article that described ""people who menstruate"". In alengthy blog,external, she wrote her interest in trans issues stemmed from being a survivor of abuse and having concerns around single-sex spaces. Actor Daniel Radcliffe was among those critical of Ms Rowling's comments. In the blog post published on Wednesday, Rowling, 54, detailed what she said were the five reasons why she felt the need to talk about the issue. These included her interest in ""both education and safeguarding"" and ""freedom of speech"". Explaining her final reason, she wrote: ""I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor. School renames Rowling house over trans tweets ""This isn't because I'm ashamed those things happened to me, but because they're traumatic to revisit and remember. ""I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. I didn't want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too. ""However, a short while ago, I asked her how she'd feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life and she encouraged me to go ahead. ""I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces."" Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter film series, and Eddie Redmayne, who leads the cast of the Fantastic Beasts movies,have both criticised Rowlingfor her comments about transgender issues. Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Potter franchise,said,external: ""Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are."" Eddie Redmayne has played Newt Scamander in two Fantastic Beasts films so far The row began last weekend, after Rowling responded to a headline on an online article discussing ""people who menstruate"" by writing in a tweet: ""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?"" Critics accused her of being transphobic, but Rowling said she stood by her comments, saying it ""isn't hate to speak the truth"".

In December last year, the author voiced her support for a researcher who was sacked after tweeting that transgender people cannot change their biological sex. In the blog post on Wednesday, Rowling said she was motivated to address transgender issues through her Twitter account because of what she sees as an increasingly misogynistic society. ""We're living through the most misogynistic period I've experienced,"" she continued. ""Back in the 80s, I imagined that my future daughters, should I have any, would have it far better than I ever did, but between the backlash against feminism and a porn-saturated online culture, I believe things have got significantly worse for girls. ""Never have I seen women denigrated and dehumanised to the extent they are now."" Dr Kathleen Stock, professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex, told BBC Radio 5 Live that JK Rowling is ""right to want to protect women-only spaces"". Allow Twitter content?

""For her to decide to use her incredible platform to be very critical and hateful towards a particular group of people, it just seems an irresponsible use of the platform by one of the most influential people in the world,"" he said. Some of the cast of Pose, a US TV drama series about New York's underground world of 1980s ballroom culture,told Variety,externalthe author's views were ""hurtful"".

"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic Cancer care in England has faced major disruption during the pandemic with big drops in numbers being seen following urgent referrals by GPs, figures show. The number of people being assessed by a cancer doctor after referral fell to 79,500 in April - a drop of 60% compared to the same month last year. Meanwhile, patients starting treatment dropped to 10,800 - 20% below 2019. The NHS said it had tried to protect services - and some of the impact was due to people not seeking treatment. NHS England said a number of innovative approaches were being introduced to keep cancer care running. This has included delivering more chemotherapy in the community and people's homes as well as creating ""Covid-free"" wings in hospital to protect patients. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said staff had gone to ""great lengths"" to deliver care. And he urged people to come forward for treatment amid concerns fear of the virus is deterring people from seeking help. Figures for elsewhere in the UK have not been published yet. Cancer patients are missing out on appointments and treatments during the epidemic Charities warned the disruption to services would have a devastating effect. As well as the drop in referrals and treatment starting, Cancer Research UKestimates that there will be a backlog of more than two million people waiting for screening across the UK. Thousands of patients have also seen their on-going treatment stopped. Baroness Delyth Morgan, of Breast Cancer Now, said her charity has been deluged with calls from people worried about not getting treatment. ""It is extremely concerning,"" she said. Lynda Thomas, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the pandemic had ""wreaked havoc"" on services. ""Many people with cancer are being left to wait for next steps in fear, worrying about the long-term implications for their health, their families and their future."" Joanne Addis has seen her treatment for breast cancer stopped Joanne Addis, 54, from Stockport, was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in 2017 only weeks after having surgery for primary breast cancer. She has been given a drug called palbociclib ever since to slow down the cancer, but her treatment had to be stopped in April because it left her susceptible to coronavirus. ""I wasn't happy. It has kept my cancer stable for three years. I try not to think what will happen. ""There are a lot of people like me who've had to pause their cancer treatment and not all of us will have good results at the end of this. ""I'm just hoping that the risk of coronavirus drops low enough soon so I can restart my treatment."" In England - and elsewhere in the UK for that matter - NHS bosses have sought new ways to deliver cancer care. ""Covid-free"" wings have been set up in hospitals to allow cancer patients to be treated. These have been organised by 21 cancer hubs in England with lead cancer hospitals helping to coordinate care. For example, in London this has been done by the Royal Marsden, Guy's and St Thomas' and University College London Hospitals. There has also been a focus on delivering care in the community and people's homes - with ""chemo-buses"" used in some places to allow staff to tour neighbourhoods providing chemotherapy from the back of an adapted van. A targeted form of radiotherapy has also been rolled out, which requires fewer courses of treatment meaning patients do not have to visit hospital so often. The figures published also include data for A&E and routine operations. Routine operations were cancelled en-masse during April to help free up space for the expected surge of coronavirus patients. Just 41,000 underwent surgery - down from 280,000 in April 2019. Routine work is now in the process of being re-started, although NHS bosses have said thewaiting list could more than double in size by the start of next yearas hospitals are struggling to get back to full capacity because of the strain of dealing with the pandemic. The A&E data is more recent - it covers the month of May. It shows 1.26m people visit A&E - down from 2.17m in May 2020. But it the numbers did represent an increase from just over 900,000 in April.

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows a male officer being pinned to the ground and kicked The home secretary and the Police Federation have condemned a video which shows an officer on the ground apparently being kicked. Video circulating on social media shows an officer struggling with a man in Frampton Park Road in Hackney, north London. The footage was branded ""sickening"" by Priti Patel, while the federation said: ""We are not society's punch bags."" Four people have since been arrested on suspicion of assault on police. They include a 13-year-old boy and three men, aged 20, 32 and 34. The officers, a man and a woman, suffered minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment, the Met Police said. A member of the public, who had claimed to have been assaulted, flagged down the police on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the Met said: ""As an officer attempted to speak with those involved, one of the men resisted and a struggle ensued. A number of other people became involved whilst the officer was on the ground."" An officer was filmed while he was pinned to the ground in Frampton Park Road Footage appears to show the officer trying to restrain a man but they then fall to the ground with the officer pinned underneath. Passers-by began filming and taking selfies as the officer and the suspect grappled. The female officer attempted to keep people away from the scene and also suffered injuries before more officers arrived and the first two arrests were made. Tom Symonds,BBC Home Affairs correspondent Two police officers, presumably awaiting backup, are having to fight for control, on a London pavement, surrounded by people, seemingly hostile. As is so often the case, phones came out of pockets as the incident developed, so the video doesn't show what happened in the minutes before. That is crucial since officers have to justify the force they use. Even before George Floyd's death, any number of controversial arrests in recent years have demonstrated that a single video posted on social media can transform the public's opinion of an incident, and therefore their views of the police. This investigation may be able to rely on the officer's own body-worn video cameras, increasingly vital in establishing the context. But more generally, figures show the number of reported assaults on police officers have been rising steadily since 2014. This, during a period when police numbers fell because of years of austerity.  Fewer officers on the streets means fewer officers to respond, when their colleagues get into difficulty. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: ""Yet again this starkly shows the dangers [officers] face and the bravery they show each and every day keeping Londoners safe. ""We are not society's punch bags. We have families we want to go home to at the end of every shift, but the dangers are stark and seemingly escalating."" Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurt 'I thought I need to stop him or he will kill me' Police officer attacked during pursuit Supt Martin Rolston said: ""This incident, which was captured on someone's mobile phone is truly shocking. ""My officers went to the assistance of a member of the public - who asked for their help - after stating that they had been assaulted. ""What happened next is a reminder of the risks our officers take whilst going about their duties."" Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: ""Sickening, shocking & disgraceful. ""My thoughts are with the outstanding officers who were subject to this disgusting violent attack."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I utterly condemn the disgraceful attack on two Metropolitan Police officers this afternoon. ""These brave officers were doing their duty and assisting the public.

"This video can not be played There are hurdles to overcome - Hearn on Fury v Joshua British world heavyweight champions Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have agreed to a two-fight deal, says promoter Eddie Hearn. Talks over a historic bout for the undisputed title began in early May. Joshua, 30, holds the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, while 31-year-old Fury is the WBC champion. ""We have a financial deal in place between the two of them for two fights in 2021"" Hearn, who is Joshua's promoter, told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It doesn't get any bigger. It's two British world heavyweight champions fighting for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world."" Fury expressed his delight at the news in a social media post. He said he would fight Joshua in 2021, but would first have to overcome the ""hurdle in the road"", Deontay Wilder, in a third meeting. Fury is contracted to fight the American, from whom he won the WBC title in February. Joshua, who reclaimed hisworld titles in December,has to face his mandatory challenger, Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev, when the sport fully resumes after the coronavirus shutdown. Hearn added: ""They do have intermediate fights. There is Dillian Whyte as a mandatory as well, but always the most difficult part of any deal is getting two parties to agree to the financial elements of the deal. ""The aim for Anthony Joshua is to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. He holds all the belts bar one, which is owned by Tyson Fury. So, if Tyson Fury was to lose to Deontay Wilder - which I can't see happening - then we would go straight into the Deontay Wilder fight for the undisputed championship. ""But, of course, in an ideal world you've got two Britons there who are heavyweight champions. It will never happen again, it has never happened previously and it's a chance for Britain to gain all the belts in the heavyweight division."" In a statement, Fury's promoter, Frank Warren, said ""no contracts have been signed"". ""Obviously, we are keen to make the fight that British fans demand and will continue negotiations in order to deliver Tyson his shot at becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world,"" he added. ""Things are going in the right direction and we couldn't be more happy that a potential mega fight is in reach."" Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Warren added: ""The only way it could not happen is if one of the guys gets beaten."" He added: ""Everyone wants it to happen. For me, this will be the biggest sporting event in this country with these fighters - four belts on the line, two Britons fighting for the world title, both champions. This is just mega. I think it'll be the biggest sporting event in this country since England won the World Cup in 1966. ""[Fury's] really happy. It's something he's wanted for a long, long time.

"Protesters have been calling for an Oxford college's statue of Cecil Rhodes to be removed In the row over the statue of Cecil Rhodes, Oxford University's head has warned against ""hiding our history"". Protesters want to pull down Oriel College's statue of the 19th century imperialist, saying it is a symbol of racism and imperialism. But vice-chancellor Louise Richardson said the views of the past had to be seen in the context of the time. ""We need to confront our past, we need to learn from it,"" said Prof Richardson. After theremoval of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristolattention has switched to other statues, including that of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford, commemorating the Victorian imperialist, businessman and funder of scholarships. The statue belongs to Oriel College, rather than the university, and Prof Richardson said she did not want to give a ""binary"" view on whether to remove it. But she gave no indication of backing protesters wanting to take down the statue, instead warning against trying to hide the past and calling for a recognition that views from the past needed to be judged in their historical context. Protesters call for Rhodes statue to be removed Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial character? How do you decide when a statue must fall? Oxford's MPs and a number of local councillors have supported calls to remove the Rhodes statue, arguing that it represented imperialist values that were no longer acceptable. The Rhodes Must Fall campaign has called for a ""public and permanent acknowledgement"" of the university's ""role in colonial violence"". Protesters in Oxford said the statue was no longer acceptable ""My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,"" Prof Richardson told the BBC. ""We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did,"" she said. ""This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? ""Personally, no - I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time,"" said Prof Richardson. In the era of Cecil Rhodes, support for imperialism had been the prevailing view, she said. Louise Richardson says that the views of the past need to be examined in the context of the time The vice-chancellor said that growing up in Ireland she had seen Oliver Cromwell as a ""barbarous"" figure - but she had seen his statue in Westminster and had learned more about him. ""Cromwell to me was like Voldemort is to my children,"" she said, referencing the evil wizard in the Harry Potter novels. ""But I went about learning more about how he was perceived very differently in Britain."" When looking at the attitudes and actions of the past, she asked: ""Do we use the ethics of today or do we use the morals and ethics of the time in which they lived?"" After a row about the statue a few years ago, there had been proposals for a plaque to be added to the Rhodes statue adding ""context"" about his life, and Prof Richardson said she regretted that this did not seem to have happened. But she said the focus of the university was not on statues from the past, but on the experience of students in the present, adding that the number of black and ethnic minority students had risen. This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? ""I would hate to think that any black student or student of any background would think that Oxford would be an unwelcoming place."" Prof Richardson was speaking as the university was about it announce its first new college for 30 years. Reuben College is to open next year as a postgraduate college and the vice-chancellor said it will be ""more problem-focused, more entrepreneurial"". The college will focus on climate change, artificial intelligence and cellular life. It takes it name from the Reuben family whose foundation has donated Â£80m to support it. ""The idea is to find solutions to global problems that transcend national borders,"" said Prof Richardson, adding that the college would have a more ""egalitarian"" approach than the ""traditional formal set-up"". Oxford University has been at forefront of efforts to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 and she said it showed the necessity of ""funding the research infrastructure"". ""It shows how important it is for a country like Britain to have as many first-rate research universities as possible. We're critical to the economic recovery,"" said Prof Richardson.

"British firms do not have the resilience to cope with a no-deal Brexit after the battering of the coronavirus crisis, according to the outgoing boss of industry body the CBI. Carolyn Fairbairn said a CBI member had likened a no-deal to ""setting the shed on fire"" while the house was in flames. Brexit trade negotiations have not been going well between the UK and the EU. A government spokesperson said the UK wanted to reach an agreement with the EU this year. Brexit trade deal: What are the sticking points? Brexit: Trade deal still possible with EU, says UK minister UK to start post-Brexit trade talks with Japan Dame Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC that any buffers to cope with the additional cost and planning of an exit from the EU customs union and single market without a deal had been exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The resilience of British business is absolutely on the floor,"" she said. ""Every penny of cash that had been stored up, all the stockpiles prepared have been run down. ""The firms that I speak to have not a spare moment to plan for a no trade deal Brexit at the end of the year - that is the common sense voice that needs to find its way into these negotiations."" Those negotiations are not going well. They broke up last week with the EU's chief negotiator saying that very little progress had been made on key sticking points, including future fishing rights in UK waters, and commitments to maintain a ""level playing field"" over regulation and competition. The devastating impact of Covid-19 and the fight for business survival has diverted management attention away from any Brexit contingency planning, according to Dame Carolyn, who worries that a political commitment to abandon the current transitional trading arrangements - come what may - will add to the burden on business at a critical moment. ""As one member put it to me - just because the house is on fire, it doesn't make it ok to set fire to the garden shed. ""If we have a political timescale that takes us to a brinksmanship deal in December that will be catastrophic for British business - they will not be ready. ""Small businesses were not ready last time there was a no-deal Brexit threat - this time they will not have had a moment to prepare for it."" Dame Carolyn's comments come as the CBI - the UK's most influential business group - confirmed she will be succeeded as director general by Tony Danker in November. Mr Danker is currently chief executive of Be the Business, an organisation set up to improve the efficiency and productivity of UK businesses. A former media executive, he was also a policy adviser to the Treasury. Relations between business groups and the government have been strained ever since the campaign leading up to the EU referendum of 2016, when business groups, including the CBI, warned of economic damage to the UK economy whose biggest customer is the EU. Dame Carolyn is hopeful that this crisis can help build bridges in the face of a common and deadly health and economic enemy. ""Government realises it needs business and business understands how much it needs government,"" she said. She described the government's intervention to support workers wages during the lockdown as a ""vital way for the economy to hibernate"". But the CBI on Thursday urged the government to focus on how the UK emerges from that hibernation. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Dame Carolyn called on the government to make employment for young workers the government's top priority, as well as ensuring the UK emerges from the crisis with a focus on investment in environmentally sustainable industries. Dame Carolyn was set to stand down this year anyway, but agreed to extend her term until the end of the year given the ongoing health and economic crisis. This is not the swansong she would have wanted. The UK is forecast to experience the worst economic downturn of any major European economy according to figures out yesterday from the OECD. A government spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that we want to reach an agreement with the EU this year and we are prepared to work hard to accelerate talks. This was what both sides agreed to in the political declaration. ""If we don't negotiate a Canada-style FTA [free trade agreement], we'll leave with an Australia-style relationship. Whatever happens we will be leaving the single market and customs union at the end of this year. ""We have taken unprecedented action to support businesses through this pandemic and to ensure the UK's economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible. Extending the transition period would simply prolong the negotiations and create more uncertainty for businesses."" What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"This video can not be played ""It is different when you're not getting that face-to-face contact"" Drug and alcohol addiction referrals have fallen by 57% during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a charity. Kaleidoscope said the ""significant reduction"" came after it closed non-clinical bases and recovery hubs on 18 March. The charity's chief executive said people who cannot access such help get ""exponentially worse"". The Welsh Government said services had ""adapted rapidly"" during the pandemic. Kaleidoscope covers the Gwent area, Powys and north Wales, with each region seeing referrals drop. Comparing drug referrals from 18 March to 30 May in 2019, and the same period this year, it said: In the Gwent area they dropped 51% from 291 to 143 In Powys they fell 41% from 140 to 83 In north Wales they fell 73% from 106 to 29 There were similar drops in alcohol referrals. Kaleidoscope boss Martin Blakebrough feared people's problems could get worse Chief executive Martin Blakebrough said: ""With drugs or alcohol, if you're not coming into services those problems get exponentially worse."" It was not just about drug services but ancillary services like hepatitis C vaccinations, Mr Blakebrough said. ""We will see an increase in deaths if we're not careful,"" he said. Kaleidoscope and other charities in Wales have changed the way they help people. Changes include video calls, online chats and more phone calls. Carol Hardy, manager of the Living Room, a charity that helps drug and alcohol addicts in Cardiff, said: ""The figures don't surprise me at all. Being dependent, especially on alcohol and drugs, requires a person to isolate themselves. It's the isolation and loneliness - that's what the addiction wants. ""It broke my heart when the lockdown came in March because this is going to be very difficult for people and that's what has happened. Rachel Cook from Welshpool has had a drug problem for 20 years. The 44-year-old has relapsed four times but has been drug and alcohol-free for a year and a half since getting help four years ago. She said she had found not having face-to-face meetings ""very difficult"". ""It is different when you're not getting that face-to-face contact, you're not getting that cup of tea when you get in the door, when you're not sitting down in the waiting room chatting to other people in recovery,"" she said. Rachel has been volunteering with Kaleidoscope for two years supporting others with their problems. ""Face-to-face is so important - you can tell so much about somebody by just looking at them,"" she said. ""It's so easy to just say I'm fine, I'm doing okay, when you're just absolutely falling apart."" Wales's drug and alcohol helpline, Dan 24/7, saw a fall in calls in the first few weeks of lockdown. In April 2019, 439 people called. In April this year, 300 rang. Anti-drug work 'not making difference needed' in Wales Drug-related deaths reach record levels in Wales Coronavirus: 'Going to buy drugs' among lockdown breach excuses Helpline services manager Luke Ogden said: ""We hear a lot on the news about how services, businesses and places of work have to cease operation, and it may be that people think this is the case with health-related services."" He said help was still available for anyone in Wales. Dan 24/7 said during May it had experienced an increase in calls, with about 120 more than in April. Most concerned alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis. Experts said the drop in referrals was worrying. Rachel Cook said face-to-face contact was important in helping treat people with addictions There were also concerns about the impact of social distancing on services. Retired clinical psychologist Richard Pates spent 25 years in the drug and alcohol field. The former chairman of the Welsh advisory panel on substance misuse said: ""One of the things that good addiction services can offer is that trust and building up a relationship with people. ""It is very hard to build up a relationship entirely on the phone."" So much relied on non-verbal cues, he said. ""Those are very difficult to replicate,"" he said. This video can not be played The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to patients of addiction treatment centre David Nutt of Imperial College London is chairman of charity Drug Science. He said: ""The first thing is, to be online, you've got to have access to this kind of equipment, and that's not universal. ""The second thing is, if you are in shared accommodation, it can be quite embarrassing to be having these kind of conversations with other people sitting around listening to you. ""Third, we don't know whether online interviews, online therapy, actually works."" There are fears that with less treatment available, and fewer people in treatment, more will go back to old habits. That could mean more deaths. Prof Nutt expected people to return to ""street use"". ""They'll have their dealers coming and they'll be slipping off the methadone back onto the heroin or even worse, the fentanyl,"" he said. ""We are going to find a lot of them will have turned to alcohol because that's easy to get, and they'll have been dampening down their withdrawal and their anxieties with alcohol."" He expected ""a small blip"" in deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

"The statue of Robert Baden-Powell is being removed for ""its protection"" A statue of the man who founded the Scouts movement is to be removed from Poole Quay amid fears it is on a ""target list for attack"". Following police information, the 12-year-old statue of Robert Baden-Powell is to be ""temporarily"" removed to protect it, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council said. The statue will have 24-hour security protection until it can be removed. Protesters gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue. Baden-Powell, who died aged 83 in 1941, has been criticised by campaigners who haveaccused him of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler. In a statement, BCP deputy leader Mark Howell said it had made the decision ""quickly"" following the listing of the statue on a website detailing potential targets for attacks. He said it would not be removed immediately as its foundations were deeper than first thought, but in the meantime it would be given 24-hour security protection. ""We know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powell's and the Scout movement's links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue. However, we feel it is responsible to protect it for future generations to enjoy and respect. He insisted any removal would be temporary and it would be returned ""as soon as the threat level subsides"". The authority previously said it recognised some aspects of Baden-Powell's life were considered ""less worthy of commemoration"" and it planned to involve all relevant communities and groups in discussions about its future. Former Bournemouth East Labour parliamentary candidate Corrie Drew, said: ""We can commemorate the positive work without commemorating the man."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she added: ""A quick look into his history shows that he was very open about his views against homosexuality and that he was a very open supporter of Hitler and of fascism and quite a strong, outspoken racist."" Meanwhile, an online petition to ""defend Poole's Lord Baden-Powell statue"" has received more than 15,000 signatures. Sir Robert Syms, Conservative MP for Poole,tweeted,externalthat he was ""opposed"" to the permanent removal of the statue. Writing on Twitter,,externalTobias Ellwood, Tory MP for Bournemouth East, said: ""Few historical figures comply with 21st C values. Simply expunging past connections from sight won't correct wrongs or help us better learn from our past."" The Tory MP for Bournemouth West, Conor Burns, alsotweeted,externalthat the removal was ""a huge error of judgment"" and urged authorities to ""put it back"".

""We appreciate the local council has a difficult decision taking into account the various opposing views held by members of the public,"" the force said. A spokesman for the Scout Association said it was ""resolute in its commitment to inclusion and diversity and members continually reflect and challenge ourselves in how we live our values"". ""We look forward to discussing this matter with the council to make an informed decision on what happens next,"" he said. A group of local residents gathered at the quayside to protest at the planned removal A group of local residents gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue. Sharon Warne, 53, said controversial statues should have information panels installed explaining the positive and negative points about the figures they depict. ""He had a bad past but he was the founder of the Scouts which today is a great organisation and it's ridiculous to get rid of him,"" she added. Rover Scout Matthew Trott, 28, who travelled from Cwmbran in Wales, said the proposal to remove the statue was ""necessary to protect it"". ""I'd rather see the statue placed in a box in a warehouse for the moment rather than at the bottom of the harbour,"" he said. On Sunday, protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in Bristol tore down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colstonand dumped it in the city's harbour. A statue ofslaveholder Robert Milligan has also been removedfrom outside the Museum of London Docklands, while in Oxfordthousands of people called for the removalof a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes.

"European food delivery app Just Eat Takeaway has agreed to buy US rival Grubhub in a $7.3bn (Â£5.75bn) deal. If the takeover is completed it will create the world's biggest food delivery company outside China. The combined firm will have more than 70 million active customers who place close to 600 million orders a year. The announcement comes after talks between Grubhub and Uber failed as their potential merger faced competition scrutiny. Just Eat Takeaway's chief executive Jitse Groen highlighted the importance to the deal's success of his long-standing relationship with his counterpart at Grubhub Matt Maloney. ""Matt and I are the two remaining food delivery veterans in the sector, having started our respective businesses at the turn of the century, albeit on two different continents,"" he said. ""Both of us have a firm belief that only businesses with high-quality and profitable growth will sustain in our sector."" The deal comes amid a surge in demand for deliveries of takeaway food as people stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic. Even before Covid-19, taken together Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub last year reported revenues that totalled $3bn and a profit of $447m. Analysts have said consolidation in the food delivery industry is long overdue as companies have to spend huge amounts of money to gain and retain their customers. The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. Just Eat battle ends with Takeaway.com as victor Grubhub adds restaurants without permission Why is the takeaway war hotting up? Chicago-based Grubhub has had on-off takeover talks for some time with larger rival Uber. But Uber signalled on Wednesday that it was no longer pursuing a potential tie up with Grubhub. ""Like ridesharing, the food delivery industry will need consolidation in order to reach its full potential for consumers and restaurants. That doesn't mean we are interested in doing any deal, at any price, with any player,"" said Uber spokesperson Noah Edwardsen. Just Eat Takeaway was created by the merger of the UK's Just Eat and Netherlands-based Takeaway. The $7.8bn deal was given the go ahead in April this year after an investigation by the UK's competition authority. Grubhub's shares rose by more than 4% in after hours trade in New York.

"Applicants to university have to be told how they will be taught More students think they are not getting good value for money from university, suggests an annual survey. It found 31% of students thought their courses were poor or very poor value, up from 29% last year. The survey, based on 10,000 students across the UK, was gathered in a year disrupted by Covid-19 and lecturers' strikes. ""Because of strikes and coronavirus there has been a massive gap in my learning,"" it quoted one student. The Student Academic Experience Survey, which has been tracking student views since 2006, shows a decline in satisfaction with value for money - down from 41% to 39% - with another 30% thinking it was neither good or bad value. The survey is published by the Higher Education Policy Institute - and its director Nick Hillman said the survey showed that with disruption to studies and anxieties about the future jobs market ""many students are worried about their own lives"". Alison Johns, chief executive of Advance HE, which co-produced the report, said it was a ""continuing and significant concern"" that ethnic minority students reported a less positive university experience than white students. Should I go to university this year? Students might have to stay in protective bubbles Students feel ignored in fee refund claim The study considers universities across the UK, and found tuition fees - charged in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - were the biggest cause for disquiet. Only about a quarter of students felt they had been given enough information on how fees were spent. There were also concerns about a lack of contact hours with teaching staff - which was linked to the strikes and the closure of campuses due to the coronavirus outbreak. In terms of what made a positive difference, students highlighted the importance of the quality of teaching. There were also signs that more students felt they were getting useful feedback from staff on work that had been assessed. The survey revealed widespread worries about well-being among students, with low levels of positive responses. Only 11% agreed they had ""life satisfaction"" and 15% saw their lives as ""worthwhile"". A significant majority - 84% - believed universities should be able to contact students' parents or guardians if there were serious concerns about a student's mental health. Mr Hillman said if financial pressures on universities meant cutting services, this suggested that support services for mental health ""should not be at the front of the queue for those cuts"". The survey this year looked more closely at the experience of students who got places through the clearing system - where students are matched with empty places after exam results are published. About a fifth of students in the survey had gone through clearing - and only 54% of these said they would choose the same course and university again. Universities will be preparing to reopen campuses for the autumn - and applicants will be wondering how courses will be taught, whether online or in-person or a mixture of both. The higher education, the Office for Students, has told universities in England the information they must give to those applying - with 18 June the deadline for making a firm choice. Universities will have to specify the balance between online and face-to-face teaching, the hours with teaching staff and access to facilities such as libraries. If there are parts of a course that are no longer possible, such as placements or field trips, these will have to be highlighted. And there will have to be clarity over how much will be paid in fees and how the course will be assessed. ""These are exceptionally challenging times for both students and universities, but students must be told clearly how their courses will be taught next year,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students.

"Tourism leaders from 60 of the biggest tourist attractions in Wales have issued a second plea to First Minister Mark Drakeford for a roadmap for reopening. More than a quarter of workers in Wales have been furloughed, new Treasury figures show Additional dental services will be restored from 1 July, says NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall A charity has seen referrals for drug and alcohol addiction fall by more than half under lockdown Shopping arcades in Cardiff are planning a one-way system for when they are allowed to reopen Science education centres say they need money to keep going as social distancing will cut visitor numbers Six more deaths with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales, taking the total 1,425 Andy Roberts and Gemma Ryall That's all from our live page coverage of coronavirus in Wales today. Today's main developments include:  We'll be back at 07:00 BST on Friday with the latest news and updates. Fiona Bruce presents Question Time from Cardiff on BBC One Wales tonight at 22:45 BST.

The Welsh Government has said the safe reopening of tourist attractions ""is at the forefront of our minds"", after a letter from 60 major operators warned that the sector was on the ""brink of collapse"". Tourist attractions in Wales remain closed amid the coronavirus lockdown, with no information on when they can reopen. Having written a letter of warning back in May, the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions has written to the Welsh Government again, claiming inaction from it would lead to ""economic disaster"" for the country. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We hear what businesses are saying and are acutely aware of the challenges they are facing. ""But we have to be guided by the medical and scientific advice to ensure we only lift restrictions when they are safe to do so."" The spokesman added that the next point of review was on 18 June. However, Economy Minister Ken Skates indicated on Wednesday that  the review after that - on 9 July - could be the point when he could say ""something positive"". The chief executive of the Football Association of Wales has called on the Welsh Government
 to allow fans into football stadiums at a reduced capacity. Jonathan Ford told Senedd members that such a move would enable clubs to earn money when they return to playing competitive matches. The Cymru Premier season was curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic and no date has
 been set for the league to return as yet. He gave the example of Barry Town, who play at a 2,500-capacity stadium but ""would be delighted with 500 paying punters coming through the doorâ. âFive hundred people is a large gathering in a confined space, but in a large space with social distancing
 it arguably could be and should be permitted,â Mr Ford told the culture, Welsh language and communications committee. The chair of the Welsh Rugby Union says that the effect of coronavirus on its budget has
 been âcatastrophicâ. Gareth Davies told the Seneddâs culture, Welsh language and communications committee that
 the last-minute cancellation of the Wales v Scotland Six Nations match on 13 March cost the union Â£10m. Mr Davies added that the unionâs annual turnover was Â£90m. He had previously warned thatWelsh rugby would suffer financial ""pain""if games resumed behind closed doors without revenue from ticket sales and hospitality. Plans are in place to introduce social distancing as farmers' markets reopen in Cardiff. In a statement, Cardiff Farmers' Markets thanked customers for their support and announced return dates for markets. ""Weâre now at the stage
where the markets can return - but we need to make some changes in the interest
of safety,"" it said. ""As well as changes to
the market set-up, we will be putting social distancing measures in place to
create an environment which is safe for customers, traders and staff."" Markets will have one-way systems, strict opening hours, card-only payments and fewer stalls, focusing on offering ""a mix of essential food supplies"". Rhiwbina Market will be the first to reopen tomorrow from 10:00 to 13:00 BST.    Holiday park operators in Wales have come together to agree on a strict set of safety and hygiene measures in preparation for the possible reopening of parks in July. On Wednesday, Economy Minister Ken Skates indicated he hoped to be ""able to say something positive for the tourism industry""after a scheduled review of lockdown measureson 9 July. Between them the five operators - Parkdean Resorts, Away Resorts, Haven, Park Leisure and Haulfryn Group - run 19 parks. They are writing to MPs and members of the Senedd to stress how their parks can reopen safely, and to warn of the economic risk to the Welsh economy of any delay in reopening. The measures include floor markings to help social distancing, one-way systems, deep cleaning of caravans, hand sanitiser points and the continued closure of communal facilities including restaurants. Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the British Holiday and Home Parks Association and boss of Celtic Holiday Parks in Pembrokeshire, said the sector was ""the mainstay of the Welsh rural and coastal economy"". ""We and our customers support local jobs, from those in shops, garages and plumbers to pubs, restaurants and tourist attractions,"" he said. ""When the time is right, it is essential that our parks reopen and our customers return to safeguard those jobs.â Tourism leaders from 60 of the biggest tourist attractions in Wales have issued a second plea to First Minister Mark Drakeford for a roadmap for reopening. Tourist attractions in Wales remain closed, with no information about when they can reopen. The Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions said the industry is on the ""brink of collapse"" and inaction from Welsh Government will lead to ""economic disaster"" for the country. Tourism leaders from some of the most popular visitor attractions in Wales have issued a joint statement calling for urgent clarity around dates for reopening following the coronavirus lockdown. The new statement follows a previous letter sent to the first minister on 27 May. The second letter, signed by over 60 leisure industry bosses from a range of high profile tourist destinations, including Snowdon Mountain Railway, Zip World and the National Botanic Garden of Wales, warns the Welsh tourism industry warns that the absence of a roadmap to reopening is ""causing harm"". The Welsh Government ""hopes to be able to say something positive"" for the tourism industry when lockdown restrictions are reviewed in July, the economy minister has said. Ken Skates singled out 9 July as a possible date for that decision. The
coronavirus pandemic has âincredibly negatively impactedâ all sport in Wales
âfrom grassroots to the very topâ, a Senedd committee has heard. Brian
Davies, acting chief executive of Sport Wales, told the culture, Welsh language and communications committee that his organisation has had 633 applications for
emergency funding since the beginning of the pandemic. Although 280
applications have been successful, a further 280 have been rejected. The remainder
of applications are still being considered. Mr Davies
also said Sport Wales has re-purposed Â£9m of its budget to be spent
on responding to the effects of the pandemic. âAll
sport has been incredibly negatively impacted,â said Mr Davies. âWhat is
clear is that the seasonality of sport has meant that some sports have really
felt it immediately, they are in the middle of their season or their season was
about to start so clearly for some sports the impact has been immediate and
significant.â It is vitally important that parents know the signs of type 1 diabetes, Cardiff and Vale health board says. It said it is especially important in lockdown when children are only spending time with immediate family. It is highlighting the four Ts: Allow Twitter content?

like home"" is perhaps not so heart-warming a thought these days. After
all, most of us have been locked down in our house or apartment for a very long
time. The
coronavirus pandemic will, however,do more than change the way
we might feel about our homes. It has the potential to have a huge impact on
property markets around the world. It
is fairly clear that with massive unemployment, wage cuts, business failures,
and job uncertainty, many people are likely to be cautious about making the
biggest investment of their lives - buying a home. Normally
that leads to falling house prices, and during the last recession and credit
crunch that is what we saw in the UK, US and many other countries. More than 1,000 people have gathered in Newport to march in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many carried placards bearing political slogans while others knelt on one knee - a protest against racism that stems from the US. The demonstrators marched from the civic centre toward the University of South Wales building on the banks of the River Usk. Drivers could be heard honking horns in support as they walked. More than 2,000 people in Wales have been given Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for breaking lockdown rules. Since they were introduced on 27 March, 2,282 FPNs were given out in Wales before 8 June. The National Police Chief's Council's statistics show that roughly 30 FPNs a day are issued in Wales, the highest of which was by Dyfed-Powys Police. Of the FPNs in Wales, 76% were issues to men and 62% were to individuals aged between 16 and 34. The total number of FPNs issued by each of Wales' police forces are: Six more people with coronavirus are reported to have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,425, according to Public Health Wales. This graph shows the number of deaths by the day they occurred, rather than the day they were announced. Six more people with coronavirus have died in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures, taking the total to 1,425. These are where laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of coronavirus, and mostly involve deaths in hospital. Five council areas of Wales - Ceredigion, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Pembrokeshire and Torfaen - reported no new positive tests. To date, 102,546 individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Wales, with 87,875 testing negative. Pride Cymru's Big Weekend will not go ahead in Cardiff as planned but will instead go virtual. ""We could not in good conscience continue to plan for an event which attracts over 50,000 people to Cardiff,"" Pride Cymru tweeted. The virtual Big Week will run from Monday 24 to Sunday 30 August and will ""be a time for us all to celebrate our diverse community,"" it added. It is the latest major event to bereorganised

There were no new positive tests reported in five council areas of Wales in the latest set of figures. Brexit trade negotiations and Covid-19
are""two
perfect storms"", a Welsh Government minister has said. Lesley
Griffiths, who is responsible for rural affairs, said ""the window of
opportunity to secure a deal is getting very, very small"". The
UK is due to leave the EU without a trade deal unless an agreement can be found
before the end of the year. The
UK government says it wants to reach an agreement with the EU during 2020. On
Thursday, business leaders warned that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic
for British firms. Dame
Carolyn Fairbairn, from industry body, the CBI, told the BBC that any buffers
to cope with the additional cost and planning of an exit from the EU customs
union and single market without a deal had been exhausted by the Covid-19
pandemic. The number of patients being treated in critical care beds with coronavirus in Wales has fallen to its lowest number since 25 March. A total of 32 people are being treated on invasive ventilated beds - including in critical care - for coronavirus, according to the latest NHS Wales figures. There were 885 covid-related patients in hospital beds - this is lower than last week but still the equivalent of three large hospitals being filled with patients with the virus, according to the chief executive of NHS Wales. Dr Andrew Goodall said: ""The majority of people being treated in critical care now do not have coronavirus, which importantly shows more NHS work is taking place."" Meanwhile, the figures also show: NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the 19 field
hospitals established in Wales remain ""a contingency""
but discussions were being held with health boards about whether there was ""some other supportive role that could be played by those field hospitals
as well"". He said there was an
exercise underway ""to actually judge what capacity we need to retain""
to deal with any future further coronavirus peak. ""I think that just having a
field hospital staffed across Wales, when they're not required wouldn't make
sense,"" he said. Dr Goodall confirmed the temporary
hospitals, such as the Dragon's Heart Hospital, inside Cardiff's Principality
Stadium, had cost a total of around Â£160m to establish. ""That was an investment for
preparation, that was an investment under the principles of investing to save
lives and to protect the Welsh population, and obviously we will want to make
sure that we have some further opportunity to use those going forward,"" he
said. ""But those plans may adapt and
change."" Cardiff's Principality Stadium has been turned into the Dragon's Heart Hospital Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.3898004e-06

We will be back early tomorrow morning with more updates on how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Scotland. Stay safe. TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) has calculated,external, for the first time, the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on household spending. It found that a typical household in the UK normally spent an average of Â£182 a week on activities, such as travel, holidays and meals out, which have been mostly curtailed during the virus outbreak. Many households have been saving that money or using it to cover any loss of income - but there remains the need for about 53% of income to be spent on essentials, such as food and housing. For young people a greater proportion of their income goes on essentials than other groups. With little in savings and less chance to cut spending, the under-30s are likely to be hit the hardest if their income drops. Read more. Allow Twitter content?

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland As well as announcing asmall drop in the R numbertoday- essentially the rate at which the virus spreads - the first minister was adamant that the 2m distancing rule remains best for now. Prof Susan Michie, co-director of the Behavioural Sciences Policy Research Unit for England and Wales, agrees. ""The further away you are, the less risk it is,"" she states on BBC Radio Scotland. ""If it's less than 2m, there needs to be a very low rate of transmission and there needs to be a lot of other measures. Remember, we still have thousands of people catching this horrible disease every week."" However, Dr Mike Longeran, a senior statistician and epidemiologist at Dundee University, takes another view after compiling various studies, saying the rates of infection are ""pretty much the same"" for the different recommended distances. But Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, an expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, quickly points out thatsuper-spreadersare a serious problem and the evidence tells us the closer people were to the source, the quicker they were infected. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK would have been halvedif lockdown had been introduced a week earlier, is what Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government adviser, asserted yesterday. Do John Beattie's panel of experts agree on this one? Dr Mike Longeran gives an emphatic yes, adding that the number would have doubled if it had come a week later. Dr Christine Tait-Burkard says the UK had more time to react than most parts of Europe but didn't respond adequately, although she believes the high death rate is not simply down to not locking down fast enough, saying that the number of care home fatalities is a tragedy that could have been prevented. And Prof Susan Michie has already put her name to a letter calling for a public inquiry, saying we need more transparency. ""[The UK government] have not published what has informed their decision-making, so that everybody can judge for themselves,"" she said. ""To what extent are things being done for other political reasons? To what extent is it being done for scientific, evidence-based reasons?"" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Businesses on island communities may not be able to open while the 2m rule is in operation, the chairman of Visit Mull & Iona says. Colin Morrison says many will be ""pretty hopeful"" the distance can be reduced by 15 July, when the tourism sector has been given the go-ahead to reopen. The islands face the ""added issue"" of ferries, which may only be able to run at 20% capacity he adds. Elaine Tulloch of Destination Orkney says the provisional date has brought some comfort to the sector and they will be looking to work with transport operators in the coming weeks. The chief executive says the sector wanted to open in a way that is safe and part of a joined-up approach.

Robin McAlpine argues on Drivetime this would help alter the structure of Scottish tourism but encourage more sustainable domestic holidays going forward, rather than using cash to bailout hotels directly. ""We are saying take your family on holiday to save the Scottish economy,"" he adds. Mr McAlpine also suggests providing a basic income for artists. He says this security would help the community return to normality sooner and lead to an outpouring of Scottish culture. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

How likely children are to catch and spread coronavirus is a frequent topic when it comes to discussing reopening schools. The problem is that Covid-19 is a new disease and not something scientists have had long to study - meaning the available data on the subject that's currently available is sparse. Our health correspondent Laura Foster explains what we do know currently about how children are affected by the virus. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Yesterday, Scotland's tourism businesses, including pubs, hotels and restaurants, were told to prepare to reopen on 15 July. Following a phone call with the first minister, Stephen Leckie, chief executive of the Crieff Hydro Group, says he is ""optimistic"" about the prospect of getting back to business by then but warns life will be tough if social distancing regulations remain in place, with some businesses simply unable to operate. ""Assuming it happens, it's not the panacea we need,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But it is all a step in the right direction and for that we are grateful."" Mr Leckie, who plans to open the restaurants on his premises, said he was waiting to hear more on PPE requirements for the sector, but thinks there will be a focus on face masks and screening. He also reckons it is unlikely that self catering accommodations or caravan parks will be allowed to open any earlier than 15 July. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Footage shared online shows a male officer being pinned to the ground and kicked The home secretary and the Police Federation have condemned a video which shows an officer on the ground apparently being kicked. Video circulating on social media shows an officer struggling with a man in Frampton Park Road in Hackney, north London. The footage was branded ""sickening"" by Priti Patel, while the federation said: ""We are not society's punch bags."" Four people have since been arrested on suspicion of assault on police. They include a 13-year-old boy and three men, aged 20, 32 and 34. The officers, a man and a woman, suffered minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment, the Met Police said. A member of the public, who had claimed to have been assaulted, flagged down the police on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the Met said: ""As an officer attempted to speak with those involved, one of the men resisted and a struggle ensued. A number of other people became involved whilst the officer was on the ground."" An officer was filmed while he was pinned to the ground in Frampton Park Road Footage appears to show the officer trying to restrain a man but they then fall to the ground with the officer pinned underneath. Passers-by began filming and taking selfies as the officer and the suspect grappled. The female officer attempted to keep people away from the scene and also suffered injuries before more officers arrived and the first two arrests were made. Tom Symonds,BBC Home Affairs correspondent Two police officers, presumably awaiting backup, are having to fight for control, on a London pavement, surrounded by people, seemingly hostile. As is so often the case, phones came out of pockets as the incident developed, so the video doesn't show what happened in the minutes before. That is crucial since officers have to justify the force they use. Even before George Floyd's death, any number of controversial arrests in recent years have demonstrated that a single video posted on social media can transform the public's opinion of an incident, and therefore their views of the police. This investigation may be able to rely on the officer's own body-worn video cameras, increasingly vital in establishing the context. But more generally, figures show the number of reported assaults on police officers have been rising steadily since 2014. This, during a period when police numbers fell because of years of austerity.  Fewer officers on the streets means fewer officers to respond, when their colleagues get into difficulty. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: ""Yet again this starkly shows the dangers [officers] face and the bravery they show each and every day keeping Londoners safe. ""We are not society's punch bags. We have families we want to go home to at the end of every shift, but the dangers are stark and seemingly escalating."" Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurt 'I thought I need to stop him or he will kill me' Police officer attacked during pursuit Supt Martin Rolston said: ""This incident, which was captured on someone's mobile phone is truly shocking. ""My officers went to the assistance of a member of the public - who asked for their help - after stating that they had been assaulted. ""What happened next is a reminder of the risks our officers take whilst going about their duties."" Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: ""Sickening, shocking & disgraceful. ""My thoughts are with the outstanding officers who were subject to this disgusting violent attack."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I utterly condemn the disgraceful attack on two Metropolitan Police officers this afternoon. ""These brave officers were doing their duty and assisting the public. We owe them a debt of gratitude.""

Spain's first La Liga game since 10 March is being played behind closed doors at Sevilla's stadium.

The recommendations say:  The Department of Transport's advice remains that people should avoid non-essential travel. The guidelines have been criticised as ""nonsensical"" by the airline industry which has been hit hard by Covid-19 travel restrictions. Read the full story here. Russell HottenBBC Business Reporter Gary Hume silk tapestry from 1998, shown in a BA lounge at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 British Airways is selling some of its multi-million-pound art collection to raise cash to help it through the coronavirus pandemic. The collection includes pieces by Damien Hirst, Bridget Riley and Peter Doig, with one work believed to have been valued at more than Â£1m. It is understood at least 10 pieces have been identified for sale, although exactly which ones is unclear. BA - like many airlines - has seen a collapse in demand for air travel during the pandemic and is set to cut thousands of jobs. Last week, BA boss Alex Cruz warned that the cash-strapped airline's survival was at stake unless there was a drastic restructuring of the business. Other works in the collection include pieces by Tracey Emin, Anish Kapoor and Chris Ofili. The airline would not comment on the sale, nor identify which works would go under the hammer. Let's just recap on the test and trace scheme introduced by the UK's National Health Service to help lift lockdown measures and curb the spread of coronavirus. Thousands of contact tracers have been recruited to notify people - by email, text or by phone - if they've come into contact with someone with Covid-19. How does it work and how can it keep the R number low? We explain in the video below.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has accepted that businesses cannot cope with problems stemming from the outbreak and at the same time deal with post-Brexit disruption at the border, the FT says. Instead, the government will bring in a temporary light-touch system at ports, the paper reports. The Rio de Paz group dug 100 symbolic ""graves"" A memorial to victims of the coronavirus in Brazil has been vandalised by supporters of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, activists say. Members of the Rio de Paz civil society group had dug 100 symbolic shallow graves in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach to represent those killed in the pandemic. Each grave was marked by a cross. Brazil has recorded more than 772,000 cases - the world's second-highest number - and nearly 40,000 deaths. Later, a group of people opposed to the tribute gathered nearby and mocked the activists. Rio de Paz said they were supporters of Bolsonaro. One of the group then began knocking down the crosses. Adding to the confusion, a passer-by who said his son had died from Covid-19 then began replacing the crosses. Mr Bolsonaro has opposed lockdown measures and downplayed the virus as ""a little flu"".

Tarhub AsgharBBC Urdu, Lahore Rail passengers in Lahore: restrictions began to be eased last month The government of Punjab has started closing quarantine centres
across Pakistan's most populous province, despite a rapidly rising number of coronavirus
cases. Lahore Deputy Commissioner Danish
Afzal told BBC Urdu that no-one suspected of having coronavirus was left in the
centres. ""According to new policies we're focusing
more on keeping asymptomatic patients in home isolation,"" he added. Travellers from
abroad are now being tested for Covid-19 at the airport and sent directly
to their homes instead of to quarantine centres, as had previously been
required. Six such centres are being closed in
Lahore, along with others in different cities in Punjab. The move comes amid
concern as cases in Punjab and other parts of Pakistan are rapidly increasing after
measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus were eased.

open for under-16s during the pandemic did not lead to any major outbreaks of
Covid 19, according to the country's education minister. Anna Ekstrom said research by the Swedish Public Health
Agency  showed that Swedes working in education - including teachers,
daycare staff and teaching assistants - had not been more likely to be
diagnosed with coronavirus than those in other occupational groups. Schools for older pupils and
universities have been given the go-ahead to reopen from 15 June - but for summer schools and courses
only. Sweden is set to relax a number of
other national recommendations in the coming days. From Saturday, Swedes without any
Covid-19 symptoms can travel freely within the country. And on Sunday elite sports can start
up again, although no fans will be allowed to watch events. More now on the slump in US financial markets on fears that an increase in coronavirus cases would hurt the economic recovery. It comes a day after the US central bank said the country faced a long road to recovery.

European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100 sinking about 4%. Economists have warned that people will stay home voluntarily if they are afraid of getting sick. Read more here. Bowling alleys have been allowed to operate in Texas Texas, the second-most populous state in the US, reported 2,504 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday. It is the most reported in a day in the state since the pandemic began and marks a spike following the US Memorial Day holiday weekend at the end of May. The state's previous record-high was 1,949 new cases on 31 May,the Texas Tribune reports.,external Wednesday was also the third consecutive day that the number of Texans sent to hospital for Covid-19 rose, with over 2,100 people requiring hospital care. Texas had one of the quickest reopening policies in the nation: stores, restaurants and theatres reopened, albeit with limited capacity, on 1 May, even though the state had seen rising case counts at the time. Since then, bars, aquariums, rodeos, bingo halls and bowling alleys have also been allowed to open. Businesses continue to reopen in the state, and on Friday, as phase three begins, restaurants will be able to operate at 75% capacity.

"This video can not be played ""It is different when you're not getting that face-to-face contact"" Drug and alcohol addiction referrals have fallen by 57% during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a charity. Kaleidoscope said the ""significant reduction"" came after it closed non-clinical bases and recovery hubs on 18 March. The charity's chief executive said people who cannot access such help get ""exponentially worse"". The Welsh Government said services had ""adapted rapidly"" during the pandemic. Kaleidoscope covers the Gwent area, Powys and north Wales, with each region seeing referrals drop. Comparing drug referrals from 18 March to 30 May in 2019, and the same period this year, it said: In the Gwent area they dropped 51% from 291 to 143 In Powys they fell 41% from 140 to 83 In north Wales they fell 73% from 106 to 29 There were similar drops in alcohol referrals. Kaleidoscope boss Martin Blakebrough feared people's problems could get worse Chief executive Martin Blakebrough said: ""With drugs or alcohol, if you're not coming into services those problems get exponentially worse."" It was not just about drug services but ancillary services like hepatitis C vaccinations, Mr Blakebrough said. ""We will see an increase in deaths if we're not careful,"" he said. Kaleidoscope and other charities in Wales have changed the way they help people. Changes include video calls, online chats and more phone calls. Carol Hardy, manager of the Living Room, a charity that helps drug and alcohol addicts in Cardiff, said: ""The figures don't surprise me at all. Being dependent, especially on alcohol and drugs, requires a person to isolate themselves. It's the isolation and loneliness - that's what the addiction wants. ""It broke my heart when the lockdown came in March because this is going to be very difficult for people and that's what has happened. Rachel Cook from Welshpool has had a drug problem for 20 years. The 44-year-old has relapsed four times but has been drug and alcohol-free for a year and a half since getting help four years ago. She said she had found not having face-to-face meetings ""very difficult"". ""It is different when you're not getting that face-to-face contact, you're not getting that cup of tea when you get in the door, when you're not sitting down in the waiting room chatting to other people in recovery,"" she said. Rachel has been volunteering with Kaleidoscope for two years supporting others with their problems. ""Face-to-face is so important - you can tell so much about somebody by just looking at them,"" she said. ""It's so easy to just say I'm fine, I'm doing okay, when you're just absolutely falling apart."" Wales's drug and alcohol helpline, Dan 24/7, saw a fall in calls in the first few weeks of lockdown. In April 2019, 439 people called. In April this year, 300 rang. Anti-drug work 'not making difference needed' in Wales Drug-related deaths reach record levels in Wales Coronavirus: 'Going to buy drugs' among lockdown breach excuses Helpline services manager Luke Ogden said: ""We hear a lot on the news about how services, businesses and places of work have to cease operation, and it may be that people think this is the case with health-related services."" He said help was still available for anyone in Wales. Dan 24/7 said during May it had experienced an increase in calls, with about 120 more than in April. Most concerned alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis. Experts said the drop in referrals was worrying. Rachel Cook said face-to-face contact was important in helping treat people with addictions There were also concerns about the impact of social distancing on services. Retired clinical psychologist Richard Pates spent 25 years in the drug and alcohol field. The former chairman of the Welsh advisory panel on substance misuse said: ""One of the things that good addiction services can offer is that trust and building up a relationship with people. ""It is very hard to build up a relationship entirely on the phone."" So much relied on non-verbal cues, he said. ""Those are very difficult to replicate,"" he said. This video can not be played The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to patients of addiction treatment centre David Nutt of Imperial College London is chairman of charity Drug Science. He said: ""The first thing is, to be online, you've got to have access to this kind of equipment, and that's not universal. ""The second thing is, if you are in shared accommodation, it can be quite embarrassing to be having these kind of conversations with other people sitting around listening to you. ""Third, we don't know whether online interviews, online therapy, actually works."" There are fears that with less treatment available, and fewer people in treatment, more will go back to old habits. That could mean more deaths. Prof Nutt expected people to return to ""street use"". ""They'll have their dealers coming and they'll be slipping off the methadone back onto the heroin or even worse, the fentanyl,"" he said. ""We are going to find a lot of them will have turned to alcohol because that's easy to get, and they'll have been dampening down their withdrawal and their anxieties with alcohol."" He expected ""a small blip"" in deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

"British firms do not have the resilience to cope with a no-deal Brexit after the battering of the coronavirus crisis, according to the outgoing boss of industry body the CBI. Carolyn Fairbairn said a CBI member had likened a no-deal to ""setting the shed on fire"" while the house was in flames. Brexit trade negotiations have not been going well between the UK and the EU. A government spokesperson said the UK wanted to reach an agreement with the EU this year. Brexit trade deal: What are the sticking points? Brexit: Trade deal still possible with EU, says UK minister UK to start post-Brexit trade talks with Japan Dame Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC that any buffers to cope with the additional cost and planning of an exit from the EU customs union and single market without a deal had been exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The resilience of British business is absolutely on the floor,"" she said. ""Every penny of cash that had been stored up, all the stockpiles prepared have been run down. ""The firms that I speak to have not a spare moment to plan for a no trade deal Brexit at the end of the year - that is the common sense voice that needs to find its way into these negotiations."" Those negotiations are not going well. They broke up last week with the EU's chief negotiator saying that very little progress had been made on key sticking points, including future fishing rights in UK waters, and commitments to maintain a ""level playing field"" over regulation and competition. The devastating impact of Covid-19 and the fight for business survival has diverted management attention away from any Brexit contingency planning, according to Dame Carolyn, who worries that a political commitment to abandon the current transitional trading arrangements - come what may - will add to the burden on business at a critical moment. ""As one member put it to me - just because the house is on fire, it doesn't make it ok to set fire to the garden shed. ""If we have a political timescale that takes us to a brinksmanship deal in December that will be catastrophic for British business - they will not be ready. ""Small businesses were not ready last time there was a no-deal Brexit threat - this time they will not have had a moment to prepare for it."" Dame Carolyn's comments come as the CBI - the UK's most influential business group - confirmed she will be succeeded as director general by Tony Danker in November. Mr Danker is currently chief executive of Be the Business, an organisation set up to improve the efficiency and productivity of UK businesses. A former media executive, he was also a policy adviser to the Treasury. Relations between business groups and the government have been strained ever since the campaign leading up to the EU referendum of 2016, when business groups, including the CBI, warned of economic damage to the UK economy whose biggest customer is the EU. Dame Carolyn is hopeful that this crisis can help build bridges in the face of a common and deadly health and economic enemy. ""Government realises it needs business and business understands how much it needs government,"" she said. She described the government's intervention to support workers wages during the lockdown as a ""vital way for the economy to hibernate"". But the CBI on Thursday urged the government to focus on how the UK emerges from that hibernation. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Dame Carolyn called on the government to make employment for young workers the government's top priority, as well as ensuring the UK emerges from the crisis with a focus on investment in environmentally sustainable industries. Dame Carolyn was set to stand down this year anyway, but agreed to extend her term until the end of the year given the ongoing health and economic crisis. This is not the swansong she would have wanted. The UK is forecast to experience the worst economic downturn of any major European economy according to figures out yesterday from the OECD. A government spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that we want to reach an agreement with the EU this year and we are prepared to work hard to accelerate talks. This was what both sides agreed to in the political declaration. ""If we don't negotiate a Canada-style FTA [free trade agreement], we'll leave with an Australia-style relationship. Whatever happens we will be leaving the single market and customs union at the end of this year. ""We have taken unprecedented action to support businesses through this pandemic and to ensure the UK's economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible. Extending the transition period would simply prolong the negotiations and create more uncertainty for businesses."" What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?
