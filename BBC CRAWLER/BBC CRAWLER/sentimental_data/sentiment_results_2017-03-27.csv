"The home secretary said it was ""absurd"" that terrorists' messages were inaccessible to investigators Chat apps that promise to prevent your messages being accessed by strangers are under scrutiny again following last week's terror attack in London. On Sunday, the home secretary said the intelligence services must be able to access relevant information. Her comments followed the discovery that Khalid Masood appeared to have used WhatsApp minutes before carrying out his killings. There are doubts about whether that action was related to the atrocity. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw has highlighted that the police had declared that they believed Masood had acted alone on the day, and would not have done so unless they had accessed and read messages stored on his phone. Even so, the home secretary has summoned WhatsApp's owner, Facebook, and other technology companies to a meeting on Thursday to discuss ways to ensure that security officers get the data they need in the future. WhatsApp indicates Khalid Masood used WhatsApp a couple of minutes before his attack Several chat apps have adopted a technique called end-to-end encryption. This digitally scrambles their messages' contents when it leaves a sender's device, and then reassembles it on the recipient's computer using a shared key. The technology company running the service is not made privy to the key, so is unable to make sense of the conversation even though it passes through its computer servers. Some apps, including WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, Signal and Threema, use end-to-end encryption by default. Others, such as Telegram, Line and Google's Allo, offer it as an option. If end-to-end encryption is active, the technology company running the app is limited in what useful information it can remotely disclose. But if a phone, tablet or PC is not passcode-protected - or if the authorities find a way to bypass the code - the physical device itself will provide access. London attack: What we know so far What we know about Khalid Masood In depth: Westminster terror attack Man arrested in Birmingham Unscrambled data can be retrieved from iCloud back-ups Not necessarily. When someone sends or reads a message, they generate what's known as ""metadata"" - information about their interaction that is distinct from the chat's contents. This can include: the time a message was written the telephone number or other ID of the person it was sent to the physical locations of the sender and recipient at the time WhatsApp has shared such details with law enforcement officers in the past and has said it has been co-operating with authorities over last week's incident. In addition, if Apple users subscribe to the company's iCloud Backup service, the firm may be able to recover messages copied to its servers for safe-keeping and it has co-operated with investigators in the past. It is not exactly clear. The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, told the BBC that chat apps must not ""provide a secret place"" for terrorists to communicate, and that when a warrant had been issued, officers should be able to ""get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp"". On Sky News,she later added,externalthat she supported end-to-end encryption as a cybersecurity measure, but said it was ""absurd to have a situation where you can have terrorists talking to each other on a formal platform... and it can't be accessed"". How this would work in practice is uncertain. WhatsApp, for example, does not store messages on its servers after they have been delivered. So, even if there was a way to retrospectively unencrypt the chats, it is unclear how this would work without significant changes to its systems. At one point, there had been speculation that the Investigatory Powers Act - which came into effect last year - might ban chat app's use of end-to-end encryption outright. Instead, it stated that technology companies could be compelled to ""provide a technical capability"" to remove ""electronic protection"" within their products -which has been interpreted by some,externalto mean app-makers might be compelled to secretly create backdoors or other security weaknesses to let messages be unscrambled. Recent CIA leaks indicate it can be difficult to keep hacking tools a secret Files leaked by rogue US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden and Wikileaks suggest that even the most closely guarded hacking secrets can be revealed. And even if the tech companies did not share the technical details of the backdoors with the authorities - instead limiting themselves to passing on unscrambled chats - the very fact vulnerabilities existed means someone else might sniff them out. As a consequence, public trust in their software might be undermined. ""The encryption debate always rages after a terror incident, regardless of how effective backdoors would have been,"" said security consultant Troy Hunt. ""Even if, say, the UK was to ban encryption or mandate weaknesses be built into WhatsApp and iMessage, those with nefarious intent would simply obtain encryption products from other sources. ""These responses are kneejerk reactions by those who have little understanding of the efficacy and implications of what they're actually proposing."" The TechUK lobby group said other hacking powers and a move to make internet providers keep a record of their customers' internet habits - which were also outlined in the Investigatory Powers Act - meant counter-terrorism officers already had strong powers to tackle threats. ""From storing data on the cloud to online banking to identity verification, end-to-end encryption is essential for preventing data being accessed illegally in ways that can harm consumers, business and our national security,"" said its deputy chief executive, Antony Walker.

"Qatar's investments in the UK include the Shard skyscraper in London One of the largest investors in the UK has committed Â£5bn of new money to invest in transport, property and digital technology. The Middle Eastern state of Qatar said that it was optimistic about the future of the British economy. It made it clear that the UK leaving the European Union had little bearing on its decision. Qatar has already invested Â£40bn in the UK - it owns Harrods and a 95% stake in the Shard in London. It also has a stake in Canary Wharf in the capital's Docklands, as well as an interest in the Milford Haven liquefied natural gas terminal in South Wales. It also bought the Olympic Village following the London 2012 Olympics. ""Currently the UK is our first investment destination and it is the largest investment destination for Qatari investors, both public and private,"" Ali Shareef al Emadi, the country's finance minister, told the BBC. ""We have more than Â£35bn to Â£40bn of investments already in the UK. ""We're announcing an additional Â£5bn of investment in the next three to five years. ""Mainly this investment will focus on infrastructure sectors, technology, energy and real estate."" Mr Al Emadi will join International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Birmingham on Tuesday where UK firms will showcase projects, including in sport, cyber-security and healthcare. Ali Shareef al Emadi, Qatar's finance minister The government relies on foreign investment to support infrastructure projects such as the new high speed rail link between London, Birmingham and Manchester - HS2. Although no final decisions have been taken on the Qatari investments, Mr Al Emadi did not rule out putting money into HS2. ""We will look at those deals; we will look at electricity, roads, bridges, railways,"" he said. The announcement of the Qatari investment is likely to be welcomed by Number 10. It comes two days before the triggering of Article 50, the official process for leaving the European Union. Theresa May has made it clear she believes the British economy remains a positive place to invest and the Qatari announcement follows UK-focused investment decisions by Sir James Dyson, Google and Nissan. The decline in the value of sterling has made UK assets more attractive to overseas investors - though many economists argue that leaving the EU will damage trade with Britain's largest market and therefore damage growth. ""We always like the UK market, it has always been a good market,"" Mr Al Emadi told me. ""The way we look at our investment in any market, and especially in the UK, it is a very long term investment, so we don't look at any cycles up or down ""So if you are talking about Brexit, I can go back to the financial crisis and tell you the same stories. ""We will do what we think is good for us, it is commercially viable, it has a good vision and a good impact."" Qatar is also the owner of Harrods department store I asked him whether the UK economy outside the EU was likely to be stronger or weaker. ""It is a lot to do with the policy the UK will take, but I think, knowing the UK market, I am very confident they will have a good future,"" Mr Al Emadi answered, saying that it was important that Britain was welcoming to high skilled foreign workers and students from Qatar and elsewhere. Qatar has faced controversy over a fundraising for Barclays Bank at the time of the financial crisis and - more recently - allegations that poor labour conditions have marred the preparations for the 2022 World Cup which is being held in the country. Mr Al Emadi said that Qatar had supported job creation in the UK. ""If you look at what we have done here, it has always been a win-win situation, whatever investment we do in the UK,"" he said. ""When you talk about labour in Qatar, I think a lot of these things have been taken out of proportion and [are] inaccurate news.""

"It is understood Khalid Masood's phone connected with messaging app WhatsApp minutes before the attack The home secretary's broadside over encryption is only one part of a wider struggle with technology companies. The power of the companies has grown enormously in recent years and officials believe they have a responsibility to play more of a role in the fight against terrorism. Last year'srow between Apple and the FBI, in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, was ostensibly about access to a specific encrypted phone used by an attacker. But US law enforcement had long been gearing up for a battle over the issue, looking for the right moment to challenge Apple. Some suspect the UK authorities of doing the same in the wake of the Westminster attack. If there is an issue that the government wants to press the companies on though, it is the hosting of extremist content rather than encryption. It is not clear there is a problem getting hold of the communications of Khalid Masood in this case. But a wider principle is at stake, in whichgovernment is unhappy at the spread of end-to-end encryption. Companies like WhatsApp will say they are providing law enforcement with assistance but they have designed their systems with end-to-end encryption, which means they are not in a position to provide the content of any communications (although the metadata, if available, can still be very useful). In reality, the government knows that outlawing end-to-end encryption is not going to be as easy. It has justpassed new legislation in the Investigatory Powers Billand revisiting the subject seems unlikely. A further problem is that many of the tech companies are not UK-based and the government's leverage over Silicon Valley firms has its limits. The government may be hoping the new US administration will at some point make pressuring the companies a priority, but predicting when or how the Trump administration will act is not easy. Many of the new, smaller companies providing encrypted services are not based in America either. Telegram, for instance, provides encrypted communications but its founder Pavel Durov is thought to be based in Europe. Larger companies point out that if they were banned from offering end-to-end encryption then their customers (and the targets of law enforcement investigation) would simply move to these smaller providers, who, they argue, are even less likely to provide assistance to governments. They also point to all the stories about hacking and criminal theft of data as to why encryption is so valued by them and their customers. In the UK, the responsibility of companies in counter-terrorism hit the agenda whenFacebook faced criticismafter it was claimed it could have done more to spot communications by one of the men who killed Lee Rigby. That spoke to a different issue from encryption - how far should companies be monitoring the material on their sites? And when is this helping to fight terrorism and when is it spying on your own users? The tide of propaganda created by so-called Islamic Statein the last few years has pushed more attention onto what can be found on websites. Counter-terrorist officials place a high priority in restricting this content, since in their view, extremist material does not just have a radicalising effect but is directly involved in inciting acts of violence. This video can not be played Amber Rudd: ""Intelligence services need to be able to get into encrypted services like WhatsApp"" A meeting on extremist content had been previously scheduled for this Thursday, and comments by the home secretary and foreign secretary prioritised this issue (including the company Telegram again, which is seen as a distributor of content). Officials want two things from the companies - a greater prioritisation of the issue and a more proactive rather than reactive stance. YouTube says it rapidly reviews content flagged to it in order to see if it violates the company's community guidelines which prohibit things like gratuitous violence or inciting others to commit violence. But while companies maintain they do remove extremist content when it is reported to them,officials say it is not good enough. The police run a counter-terrorism internet referral unit in which officers have the difficult task of scouring extremist sites for videos of things like beheadings and then flagging them to YouTube and others for removal. Should terror police see WhatsApp chats? The companies concur with almost all of their referrals. But officials ask why it is that the police are having to do this and not the companies themselves? They point out that the companies are huge, rich enterprises full of clever people and ask why they only assign small teams to work on this subject. They want more resources both in terms of people and technology to be assigned to the task. Companies point tothe sharing of 'hashes' between platformswhich relates to material they are removing so that other companies can see if similar images are also present on their sites. They have, in the past, always stressed that such activity is not automated but subject to human review. The companies claim it is technically difficult to scan for extremist content in the same way they do for things like images that show child sex abuse. Officials say that companies that pride themselves on their cleverness should be able to find new - possibly automated - tools. But one of the concerns of companies is that they will be seen as spying on their users. Scanning everybody's posts or messages for extremist content risks making them look intrusive. The reality is, though, that they already scan and mine their user's data for advertising since that is primarily how companies Google and Facebook make their profits. Butthe Edward Snowden revelationshighlighted that co-operation with governments can lead to a backlash. The companies additionally are increasingly global rather than national. They fear precedents being set in one country being used in others. What if other countries also demand extremist content is taken down but define extremist in a different way - perhaps targeting domestic political opposition? China poses a particular dilemma for the tech companies. Apple is in the China market but it is not entirely clear what kind of data it provides to the state. Facebook is keen to get in. Edward Snowden, a former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence Although they have not ruled it out, politicians in the UK know that legislation is unlikely to be the answer to these problems. Their best bet is try to put pressure on the companies through public opinion since they are the users the companies rely on. This tussle has been going on for years but the balance has been shifting in recent months. The fact that they havenot paid much taxhas helped turn public opinion against companies. Recent revelations thatthey have placed advertising next to extremist contenthas also put them on the back foot. The companies say they are not complacent and have indicated they are willing to be more proactive and use technology in new ways. But they also will know that the pressure is mounting.

"The jacket and briefcase were precious possessions of two refugees These are two unremarkable items with a remarkable story: a traditional embroidered jacket and drab, brown leather briefcase. They belonged to a man and a woman who lived in Punjab in undivided colonial India, had been introduced to each other by their parents and were to be engaged when violence broke out in 1947. The troubled subcontinent was lurching towards a bloody partition as it split into the new independent nations of India and Pakistan. Communal violence erupted, leaving between half a million and a million people dead and displacing millions of people. Punjab was divided - western, mostly Muslim parts went to Pakistan and eastern, mainly Hindu and Sikh parts, went to India. The newly-engaged man and woman were Sikhs living in what is now Pakistan. The jacket and the briefcase were their most valuable possessions as they fled their homes to escape death as communities butchered each other in a prolonged frenzy of religious rioting. Three of Bhagwan Singh Maini's brothers had already been slaughtered in the violence, so the 30-year-old man stuffed his certificates and property claims in the fraying briefcase and fled his home in Mianwali. More than 250km (155 miles) away, in Gujranwala, Pritam Kaur's family slipped out of their house and put her on a train to Amritsar. Ms Kaur, 22, travelled across the blood-stained border with her two-year-old brother on her lap. In her bag was her most precious possession, the phulkari (embroidered) jacket, a reminder of happier days. Bhagwan Singh Maini and Pritam Kaur reunited in a food line at a refugee camp and got married Torn apart by what turned out to be one of the greatest mass migrations - or transfers of population - in human history, the two landed up in teeming refugee camps that dotted Amritsar city. They were among about 12 million people who had crossed the new borders. One day, in the food line, a miracle happened. Both Mr Maini and Ms Kaur had joined the queue of bedraggled, hungry refugees. There, they met again. ""They exchanged notes about their tragedies, wondering if it was destiny that had brought them together once more. Their families, or whatever was left of them, also reunited in due course,"" says Cookie Maini, daughter-in-law of Bhagwan Singh Maini. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is part of a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more: Special report on partition Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy In March 1948, the two got married. It was an austere ceremony; both families were struggling to pick up the pieces. Ms Kaur wore her favourite jacket. Mr Maini got together his certificates and papers from his briefcase to start a new life: he joined the judicial service in Punjab, got a small house in compensation and moved to Ludhiana with Ms Kaur. The couple had two children, who both served as civil servants. Mr Maini died some 30 years ago; Ms Kaur died in 2002. ""The jacket and the briefcase,"" says Ms Maini, ""are testimony to the life they lost and found together."" The couple reunited in line in a refugee camp at a time when millions were crossing the new borders They now survive as two of the most valuable possessions of India's fledgling Partition Museum, which opened in Amritsar in October. By early next year, the museum, housed in the magnificent and restored Town Hall, will showcase photographs, letters, audio-recordings, belongings of refugees, official documents and maps and rare newspaper clippings relating to the event. ""This will be the most comprehensive archive on the partition, and the only museum of its kind in the world,"" says Mallika Ahluwalia, chief executive officer of the two-floor, 17,000 sq ft Partition Museum. Memories of a desperate partition journey History of the 1947 partition of India,external Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir There are the stark black-and-white pictures of the never-ending caravan of Hindu and Muslim refugees, trudging wearily to what will be their new homes. Bullock carts overflow with sparse belongings and withered humans. Millions of refugees were on the move; one single convoy was reported to have stretched for 10 miles. Trains awash with the blood of murdered refugees steamed across the new borders. Too few police and soldiers were deployed to check the ensuing violence. Historian Ramachandra Guha says the ""protection of British lives was made the first priority"". Women bore the brunt of the violence: tens of thousands were abducted. Many, but not all, were eventually recovered. Tent cities sprouted all over the country to house the displaced farmers, artisans, government workers, traders and labourers. By 1950, there were some 200,000 refugees in squatter colonies in the eastern city of Calcutta alone. Refugees abandoned millions of hectares of their own farm land and many received scant compensation: a widow who lost her husband's 11,500 acres of land in two districts which went to Pakistan was given 835 acres in a village in Indian Punjab. The bloodbath continued months after the event Months after the event, the bloodbath was still continuing. The front page of a Punjab-based newspaper in October paints a picture of utter despair and anarchy in the state. Armed mobs were attacking villages, towns were plunged into darkness, there is a story about the ""moon coming to the rescue of millions"" after a power outage as well as accounts of a cholera outbreak, floods and details about millions of people stranded in refugee camps awaiting evacuation. ""Life here continues to be nightmarish,"" wrote India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1947. ""Everything seems to have gone awry"". Until you hear - and see evidence of - stories of hope and redemption, of lives lost and recovered, as in case of Bhagwan Singh Maini and Pritam Kaur. With these stories and more, the museum in Amritsar hopes to remind people of an event which author Sunil Khilnani described as ""the unspeakable sadness at the heart of the idea of India"".

"""Dad, what happens when you die?"" ""I don't know, son. Nobody knows for sure."" ""Why don't you ask Google?"" Of course, Google isn't clever enough to tell us whether there is life after death, but the word ""google"" does crop up in conversation more often than either ""clever"" or ""death"", according to researchers at the UK's University of Lancaster. It took just two decades for Google to reach this cultural ubiquity, from its humble beginnings as a student project at Stanford University in California. It is hard to remember just how bad search technology was before Google. In 1998, for example, if you typed ""cars"" into Lycos - then a leading search engine - you would get a results page filled with porn websites. Why? Owners of porn websites inserted many mentions of popular search terms such as ""cars"" in tiny text or in white on a white background. The Lycos algorithm saw many mentions of ""cars"", and concluded the page would be interesting to someone searching for ""cars"". In the Google era, this seems almost laughably simplistic. But Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not, initially, interested in designing a better way to search. Sergey Brin (L) and Larry Page (R) were trying to map the credibility of academic papers when they devised Google Their Stanford project had a more scholarly motivation. In academia, how often a published paper is cited is a measure of its credibility, and if it is cited by papers that themselves are cited many times, that bestows even more credibility. Mr Page and Mr Brin realised that if they could find a way to analyse all the links on the nascent world wide web, they could rank the credibility of each web page in any given subject. To do this, they first had to download the entire internet. This caused some consternation. It gobbled up nearly half of Stanford's bandwidth. Irate webmasters showered the university with complaints that Google's crawler was overloading their servers. Why the falling cost of light matters How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world But as Mr Page and Mr Brin refined their algorithm, it became clear they had discovered a vastly better way to search the web. Porn websites with tiny text saying ""cars cars cars"" don't get many links from other websites that discuss cars. If you searched Google for ""cars"", its analysis would be likely to yield results aboutâ¦ cars. Mr Page and Mr Brin quickly attracted investors, and Google went from student project to private company. It is now among the world's biggest, bringing in profits by the tens of billions. But for the first few years, Mr Page and Mr Brin burned through money without knowing how or if they would make it back. They were not alone. During the dotcom boom, shares in loss-making internet companies traded at absurd prices, in anticipation that they would eventually figure out viable business models. Google found its model in 2001: pay-per-click advertising. Advertisers pay Google when someone clicks through to their website, having searched for specified terms. Google displays the highest-bidders' ads alongside its ""organic"" search results. From an advertiser's perspective, the appeal is clear: you pay only when you reach people who have demonstrated an interest in your offering. It is much more efficient than paying to advertise in a newspaper. Newspapers have seen a significant decline in display advertising Even if its readership matches your target demographic, inevitably most people who see your newspaper advert won't be interested in what you are selling. No wondernewspaper advertising revenuehas fallen off a cliff. The media's scramble for new business models is one obvious economic impact of Google search. But the invention of functional search technology has created value in many ways. A few years ago,McKinsey tried to list the most important,external. One is timesaving. Studies suggest that googling is about three times as quick as finding information in a library, even discounting the time spent getting there. Likewise, finding a business online is about three times faster than using a printed directory such as the Yellow Pages. Traditional directories such as the Yellow Pages have struggled to compete with online search tools McKinsey put the productivity gains of this into the hundreds of billions. Another benefit is price transparency - economist jargon for being able to stand in a shop, take out your phone, google a product you're thinking of buying and seeing if it's available more cheaply elsewhere, then using that knowledge to haggle - annoying for the shop, helpful for the customer. Then there are ""long tail"" effects. In physical shops, it makes no sense to display aisle after aisle of obscure products that will be bought only rarely - they focus on a limited range of bestsellers instead. But a decent search facility makes it easy to find a needle in the product haystack, and that has enabled the rise of online shops offering more variety. Customers with specific desires are more likely to find exactly what they want, rather than settling for the nearest thing available in the local supermarket. And entrepreneurs can launch niche products, more confident they will find a market. This all sounds like excellent news for consumers and businesses. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. But there is a problem. Google dominates the search market, handling close to 90% of searches worldwide. Many businesses rely on ranking highly in its organic search results. And Google constantly tweaks the algorithm that decides them. Google gives general advice about how to do well, but it is not transparent about how it ranks results - not least because that would give away the information necessary to game the system. We would be back to searching for cars and getting porn. Google explains how its search works in principle but guards the details of its all-important algorithms You don't have to look far online (thanks, Google) to find business owners and search strategy consultants gnashing their teeth over the company's power to make or break them. If Google thinks you are employing tactics it considers unacceptable, it will downgrade you. One blogger complains that Google is ""judge, jury and executioner"". ""You get penalised on suspicion of breaking the rules, [and] you don't even know what the rules are,"" they say. Trying to figure out how to please Google's algorithm is rather like trying to appease an omnipotent, capricious and ultimately unknowable god. You may say as long as Google's top results are useful to searchers, it's tough luck on those who rank lower - and if those results stop being useful, then some other pair of students at Stanford will spot the gap in the market and dream up a better way. Right? Maybe - or maybe not. Search was a competitive business in the late 1990s. But now, it may be a natural monopoly - in other words, an industry that is extremely hard for a second entrant to succeed in. The reason? Among the best ways to improve the usefulness of search results is to analyse which links were ultimately clicked by people who previously performed the same search, as well as what the user has searched for before.

"The Richard Berry Building has been rebranded to a less controversial figure After years of protest, the University of Melbourne has removed the name of a controversial professor from one of its key buildings. It draws a line under an unsavoury past, writes Elissa Doherty in Melbourne. They are the skeletons in the closet of the world's most prestigious universities: buildings and statues still bearing the names of racist professors. In Australia's case, those skeletons were literally found in an anatomy department storeroom. Staff at the University of Melbourne in 2003 unearthed the bones and skulls of hundreds of people, many of them indigenous and stolen from traditional graves. It was a ghoulish symbol of the racist practices of the once-lauded Professor Richard Berry, an anatomy professor at the university from 1906 to 1929 who strove to prove Aboriginal people were not as smart as white people. The English-born academic was one of the most influential flag bearers of the eugenics movement - using genetics to ostensibly ""improve"" mankind - which was later appropriated by Nazi Germany. Prof Berry's views have been condemned in modern times An article about ""crime and degeneracy"" written by Prof Berry in 1924 He wanted to segregate and sterilise those who he felt had defective genes and even advocated a ""lethal chamber"" for the extinction of what he called ""the grosser types of our mental defectives"" in a 1930 letter to a British journal, reported local newspaperThe Age,external. The dusty skeletal remains, dubbed the Berry Collection, reflected his obsession for measuring skulls to find a correlation between head and brain size, and intelligence. But he preferred testing real people and measured thousands of ""live"" heads in his time - public and private schoolchildren, indigenous people, slum-dwellers, prostitutes, the mentally ill and those with disabilities - to support his theories. He died in 1962, aged 95. The unsavoury chapter of the university's history has resurfaced following a campaign by staff and students to have his name removed from the former anatomy building. It's just one example in a global push for universities and colleges to sever ties to racism, slavery and supremacy - and in this case it was successful. Yale University, US: The Ivy League university this year announced after years of debate and protest that it wouldchange the nameof one of its residential colleges, Calhoun College, named after slavery supporter John C. Calhoun. Georgetown, US: Student lobbyists opposed to two buildings named after university presidents involved in the sale of slaves succeeded in 2015 in having themrenamed. University of Cape Town, South Africa: A statue of Cecil Rhodes - accused of being the ""father of apartheid"" - was removed from the campus in 2015after protestsby the group #RhodesMustFall. The widely publicised movement is credited with galvanising students around the world. The esteemed sandstone university - Australia's second oldest - recently renamed the Richard Berry Building, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, to honour a less controversial figure after more than a decade of protest. Dr Ross Jones, a historian at the University of Sydney, said Prof Berry, a former dean of medicine, even argued in 1934 that 25% of the population should be sterilised to obliterate mental deficiency. The extreme views were indicative of many at the time as eugenics gained a foothold among global movers and shakers in the early 20th Century, Dr Jones said. ""You can't defend his views but he represented the views of the white middle class back then,"" he told the BBC. ""Finding the bones he had collected wasn't necessarily the issue - he was an anthropologist and many museums and universities have boxes of bones that have been used for scientific pursuits. It was the views that he held that were the problem."" An anonymous sketch of Prof Berry in Speculum, a medical students' journal Dr Jones said Prof Berry was highly respected in the state of Victoria last century, with his theories espoused in newspaper columns on a weekly basis and proving influential to politicians. While many have praised the building's changing of the guard, others like Dr Jones say history shouldn't be censored. Instead, he believes a plaque should be erected to outline both the good and the bad of the professor's legacy to ensure it isn't forgotten. In a piece on the websiteThe Conversation,external, Dr Jones wrote that the Eugenics Society of Victoria was started by a who's who of Melbourne society, and continued until 1961. ""Although Melbourne may wish to forget its dark past, the powerful leaders of the eugenics movement once controlled the city, and their beliefs influenced a generation,"" he wrote. One of the university's student agitators, Tyson Holloway-Clarke, said the institution's powers-that-be had dragged their feet. ""It's been slow progress but this is a demonstration that the university understands,"" he told The Age. Other buildings remain with the names of eugenicists, but while the University of Melbourne said there were no plans to rename other buildings, it acknowledged there was a need for a review. ""The Berry Building was renamed in response to the death in 2016 of Peter Hall, a prolific and world-renowned mathematician and statistician,"" said spokesman David Scott in a statement to the BBC. ""While the building had previously housed the Department of Anatomy, it has been home to the School of Mathematics and Statistics for a number of years, the School where Professor Hall completed his internationally-recognised work. Therefore it was appropriate to name the building to reflect its current usage.""

"It is understood Khalid Masood's phone connected with messaging app WhatsApp minutes before the attack The home secretary's broadside over encryption is only one part of a wider struggle with technology companies. The power of the companies has grown enormously in recent years and officials believe they have a responsibility to play more of a role in the fight against terrorism. Last year'srow between Apple and the FBI, in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, was ostensibly about access to a specific encrypted phone used by an attacker. But US law enforcement had long been gearing up for a battle over the issue, looking for the right moment to challenge Apple. Some suspect the UK authorities of doing the same in the wake of the Westminster attack. If there is an issue that the government wants to press the companies on though, it is the hosting of extremist content rather than encryption. It is not clear there is a problem getting hold of the communications of Khalid Masood in this case. But a wider principle is at stake, in whichgovernment is unhappy at the spread of end-to-end encryption. Companies like WhatsApp will say they are providing law enforcement with assistance but they have designed their systems with end-to-end encryption, which means they are not in a position to provide the content of any communications (although the metadata, if available, can still be very useful). In reality, the government knows that outlawing end-to-end encryption is not going to be as easy. It has justpassed new legislation in the Investigatory Powers Billand revisiting the subject seems unlikely. A further problem is that many of the tech companies are not UK-based and the government's leverage over Silicon Valley firms has its limits. The government may be hoping the new US administration will at some point make pressuring the companies a priority, but predicting when or how the Trump administration will act is not easy. Many of the new, smaller companies providing encrypted services are not based in America either. Telegram, for instance, provides encrypted communications but its founder Pavel Durov is thought to be based in Europe. Larger companies point out that if they were banned from offering end-to-end encryption then their customers (and the targets of law enforcement investigation) would simply move to these smaller providers, who, they argue, are even less likely to provide assistance to governments. They also point to all the stories about hacking and criminal theft of data as to why encryption is so valued by them and their customers. In the UK, the responsibility of companies in counter-terrorism hit the agenda whenFacebook faced criticismafter it was claimed it could have done more to spot communications by one of the men who killed Lee Rigby. That spoke to a different issue from encryption - how far should companies be monitoring the material on their sites? And when is this helping to fight terrorism and when is it spying on your own users? The tide of propaganda created by so-called Islamic Statein the last few years has pushed more attention onto what can be found on websites. Counter-terrorist officials place a high priority in restricting this content, since in their view, extremist material does not just have a radicalising effect but is directly involved in inciting acts of violence. This video can not be played Amber Rudd: ""Intelligence services need to be able to get into encrypted services like WhatsApp"" A meeting on extremist content had been previously scheduled for this Thursday, and comments by the home secretary and foreign secretary prioritised this issue (including the company Telegram again, which is seen as a distributor of content). Officials want two things from the companies - a greater prioritisation of the issue and a more proactive rather than reactive stance. YouTube says it rapidly reviews content flagged to it in order to see if it violates the company's community guidelines which prohibit things like gratuitous violence or inciting others to commit violence. But while companies maintain they do remove extremist content when it is reported to them,officials say it is not good enough. The police run a counter-terrorism internet referral unit in which officers have the difficult task of scouring extremist sites for videos of things like beheadings and then flagging them to YouTube and others for removal. Should terror police see WhatsApp chats? The companies concur with almost all of their referrals. But officials ask why it is that the police are having to do this and not the companies themselves? They point out that the companies are huge, rich enterprises full of clever people and ask why they only assign small teams to work on this subject. They want more resources both in terms of people and technology to be assigned to the task. Companies point tothe sharing of 'hashes' between platformswhich relates to material they are removing so that other companies can see if similar images are also present on their sites. They have, in the past, always stressed that such activity is not automated but subject to human review. The companies claim it is technically difficult to scan for extremist content in the same way they do for things like images that show child sex abuse. Officials say that companies that pride themselves on their cleverness should be able to find new - possibly automated - tools. But one of the concerns of companies is that they will be seen as spying on their users. Scanning everybody's posts or messages for extremist content risks making them look intrusive. The reality is, though, that they already scan and mine their user's data for advertising since that is primarily how companies Google and Facebook make their profits. Butthe Edward Snowden revelationshighlighted that co-operation with governments can lead to a backlash. The companies additionally are increasingly global rather than national. They fear precedents being set in one country being used in others. What if other countries also demand extremist content is taken down but define extremist in a different way - perhaps targeting domestic political opposition? China poses a particular dilemma for the tech companies. Apple is in the China market but it is not entirely clear what kind of data it provides to the state. Facebook is keen to get in. Edward Snowden, a former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence Although they have not ruled it out, politicians in the UK know that legislation is unlikely to be the answer to these problems. Their best bet is try to put pressure on the companies through public opinion since they are the users the companies rely on. This tussle has been going on for years but the balance has been shifting in recent months. The fact that they havenot paid much taxhas helped turn public opinion against companies. Recent revelations thatthey have placed advertising next to extremist contenthas also put them on the back foot. The companies say they are not complacent and have indicated they are willing to be more proactive and use technology in new ways. But they also will know that the pressure is mounting.

"Fernando Alonso: ""We are McLaren-Honda. If we are not in the top five, on the podium, the rest is losing time."" Not for the first time time, McLaren-Honda had reason to be grateful to Fernando Alonso at the Australian Grand Prix. Until a late-race car problem forced him to retire, the Spaniard was on course to secure an unlikely point for a team that, even some insiders will admit privately, is in crisis at the start of the 2017 Formula 1 season. Pre-season testing had gone so badly for McLaren that it looked like they would struggle not to be on the back of the grid. After some hasty work on reliability by Honda and improvements to the car,Alonso qualified 13th. For much of the race in Melbourne, he was in 10th place, valiantly holding off Esteban Ocon's Force India, which had a 27km/h advantage on the straight. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier described Alonso's drive as ""prodigiously impressive"". The same could be said of many of his races in an under-powered McLaren over the last two years - such as his fifth places in Monaco and the USA last year, or his drive to seventh from last on the grid in Belgium. Results that helped McLaren secure sixth place in the championship. In two separate news conferences over the weekend, Lewis Hamilton expressed his regret that Alonso was not racing at the front, saying he ""deserved it"", as one of the best drivers on the grid. As Hamilton said: ""It would be great to have Fernando up there but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon."" Indeed it doesn't. While Alonso's achievements at Albert Park amount to positive progress in the context of McLaren-Honda's dire pre-season, they are a long way from the ambitions of this once-great team and its still-great number one driver. Alonso expects big change in his team Vettel beats Hamilton to win Australia GP 5 live: Australia GP review Stoffel Vandoorne finished 13th in Australia This was the year the McLaren-Honda alliance was supposed to finally hit its stride after two difficult seasons. Alonso spent much of last year saying how the change in regulations gave McLaren a chance to close the gap on Mercedes, and Honda promised it would make a big step forward with its engine. Even as recently asthe launch of the McLaren car in late February,Honda F1 boss Yusuke Hasegawa was expressing his hope that the redesigned Honda engine would match the performance of Mercedes' 2016 power-unit by the start of the season. It has not worked out that way. Pre-season testing was beset by difficulties, Honda getting through at least five engines in the course of eight days. Alonso said the engine had ""no power and no reliability"". There were several problems, but a couple of fundamental ones: a major vibration that was either breaking the engine, or damaging ancillaries enough to make it shut down; and less power than last year's engine. Informed estimates put its deficit to the new Mercedes engine at somewhere between 120-160bhp. The vibration problem is severe enough that Honda should, in one way, be applauded for the progress it made in enabling Alonso, at least, to run a pretty much normal weekend. The same could not be said for his new team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne, but that's another story. But while the engine ran relatively reliably, it still badly lacked performance, and it is clear that patience is running out, the partnership close to breaking point. Fernando Alonso returned to McLaren in 2015, having raced for them in 2007 While expressing the need for improvement, Alonso was mostly sanguine about the situation in his public appearances over the course of the weekend. But there were still glimpses behind the mask. He sat stony faced in the team's post-qualifying news conference, until the question of how he motivated himself to go through another season like this was brought up. Where's your head at, he was asked? ""I expect a big change in the team, a big reaction,"" he said. ""We will not be 13th all season. Or I will not be."" The message was clear. Sort it out, or I'm off. McLaren have had two difficult seasons since the start of their relationship with Honda in 2015 The big question is what happens next. BBC Sport revealed two weeks ago that McLaren had made an initial approach to Mercedes about a potential engine supply in the wake of theproblems in testing.This despite a ""multi-year contract"" with Honda. It was notable at the Australian Grand Prix that when asked about this development, McLaren racing director Eric Boullier neither denied it, nor made any attempt to play down the potential of the team splitting with Honda. ""Obviously we are looking at every option to recover and catch up,"" Boullier said, ""because we are definitely not in the position that we were expecting to be and we want to be."" Hasegawa admitted: ""We are having a strong pressure from the team and from the drivers. We try to keep improving."" McLaren-Honda expected a big step forward this year after finishing sixth in the constructors' championship last season Self-evidently, McLaren'sdecision to talk to Mercedes,even if only briefly, means the team's senior management are considering whether they should try to get out of their contract with Honda. Which means they must have doubts about whether the Japanese motor giant will ever be able to provide a competitive engine during the life of their partnership. Honda contribute something in the region of $70m a year and free engines to McLaren - close to a net $90-100m when the cost of buying a customer engine is added. Asked how it felt about the team talking to a rival, Hasegawa said: ""This is just a rumour."" Challenged that it was a fact, he said: ""I don't know. I don't care about that. The thing we have to do is keep concentrating."" On the subject of potentially changing engines, Boullier said: ""I am not going to comment on these kind of discussions. It is a private discussion we have with Honda to recover, considering all options. ""We are responsible for McLaren and Hasegawa-san is responsible for Honda. As partners we try to help each other and support each other because the key secret is to be as integrated as possible."" His answer did little to diminish the belief that McLaren are at least considering trying to find a way out of their contract with Honda. The question is why they would think that was a good idea. On the face of it, it sounds like one. On a simplistic level, it would seem logical that if a Mercedes engine was plugged into a McLaren, the car would be much more competitive. Boullier claimed during winter testing that McLaren would win if it had a Mercedes engine. On a simple calculation of the minimum power deficit, a Mercedes engine might potentially make the McLaren in the region of two seconds quicker. Alonso was 3.2 seconds off the pace in qualifying. So changing might - at best - put McLaren about sixth or so on the grid. But there are wider considerations than that. For a start, where would the missing money come from? McLaren are run by very rich men - the Bahraini royal family is a 50% shareholder and 25% shareholder Mansour Ojjeh is a billionaire. They could easily fund the shortfall if they wanted to - but that situation is sustainable for only so long. McLaren's new executive director Zak Brown is the best sponsor-finder in the paddock. But in a difficult market, finding income worth $70m a year for a team struggling to score a point, even if he can sell it on the idea of switching to Mercedes is not going to be easy. Beyond that, customer Mercedes engines is not a long-term strategy. Red Bull buck the trend, but it is widely accepted in F1 that if a team wants to win the title, it has to have a works engine partnership. And no other Mercedes customer team are close to the factory outfit's performance, despite the regulatory requirement to provide identical engines. That's because F1 cars are complex pieces of machinery. The Mercedes car is designed around the Mercedes engine, which is built after conversations between the two arms of the team. The customers get what they are given and do not have the same opportunity for integration. Then there is the question of how McLaren would get out of its Honda contract. Honda is showing no signs of wanting to quit. It sees F1 as a long-term project. If McLaren sought a way out, Honda might acquiesce. But the company would be highly unlikely to pay any money in the form of compensation. It might even take offence, and sue McLaren. A case Honda has vastly more resources to fight than the team. Once out of its Honda contract, McLaren would then need to look for another works engine partner. Yet not only are no other car companies expressing an interest in F1, but any approached would surely look at the way McLaren have treated Honda and wonder whether they were a team with which it was wise to get involved. Fernando Alonso qualified 13th for the season-opener in Australia The perceived risk in persevering with Honda is that it might never manage to produce a competitive engine, and that by the time it realises this and pulls out of F1, McLaren will be in such dire straits that the company would be on its knees. But McLaren already have a relatively limited sponsor portfolio, with Honda providing the bulk of their income beyond official prize money. And if Honda did quit in, say, three years' time, the rules mean that one of the remaining engine companies would be obliged to supply McLaren then - so it is arguable they would be no worse off than they are now. The alternative ending is that McLaren use this situation as an opportunity. They can hope that their public flirting with Mercedes wakes Honda up to the need to do a better job. They could apologise privately, express their commitment to the partnership's success, and offer to work ever more closely together with Honda reach the standards required. And they could redouble their collective efforts to making it so. Whether Alonso would hang around in that scenario is another question. But, brilliant though he is as a grand prix driver, McLaren have much bigger problems than that right now. The Bahrainis, Ojjeh and Brown have some serious thinking to do. And any decision they make requires wisdom and long-term strategy, not short-term tactical opportunism.

"This video can not be played T20 tournament 'future-proofs' county game - ECB chief tells BBC's Dan Roan A new eight-team, city-based Twenty20 tournament could ""absolutely rival the Indian Premier League"" says England and Wales Cricket Board chief Tom Harrison. The competition, proposed to begin in 2020, moved a step closer on Monday as further details were revealed. ECB chief executive Harrison said it was ""not a gamble"" for the 18 first-class counties. ""What we are doing here is future-proofing county cricket,"" Harrison told BBC sports editor Dan Roan. ""I don't think it's so much a gamble, it's about saying, 'What do we want our business and our game to look like?'"" The IPL - and Australia's Big Bash tournament - enjoy huge success, attracting the world's best limited-overs players and drawing large crowds. A referendum is expected to be dispatched on Tuesday inviting stakeholders to sanction a tournament including eight teams, rather than the 18 counties who traditionally contest the main competitions domestically. On Monday, the ECB presented a detailed overview of its proposals for a new Twenty20 competition to its 41 members. These included: Eight new teams playing 36 games over a 38-day summer window, with four home games per team All games televised, with significant free-to-air exposure No scheduling overlap with the existing T20 Blast competition An Indian Premier League-style play-off system to give more incentive for finishing higher up the league A players' draft, with squads of 15 including three overseas players Counties guaranteed Â£1.3m It says cricket has the chance to be part of ""mainstream conversation"" and believes the new competition can make the sport ""relevant to a whole new audience"". Following a period of consultation including more than 10,000 interviews, the ECB decided on three key principles: To have a major positive impact on driving participation To focus on recruiting the next generation of fans, in particular promoting attendance to a diverse, young, family audience To ensure complete differentiation from existing cricket tournaments to protect and support the future of the county game ""What we absolutely need to do, is start appealing to a younger audience,"" said Harrison. ""We know that by doing things differently, by building new teams, we can be relevant to a whole new audience and bring this very diverse, multicultural Britain in to our stadiums in a way perhaps we haven't been successful in doing."" This will be the first time in the history of domestic cricket that first-class counties are not represented, hence the need for a change to the ECB's articles and constitutions. It was confirmed on Monday that all 18 clubs have signed ""media rights deeds"" to allow the governing body to include the new Twenty20 in their forthcoming broadcast portfolio. Asked if the move to a city-based format signalled the end of the county system, Harrison said: ""Not at all. I think what we are doing here is future-proofing county cricket. ""Cricket has been a sport which has always had the ability to evolve and change where it's needed to, and its shown itself to be incredibly adaptable. ""We are the sport which came up with short formats through T20, and other sports have been trying to find the T20 equivalent of their own. ""So we have demonstrated we are capable of it, we've got the format, we now just need to create the competition which enables these new fans to get involved. ""It's a hugely exciting moment."" Chris Gayle has spent the past two Twenty20 Blast seasons with Somerset The ECB says the proposed competition can rival the incredible success of the Indian Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, whichdraws average crowds of more than 28,000.,external Questions remain around where the tournament will fit into the schedule, and which of the world's best players will be available. The ECB insists it will not impact on the T20 Blast, which last season featured the likes of West Indies star Chris Gayle and New Zealand's Brendon McCullum. ""We think there's a lot of room for growth in the Blast,"" said Harrison. ""It's done a tremendous job at bringing in a county cricket audience. ""But the evidence we have suggest cricket exists in a bubble and we've got to get outside this bubble."" The ECB's aim for ""significant"" free-to-air coverage is an ""aspiration which reaches at the heart of our proposition going forward"", according to Harrison. ""We are hoping very much as part of that is a whole new calibration of our reach, so a whole new way of looking at access to our sport whether that's digitally whether it's through social media or whether it's through traditional TV channels,"" he added. ""But we also understand it has to be the right mix of revenue and reach and promotion of the game which is ultimately what we're searching for."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Radio 5 live Cricket needs that moment in this country that changes the way we talk and think about the game. It's got to be good for the game. The key to the Big Bash is being seen. Every single person in Australia can see every single ball. Cricket is now the number one sport in Australia. Where the Big Bash has had huge success is they make sure the fan experience is key, and almost the cricket is secondary. The fans, and it's about 50-50 between men and women, and the kids, they all go home having had a great time. The only thing in terms of a county perspective is this new tournament will be a massive juggernaut, get loads of marketing and the county game may say: 'Why didn't we get that support?' This board of the ECB, I feel, are very visionary. You are going to get some terrific teams. I believe it will be a roaring success. England Test captain Joe Root on BBC Radio 5 live It would make a huge difference. I think it's very important that the public are given an opportunity to see cricket on a national level on free to air TV so it will be interesting to see how things pan out and what decisions are made. I think it's a very good idea. It's great to see it's been given some thought. You look at other competitions around the world and they've been very successful so we'll wait to see what happens in the coming months.

"Fernando Alonso: ""We are McLaren-Honda. If we are not in the top five, on the podium, the rest is losing time."" Not for the first time time, McLaren-Honda had reason to be grateful to Fernando Alonso at the Australian Grand Prix. Until a late-race car problem forced him to retire, the Spaniard was on course to secure an unlikely point for a team that, even some insiders will admit privately, is in crisis at the start of the 2017 Formula 1 season. Pre-season testing had gone so badly for McLaren that it looked like they would struggle not to be on the back of the grid. After some hasty work on reliability by Honda and improvements to the car,Alonso qualified 13th. For much of the race in Melbourne, he was in 10th place, valiantly holding off Esteban Ocon's Force India, which had a 27km/h advantage on the straight. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier described Alonso's drive as ""prodigiously impressive"". The same could be said of many of his races in an under-powered McLaren over the last two years - such as his fifth places in Monaco and the USA last year, or his drive to seventh from last on the grid in Belgium. Results that helped McLaren secure sixth place in the championship. In two separate news conferences over the weekend, Lewis Hamilton expressed his regret that Alonso was not racing at the front, saying he ""deserved it"", as one of the best drivers on the grid. As Hamilton said: ""It would be great to have Fernando up there but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon."" Indeed it doesn't. While Alonso's achievements at Albert Park amount to positive progress in the context of McLaren-Honda's dire pre-season, they are a long way from the ambitions of this once-great team and its still-great number one driver. Alonso expects big change in his team Vettel beats Hamilton to win Australia GP 5 live: Australia GP review Stoffel Vandoorne finished 13th in Australia This was the year the McLaren-Honda alliance was supposed to finally hit its stride after two difficult seasons. Alonso spent much of last year saying how the change in regulations gave McLaren a chance to close the gap on Mercedes, and Honda promised it would make a big step forward with its engine. Even as recently asthe launch of the McLaren car in late February,Honda F1 boss Yusuke Hasegawa was expressing his hope that the redesigned Honda engine would match the performance of Mercedes' 2016 power-unit by the start of the season. It has not worked out that way. Pre-season testing was beset by difficulties, Honda getting through at least five engines in the course of eight days. Alonso said the engine had ""no power and no reliability"". There were several problems, but a couple of fundamental ones: a major vibration that was either breaking the engine, or damaging ancillaries enough to make it shut down; and less power than last year's engine. Informed estimates put its deficit to the new Mercedes engine at somewhere between 120-160bhp. The vibration problem is severe enough that Honda should, in one way, be applauded for the progress it made in enabling Alonso, at least, to run a pretty much normal weekend. The same could not be said for his new team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne, but that's another story. But while the engine ran relatively reliably, it still badly lacked performance, and it is clear that patience is running out, the partnership close to breaking point. Fernando Alonso returned to McLaren in 2015, having raced for them in 2007 While expressing the need for improvement, Alonso was mostly sanguine about the situation in his public appearances over the course of the weekend. But there were still glimpses behind the mask. He sat stony faced in the team's post-qualifying news conference, until the question of how he motivated himself to go through another season like this was brought up. Where's your head at, he was asked? ""I expect a big change in the team, a big reaction,"" he said. ""We will not be 13th all season. Or I will not be."" The message was clear. Sort it out, or I'm off. McLaren have had two difficult seasons since the start of their relationship with Honda in 2015 The big question is what happens next. BBC Sport revealed two weeks ago that McLaren had made an initial approach to Mercedes about a potential engine supply in the wake of theproblems in testing.This despite a ""multi-year contract"" with Honda. It was notable at the Australian Grand Prix that when asked about this development, McLaren racing director Eric Boullier neither denied it, nor made any attempt to play down the potential of the team splitting with Honda. ""Obviously we are looking at every option to recover and catch up,"" Boullier said, ""because we are definitely not in the position that we were expecting to be and we want to be."" Hasegawa admitted: ""We are having a strong pressure from the team and from the drivers. We try to keep improving."" McLaren-Honda expected a big step forward this year after finishing sixth in the constructors' championship last season Self-evidently, McLaren'sdecision to talk to Mercedes,even if only briefly, means the team's senior management are considering whether they should try to get out of their contract with Honda. Which means they must have doubts about whether the Japanese motor giant will ever be able to provide a competitive engine during the life of their partnership. Honda contribute something in the region of $70m a year and free engines to McLaren - close to a net $90-100m when the cost of buying a customer engine is added. Asked how it felt about the team talking to a rival, Hasegawa said: ""This is just a rumour."" Challenged that it was a fact, he said: ""I don't know. I don't care about that. The thing we have to do is keep concentrating."" On the subject of potentially changing engines, Boullier said: ""I am not going to comment on these kind of discussions. It is a private discussion we have with Honda to recover, considering all options. ""We are responsible for McLaren and Hasegawa-san is responsible for Honda. As partners we try to help each other and support each other because the key secret is to be as integrated as possible."" His answer did little to diminish the belief that McLaren are at least considering trying to find a way out of their contract with Honda. The question is why they would think that was a good idea. On the face of it, it sounds like one. On a simplistic level, it would seem logical that if a Mercedes engine was plugged into a McLaren, the car would be much more competitive. Boullier claimed during winter testing that McLaren would win if it had a Mercedes engine. On a simple calculation of the minimum power deficit, a Mercedes engine might potentially make the McLaren in the region of two seconds quicker. Alonso was 3.2 seconds off the pace in qualifying. So changing might - at best - put McLaren about sixth or so on the grid. But there are wider considerations than that. For a start, where would the missing money come from? McLaren are run by very rich men - the Bahraini royal family is a 50% shareholder and 25% shareholder Mansour Ojjeh is a billionaire. They could easily fund the shortfall if they wanted to - but that situation is sustainable for only so long. McLaren's new executive director Zak Brown is the best sponsor-finder in the paddock. But in a difficult market, finding income worth $70m a year for a team struggling to score a point, even if he can sell it on the idea of switching to Mercedes is not going to be easy. Beyond that, customer Mercedes engines is not a long-term strategy. Red Bull buck the trend, but it is widely accepted in F1 that if a team wants to win the title, it has to have a works engine partnership. And no other Mercedes customer team are close to the factory outfit's performance, despite the regulatory requirement to provide identical engines. That's because F1 cars are complex pieces of machinery. The Mercedes car is designed around the Mercedes engine, which is built after conversations between the two arms of the team. The customers get what they are given and do not have the same opportunity for integration. Then there is the question of how McLaren would get out of its Honda contract. Honda is showing no signs of wanting to quit. It sees F1 as a long-term project. If McLaren sought a way out, Honda might acquiesce. But the company would be highly unlikely to pay any money in the form of compensation. It might even take offence, and sue McLaren. A case Honda has vastly more resources to fight than the team. Once out of its Honda contract, McLaren would then need to look for another works engine partner. Yet not only are no other car companies expressing an interest in F1, but any approached would surely look at the way McLaren have treated Honda and wonder whether they were a team with which it was wise to get involved. Fernando Alonso qualified 13th for the season-opener in Australia The perceived risk in persevering with Honda is that it might never manage to produce a competitive engine, and that by the time it realises this and pulls out of F1, McLaren will be in such dire straits that the company would be on its knees. But McLaren already have a relatively limited sponsor portfolio, with Honda providing the bulk of their income beyond official prize money. And if Honda did quit in, say, three years' time, the rules mean that one of the remaining engine companies would be obliged to supply McLaren then - so it is arguable they would be no worse off than they are now. The alternative ending is that McLaren use this situation as an opportunity. They can hope that their public flirting with Mercedes wakes Honda up to the need to do a better job. They could apologise privately, express their commitment to the partnership's success, and offer to work ever more closely together with Honda reach the standards required. And they could redouble their collective efforts to making it so. Whether Alonso would hang around in that scenario is another question. But, brilliant though he is as a grand prix driver, McLaren have much bigger problems than that right now. The Bahrainis, Ojjeh and Brown have some serious thinking to do. And any decision they make requires wisdom and long-term strategy, not short-term tactical opportunism.

"This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand opens up about his wife's death Former England captain Rio Ferdinand has told the BBC that his children would not talk about the death of their mother. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he said his children would ""shut me down"" when he asked them how they were feeling. He said he did not know the best way to talk to his three children, now aged 10, eight and five. Ferdinand's wife, Rebecca, was 34 when she died of breast cancer in May 2015. The couple got married in 2009. The ex-Manchester Utd defender was speaking to 5 live ahead of a BBC One documentary about grief on Tuesday at 21:00 BST. He told 5 live's Emma Barnett: ""I didn't know any techniques to speak to the children. I didn't know what buttons to push. ""I'd been starting conversations with them to try and get how they were feeling out, and they would just shut me down, walk away, close the conversation down completely."" In the BBC One programme, Ferdinand starts a memory jar for the family, enabling the children to talk about the happy moments when their mum was alive. He said: ""It kind of opened everything up and it was a beautiful moment just seeing them talk happily and being joyful about their mum rather than it being sad and negative moments. ""It switched it from dark to bright."" Ferdinand also said that,in the wake of Rebecca's death, he now understands why people contemplate suicide. He told 5 live: ""When you come into this situation you understand suicide, you understand people who do that and have those thoughts. ""I didn't think about it myself but I understand now how people get to that situation. ""I can't judge people like that now, whereas before I'd be sitting there, probably with Rebecca, saying that guy is so ignorant and selfish how has he just done that - left three beautiful kids. ""Now I could say I understand how he got to that point. I wouldn't do it, but I understand how he's there. You do get to those levels - and so it's a work-in-progress. Rio Ferdinand and Rebecca Ellison got married in 2009 Ferdinand said: ""At the beginning I'd sit and think how am I ever going to be happy? ""I can't see a point where I'm ever going to be able to smile, because I can get happy over here, but then I look at my children - and that brings you right back into sadness again because they haven't got a mum."" Throughout Tuesday's programme, he meets other widowers and talks to them about rebuilding a life and moving on. But he would not be drawn on his own relationships, saying he was ""disappointed"" that there had been speculation about his private life, after recent photos in a tabloid newspaper linked him with a reality TV star. He told 5 live: ""That's disappointing... protecting my children is always the biggest thing for me... and that's what I'm fearful of with things being in the press. ""But the documentary has taught me there isn't a right time for anything like that, for if you're going to move on in a relationship... there is no right time. ""The only person who knows the right time is the person in those shoes. I've never spoken about my relationships in the past, in the public eye, and I'm not going to start talking about relationships or potential relationships that people are reporting on."" Commenting on how long it takes to recover from bereavement, Ferdinand said the government was ""wrong"" to cut back on the length of time widowed parents can receive a benefit. Ferdinand retired from football at the age of 36 in May 2015, the same month his wife died Changes mean that from 6 April 2017, bereaved parents will only receive payments for 18 months. Previously, the payment lasted until children were 16 years old. He said: ""If I'm honest, I don't understand how the government can actually say there's a timescale on it because there is no timescale on anything to do with bereavement - every individual is different. ""One person may take six months another person may take 10 years. There isn't a time when you can say, 'Yeah I'm over it'.  Putting a number on it is the wrong thing to do."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the Bereavement Support Scheme was designed to help protect families from sudden financial difficulties. He said: ""We are updating an old system that was based on the outdated assumption that a widowed parent relied on their spouse for income, and would never work themselves. This does not reflect people's lives today. He added: ""Once the payments come to an end, there are means-tested benefits which can continue to support the bereaved, especially those who are bringing up children. ""The new payment is easier to claim, won't be taxed and does not affect the amount received from other benefits, helping those on the lowest incomes the most.""

"Before the war: Mai (left) and her sister look out across the Sanaa skyline in 2009 It is two years since the start of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen in support of the government ousted by Houthi rebels. In that time, thousands of civilians have been killed, parts of the country devastated and Yemen left teetering on the brink of famine. Here the BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to film short documentaries, reflects on what has become of her country. It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home. A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check. Beside the physical destruction, memories of what once was are buried under the heavy weight of emotional rubble. Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have had to monitor every twist and turn of the civil war in my country, even when I wanted to look away. Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the furious conflict in Yemen has terrified me. But living through the war from outside Yemen was isolating. As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a rugged 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly broke down after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often. This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country divided by more than mere miles. In simple terms, the south is under government control, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the north is controlled by the Houthi rebels. But the reality is more complicated. I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found. Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be at a standstill, waiting in fearful anticipation of more fighting, Sanaa - apart from the obvious damage - appears the same as ever. Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have escaped unscathed I can feel the rain approaching. After London that should make me shudder, but it somehow feels welcoming. The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly fill with clouds transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of misted rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home. The Yemeni capital has suffered like other parts of the country, but life there goes on There are more restaurants in town than I recall, and many are over-flowing with people. For a moment I forget there's a war raging across the country. But then Sanaa can be deceptive. I feel exhausted by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house. I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very determinedly. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me. Mai's aunt's car sits where it was hit by a falling missile in the garden of her home It's quite quiet here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the narrow stairs at the back of the house. We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed. ""You're still you,"" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too short or the few extra pounds I've gained. Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has changed, she's gone through a lot in the last few years. Three years ago she lost her father suddenly. She had been very close to him and facing life without him, amid ongoing uncertainty, is hard. ""He was the biggest support I had,"" she tells me, breaking down in tears. Life hasn't been kind to her and the war has now brought with it seemingly endless questions. Would her family be able to leave if it had to? Is it better to be stuck inside surrounded by conflict, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children safe at school or sleeping in their beds? How many more funerals will she have to attend? I have no answers. Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so bleak. Our lives have become more different than ever. Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of separation, loss and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together. But something else weighs heavily on my heart. There is one place I wasn't able to visit. It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind. My grandmother's house in Taiz. But sadly my grandmother is no longer with us and Taiz today is unrecognisable, sitting as it does on the frontline of the conflict. I wonder if I'd even know the house. The fighting on the ground is brutal, the bombardment by the Saudi-led coalition is relentless and the siege on the city by the Houthis continues. It's painful trying to accept the way things have become, one where precious memories have no place among the hardship of this grinding conflict. To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing harder than losing one's home. When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of dread and trepidation at what I might find after years of bombardment and fighting. On arriving I fell into a false sense of relief that the people were still here; home was, in some form, still here. In the days which followed though, it became clear that war damage isn't just the craters and the bombed out buildings. It is the suffering of a population watching helplessly as their lives are being torn apart.

"Spare a thought for those who are bestowed with troublesome names. That can happen anywhere, of course. But, in Zambia, Chris Haslam came across some very surprising choices. Under a darkening sky on a dusty, potholed track in eastern Zambia, a small boy is struggling to push a large, Chinese bicycle. Its handlebars, crossbar and panniers are stacked impossibly high with yellow jerry cans, firewood and a sack of rice. Because the boy needs both hands to keep the bike upright, he can't sweep the flies from his eyes. But this seven-year-old is labouring under a much heavier, but less visible burden. His name is Mulangani. It's a Nguni word meaning ""punish me"". Or ""he who must be punished"", if you want to get formal. Who, I asked my driver Mavuto, would give their child such a horrible name? ""Maybe his grandfather, maybe the chief,"" he shrugged, explaining that across Zambia and neighbouring Zimbabwe, it is common for parents, especially in rural areas, to invite community elders to choose the name of a newborn. ""Sometimes the chief wants to punish the family,"" says Mavuto. ""Or he may think this new child is too much for the family to bear."" Watching the boy's Sisyphean progress towards his distant home, that name suddenly seems disturbingly apt, but he's not the only one cursed with a dismal name. In later days, I meet Chilumba - ""my brother's grave"", Balaudye - ""I will be eaten"", Soca - ""bad luck"" and Chakufwa - ""it is dead"". I also meet Daliso, whose name means ""blessings"" and Chikondi, which means ""love"". Maybe it's me, but they do seem happier. ""In African culture, there is a trend of naming children according to the circumstances surrounding their birth,"" says Clare Mulkenga-Chilambo, a care worker at SOS Children's Villages in Zambia. ""It's good for those born at bright and merry moments but unfortunate for the others."" And there are a lot of others. HIV and Aids have ravaged Zambia, and although infection rates are now falling, 55,000 adults and 5,000 kids became infected in 2015. Countrywide, an estimated 380,000 children have been orphaned by Aids and 85,000 are living with HIV. Ask Massiye, or ""orphan"", or Chisonis - ""sadness"", or the sad-eyed Chimwamsozi, whose name means ""drinker of tears"". Or nine-year-old Komasi, whose name means ""kill him"", and his little brother Komaniso, aka ""kill him also"". ""Most Zambians have several names,"" says Kangachepe Banda. His name means ""well off"" or ""richness"", and as a safari guide he's doing OK. ""You're talking about the first one. It's called thezina la bamkombo- or the name of the umbilical cord. After a birth, the mother and child hide away until the cord drops off. On that day, the baby is presented to family and neighbours, and the person honoured with choosing the name makes his decision."" Use of this name is supposed to be limited. It's supposed to be kept between the namer and the named - a dark reminder to the growing child that one person saw into his or her soul at birth. The church, says Clare Mulenga-Chilambo, offers deliverance. ""Most people turn to Christianity and on baptism, they are given Christian names,"" she says. ""This gives them the opportunity to give up their traditional name, which is often seen as the cause of whatever misfortune they could have been facing in their lives"". But there are some here who see opting for the homogenised anonymity of John, James or Mary as a dereliction of tradition. Others feel that the names must be kept not just out of respect to elders but also as a guarantee of ancestral protection. If the name maketh the man, then surely Zambia's notoriously grim prisons are full of unfortunates who've been saddled with names like Chidano, Mapenzi and Chananga - that's  ""hatred"", ""trouble"" and ""wrongdoer"" respectively? ""It's possible,"" concurs Muvato. Growing up, he knew a kid called Chiheni, which translates as bad boy, or thug. ""He ran away from home when he was 12,"" he says. ""He is in prison in South Africa for the attempted murder of a security guard.""

It's a tin-roofed hut with a neat vegetable patch patrolled by bickering chickens and a dog called Imbwa. Which means ""dog"". Sometime soon, says Mulangani, I'm going to be baptised. My new name will be Emanuel. It means God is with me. He smiles. He likes Emanuel. As we drive away, there's a storm brewing in the west. The potholes are getting deeper and the clutch is playing up. As the first fat raindrops splatter the dusty windscreen, it suddenly strikes me that I haven't asked Mavuto whathisname means. He grimaces as he struggles to find third gear.

"""Dad, what happens when you die?"" ""I don't know, son. Nobody knows for sure."" ""Why don't you ask Google?"" Of course, Google isn't clever enough to tell us whether there is life after death, but the word ""google"" does crop up in conversation more often than either ""clever"" or ""death"", according to researchers at the UK's University of Lancaster. It took just two decades for Google to reach this cultural ubiquity, from its humble beginnings as a student project at Stanford University in California. It is hard to remember just how bad search technology was before Google. In 1998, for example, if you typed ""cars"" into Lycos - then a leading search engine - you would get a results page filled with porn websites. Why? Owners of porn websites inserted many mentions of popular search terms such as ""cars"" in tiny text or in white on a white background. The Lycos algorithm saw many mentions of ""cars"", and concluded the page would be interesting to someone searching for ""cars"". In the Google era, this seems almost laughably simplistic. But Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not, initially, interested in designing a better way to search. Sergey Brin (L) and Larry Page (R) were trying to map the credibility of academic papers when they devised Google Their Stanford project had a more scholarly motivation. In academia, how often a published paper is cited is a measure of its credibility, and if it is cited by papers that themselves are cited many times, that bestows even more credibility. Mr Page and Mr Brin realised that if they could find a way to analyse all the links on the nascent world wide web, they could rank the credibility of each web page in any given subject. To do this, they first had to download the entire internet. This caused some consternation. It gobbled up nearly half of Stanford's bandwidth. Irate webmasters showered the university with complaints that Google's crawler was overloading their servers. Why the falling cost of light matters How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world But as Mr Page and Mr Brin refined their algorithm, it became clear they had discovered a vastly better way to search the web. Porn websites with tiny text saying ""cars cars cars"" don't get many links from other websites that discuss cars. If you searched Google for ""cars"", its analysis would be likely to yield results aboutâ¦ cars. Mr Page and Mr Brin quickly attracted investors, and Google went from student project to private company. It is now among the world's biggest, bringing in profits by the tens of billions. But for the first few years, Mr Page and Mr Brin burned through money without knowing how or if they would make it back. They were not alone. During the dotcom boom, shares in loss-making internet companies traded at absurd prices, in anticipation that they would eventually figure out viable business models. Google found its model in 2001: pay-per-click advertising. Advertisers pay Google when someone clicks through to their website, having searched for specified terms. Google displays the highest-bidders' ads alongside its ""organic"" search results. From an advertiser's perspective, the appeal is clear: you pay only when you reach people who have demonstrated an interest in your offering. It is much more efficient than paying to advertise in a newspaper. Newspapers have seen a significant decline in display advertising Even if its readership matches your target demographic, inevitably most people who see your newspaper advert won't be interested in what you are selling. No wondernewspaper advertising revenuehas fallen off a cliff. The media's scramble for new business models is one obvious economic impact of Google search. But the invention of functional search technology has created value in many ways. A few years ago,McKinsey tried to list the most important,external. One is timesaving. Studies suggest that googling is about three times as quick as finding information in a library, even discounting the time spent getting there. Likewise, finding a business online is about three times faster than using a printed directory such as the Yellow Pages. Traditional directories such as the Yellow Pages have struggled to compete with online search tools McKinsey put the productivity gains of this into the hundreds of billions. Another benefit is price transparency - economist jargon for being able to stand in a shop, take out your phone, google a product you're thinking of buying and seeing if it's available more cheaply elsewhere, then using that knowledge to haggle - annoying for the shop, helpful for the customer. Then there are ""long tail"" effects. In physical shops, it makes no sense to display aisle after aisle of obscure products that will be bought only rarely - they focus on a limited range of bestsellers instead. But a decent search facility makes it easy to find a needle in the product haystack, and that has enabled the rise of online shops offering more variety. Customers with specific desires are more likely to find exactly what they want, rather than settling for the nearest thing available in the local supermarket. And entrepreneurs can launch niche products, more confident they will find a market. This all sounds like excellent news for consumers and businesses. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. But there is a problem. Google dominates the search market, handling close to 90% of searches worldwide. Many businesses rely on ranking highly in its organic search results. And Google constantly tweaks the algorithm that decides them. Google gives general advice about how to do well, but it is not transparent about how it ranks results - not least because that would give away the information necessary to game the system. We would be back to searching for cars and getting porn. Google explains how its search works in principle but guards the details of its all-important algorithms You don't have to look far online (thanks, Google) to find business owners and search strategy consultants gnashing their teeth over the company's power to make or break them. If Google thinks you are employing tactics it considers unacceptable, it will downgrade you. One blogger complains that Google is ""judge, jury and executioner"". ""You get penalised on suspicion of breaking the rules, [and] you don't even know what the rules are,"" they say. Trying to figure out how to please Google's algorithm is rather like trying to appease an omnipotent, capricious and ultimately unknowable god. You may say as long as Google's top results are useful to searchers, it's tough luck on those who rank lower - and if those results stop being useful, then some other pair of students at Stanford will spot the gap in the market and dream up a better way. Right? Maybe - or maybe not. Search was a competitive business in the late 1990s. But now, it may be a natural monopoly - in other words, an industry that is extremely hard for a second entrant to succeed in. The reason? Among the best ways to improve the usefulness of search results is to analyse which links were ultimately clicked by people who previously performed the same search, as well as what the user has searched for before. Google has far more of that data than anyone else. That suggests the company may continue to shape our access to knowledge for generations to come.
