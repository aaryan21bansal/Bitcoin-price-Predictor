"Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis since he came to power on 1 January 2019 Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the heads of the army, navy and air force all quit and the country recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The unprecedented resignation of the defence chiefs is being seen as a protest at attempts by Mr Bolsonaro to exert undue control over the military. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to Covid-19. Nearly 314,000 people have died, with a new daily record of 3,780 on Tuesday. Worldwide, Brazil has the second highest number of total confirmed Covid cases with more than 12.6m. Only the United States has more. It is also the country with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began and its daily deaths currently account for about a quarter of all coronavirus fatalities in the entire world. The high number of cases has brought the health system to the verge of collapse. In 18 of Brazil's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia, the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is above 90%, according to Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz. In two states, AmapÃ¡ and Mato Grosso do Sul, ICU are completely full. The latest surge in cases and deaths has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus which was first detected in Japan in travellers from the city of Manaus, in Brazil's Amazon state. What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Preliminary data suggests the new variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. Neighbouring countries are extremely worried the new variant. Bolivia, which shares a 3,400km-long (2,100 miles) border with Brazil, announced that it would focus its Covid immunisation programme on the border areas. This video can not be played One epidemiologist in Brazil fears the country is ""becoming a threat to global public health"" Brazil's own vaccine programme has been beset by delays. So far, only 8% of its 211-million-strong population have received a first dose. According to a poll published by Datafolha in mid-March, 43% of Brazilians blame President Bolsonaro for the poor handling of the pandemic. Opponents of Mr Bolsonaro demand that he be impeached over his handling of the coronavirus crisis The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. While his stance made him popular with anti-lockdown protesters, his popularity is falling. In a poll conducted in mid-March, 54% of respondents said his management of the Covid crisis was ""bad"" or ""very bad"", up from 48% in January. Mr Bolsonaro was a divisive figure even before the pandemic hit and the rapid spread of Covid seems to have further hardened opinions. The Datafolha poll suggests that while the percentage of those who said they ""never trusted"" the president's words rose from 41% to 45% between January and March, those who say they ""always trust"" what has only dropped slightly from 19% to 18% in that same timeframe. However in recent days, his government has been furthered weakened by a deep political crisis. Since the pandemic began, Brazil has had no fewer than four health ministers. The latest is Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist, who replaced an army officer with no medical training on 16 March. But while changes in the health ministry have become almost par for the course, this week also saw the foreign minister and five other cabinet ministers leave. Foreign Minister Ernesto AraÃºjo had fallen foul of Congress, some of whose members accused him of mishandling relations with China, India and the US, which they said in turn led to Brazil not getting enough Covid vaccines from those countries. But it was Mr Bolsonaro's sacking of the defence minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, which caused the biggest storm so far. Mr Bolsonaro and his minister had clashed over the issue of the armed forces' loyalty, which the defence minister said should be directed to upholding the constitution rather than supporting the president personally. In a first in Brazilian history, on Tuesday the heads of the army, navy and air force all resigned together in a move signalling their opposition to the president and his sudden sacking of the defence minister's sacking. The role of the armed forces in Brazilian politics has been a contentious issue since the country's return to democracy in 1985 after 21 years of military rule. Gen Braga Netto is the new defence minister President Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused outrage in 2019 when he organised a commemoration of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. He also appointed active duty and retired generals to key positions in his cabinet, including the health ministry and the vice-presidency. But in recent weeks, top members of the military seem to have increasingly distanced themselves from the president, culminating in the resignation of the armed forces heads on Tuesday. Mr Bolsonaro's newly appointed minister of defence, Gen Walter Braga Netto, seems to be more closely aligned with the president. In one of his first statements he said that the 1964 coup had ""pacified the country"" and should be celebrated. Marking the coup's anniversary on 31 March, the general said that there had been a ""very real threat to peace and democracy"" and that the armed forces had confronted that threat in 1964.

"Germany resumed using AstraZeneca after a suspension this month Germany is suspending routine use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people aged below 60 because of a risk of rare blood clots. The German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who had received the vaccine in Germany. Canada earlier suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab in people under 55. AstraZeneca said international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed risks significantly. It said it was continuing to analyse its database to understand ""whether these very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia occur any more commonly than would be expected naturally in a population of millions of people"". ""We will continue to work with German authorities to address any questions they may have,"" it added. How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? AstraZeneca and Europe's blame game The EU and UK medicine regulators both backed the vaccine after previous cautionary suspensions in Europe this month. The European Medicines Agency,external(EMA) andthe UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,externalstressed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine continued to outweigh the risk of side effects. In the UK, a government spokesperson said: ""The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, effective and has already saved thousands of lives in this country. As the UK's independent regulator has said, when people are called forward, they should get the jab. ""Over 30 million people have already received their first dose of a vaccine, and we are on track to offer jabs to all over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July."" AstraZeneca's product is one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines in the West, and is meant to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world. The EU's rollout of its vaccination programme has been dogged by delays because of delivery and production problems, and Germany is among several states now fearing a third wave of infections. On Tuesday, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his wife, who are both 73, received their first doses of AstraZeneca in a display of confidence in the vaccine. If you give a vaccine to millions of people you will of course see some cases of people falling seriously ill or even dying shortly afterwards. It does not mean the vaccine has caused the problem - it could have occurred naturally. What authorities have to work out is whether it is cause or coincidence. They do this by monitoring adverse events after vaccination and see if they are above what you would normally expect. The type of blood clot that has been seen is very rare and so it is hard to know exactly how many cases you would normally expect to see. We do know it is more common in women and taking the pill increases the risk of it happening. There is no evidence yet to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine increases the chances of these clots. But, even if it does, the next thing you have to take into account is whether Covid presents more of a danger. Regulators in Europe and the UK are clear - given the current evidence - that use of the vaccine should continue in all ages. Health Minister Jens Spahn and the 16 state health ministers decided to suspend routine use for the under-60s at an emergency meeting on Tuesday. People under 60 can still receive the jab but only ""at the discretion of doctors, and after individual risk analysis and thorough explanation"", according to a document seen by dpa news agency. The decision was reached on the advice of the German vaccine committee (Stiko) which said: ""After several consultations, Stiko, with the help of external experts, decided by a majority to recommend the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine only for persons aged 60 years and older on the basis of available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects."" Additional advice about booster shots would be issued by the end of April for younger persons who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca, Stiko said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there must be no doubts about the safety of any drug being administered in Germany: ""We have to be able to trust the vaccines... This also includes the subsequent ongoing testing of their effectiveness and safety, and the permanent weighing of risks and benefits. Confidence arises from the knowledge that every suspicion is counted in every individual case."" Mrs Merkel said: ""I have said when it is my turn, I will get vaccinated, also with AstraZeneca"" The 66-year-old added that she was open to being vaccinated with AstraZeneca when her turn came. Ahead of  announcement, the German cities of Berlin and Munich, and the region of Brandenburg, halted use of the vaccine for people below the age of 60. Germany was one of the European states which briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab earlier this month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots. When the EMA declared the vaccine ""safe and effective"", Germany and others resumed its use but investigations continued. The German medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has found 31 cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) among people who received AstraZeneca in Germany. Almost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women. France already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55. On Monday,Canada recommended immediately suspending the use of AstraZeneca in people aged below 55,externalfollowing the reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots in Europe, CBC reports. There have been no reports of blood clots related to the jab in Canada itself, where 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca jabs have now been administered. In the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - have been recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In another development, Austria confirmed it was in talks with Russia to buy a million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine, which has yet to be approved by the EMA. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is under pressure from opposition parties for his government's failure to buy its full share of vaccines under the EU's collective purchasing scheme. ""There must be no geopolitical blinkers regarding vaccines,"" Mr Kurz said in a statement issued by his office. ""The only thing that must count is whether the vaccine is effective and safe."" Despite the lack of EMA approval, Sputnik is already being used by fellow EU state Hungary. Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed possible co-operation on vaccines with Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron when they held a video conference on Tuesday, Mr Macron's office said in astatement,external.

"A group of big names in fashion and retail are campaigning for the government to provide more support for small independent shops. They want the chancellor to offer a ""Shop Out to Help Out"" scheme to get consumers spending again when non-essential shops reopen on 12 April. It would cover 50% of a shopper's costs, up to Â£10, on Monday to Wednesdays for a month. And it would only apply at physical stores with fewer than 10 staff. The ""Save The Street"" campaign says independent retailers won't survive without it. The Treasury did not comment on whether it would pursue the idea, but said it had protected ""millions"" of retail jobs during the pandemic. The proposed scheme - which would work like the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts last year - is backed by the likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas. ""We would be kidding ourselves to think that everything will be fine for independent retailers once they reopen on 12 April,"" says Ross Bailey, the entrepreneur leading the campaign. ""Now it is the government's responsibility to support these businesses and ensure they are given a fighting chance to bounce back - the government needs to show that all businesses matter, not just big businesses."" The small shops in battle with the retail giants Retail sales stage partial recovery in February Easter egg sales 'soar by almost 50%' The British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around Â£22bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%. Independent shops - many of which lack a strong online presence - were hit particularly hard as they faced prolonged closures and restrictions. Yet this hasn't stopped people from trying to start businesses. Latest data from Cornerstone Tax, which gives advice on property stamp duty, shows 13% of consumers have started, or intend to start, their own business in 2021. The firm's research also shows more than half of consumers want to support smaller firms over retail giants. Clare Oakey is the co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, an independent fashion and homeware retailer in Colchester. Clare Oakey, co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, says keeping up payments to suppliers has hit her personal finances hard through the pandemic She and her business partner Kim will spend up to Â£1,000 on reopening promotional activities, including printing a hundred 10%-off discount vouchers for the local barber to give away, putting flower arrangements and sweets in the shop, and offering customers who make a purchase goodie bags. Ms Oakey says that five retail chain outlets on the same high street will not be reopening on 12 April, along with a number of independent stores. So even though people in Colchester generally like supporting small retailers, more needs to be done to get the public spending on the High Street again. ""We've prioritised keeping our business open by paying invoices to suppliers to keep the company running long term, but the honest truth is that it's been financially tough on a very personal level for me and my business partner,"" Clare tells the BBC. ""We really badly need the support - any form of help to let us catch up and break even, in terms of a scheme that incentivises the customers. We're nothing without customers."" The only nice thing, she says, is that local independent businesses have come together to help each other out. For example, while the Frippery has been closed in the most recent lockdown, a nearby artisan coffee shop, Sir Isaacs Coffee House, has offered a click-and-collect service on its behalf. It meant the Frippery could continue serving its customers online, while the coffee shop got more exposure and hopefully sold a few extra coffees. Retail analysts are also seriously concerned about the situation facing Britain's independent shops. ""Independent retailers have had a tumultuous year and immediate action is needed to avoid a high street apocalypse,"" says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail. A Shop Out to Help Out Scheme would encourage consumers to ""ditch their screens"" and support their local shops, she says. ""This is a unique opportunity to redefine our high streets, but without government support we'll be bracing for a retail bloodbath."" Retail expert Kate Hardcastle says this time the government needs to do more than just say âBuy localâ. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle agrees, pointing out that independent retailers were the ones who ""really demonstrated their worth"" in the early days of the pandemic in coming to their communities' aid when other retailers didn't have their online shopping offerings ready. She is concerned that everyone will forget about them now. ""Just telling people to shop small as has been previous campaigns might serve as a reminder, not an action,"" she tells the BBC. ""Just as the case was with Eat Out to Help Out, we need to see our government support small businesses longer term. ""I'd love to see initiatives to make it easier for small businesses to open up on the High Street and rejuvenate."" She says the collaborative approach used by the Frippery and its neighbours is the right one: ""The future of small businesses has to be one of collaboration and not feeling they have to justify their worth to consumers all the time, but being able to focus on a brilliant offer because they can afford to survive."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""We've supported retailers across the UK though out the outbreak, protecting millions of jobs - and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ""Shops won't pay any business rates until July, can continue to furlough staff until September, and are receiving Restart Grants of up to Â£6,000.""

"David Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016 Labour says it has obtained an old business card that described financier Lex Greensill as a ""senior adviser"" in David Cameron's office. The card includes a Downing Street email address, and what appears to be a direct line landline telephone number. The party said it raised ""further serious questions"" about Mr Greensill's influence under the ex-PM. The government has said Mr Greensill's role was unpaid and ""approved in the normal manner"". The Sunday Times has reported that he was given ""privileged access"" to Whitehall when he worked as an unpaid adviser under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter. Labour calls for watchdog to probe Greensill role Minister defends Cameron as 'a man of integrity' Liberty Steel nationalisation 'an option' Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC News Channel that unpaid advisers offered Whitehall departments ""fantastic expertise and experience, completely free of charge"". He added that, if Mr Greensill had had a government business card showing an official email account, these would have been ""signed off by civil servants at the time"". Labour says the business card was handed to a figure in industry in the summer of 2012 by Mr Greensill, after he started the advisory role on business financing. The Sunday Times reported that during his time in the role, he had promoted a government-backed loans scheme to speed up payments to pharmacists. The company he founded, Greensill Capital, later went on to provide funds for the scheme. In 2018 - two years after he had stood down as prime minister - Mr Cameron became an adviser to the firm. Labour has called for an urgent inquiry in to the matter and it wants the Committee on Standards In Public Life to look into the extent of the access to government offered to Mr Greensill under the coalition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""The public have a right to know what happened here . We need a full, transparent and thorough investigation"". The committee has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency. Labour has also asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of Greensill Capital after the firm employed him as an adviser. The Financial Times has previously reported that Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to Covid-hit companies. Greensill wasaccredited to supply lending,externalunder the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, before it filed for insolvency earlier this month. Last week, Mr Cameron wascleared by a lobbying watchdog, after it concluded his work for the company did not require declaration on the register of consultant lobbyists. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Lex Greensill acted as a Supply Chain Finance Adviser from 2012 to 2015 and as a Crown Representative for three years from 2013. ""His appointment was approved in the normal manner and he was not paid for either role.""

"The leaders of Scotland's five larger political parties have taken part their first head-to-head TV debate of this election campaign Those taking part are Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Lorna Slater (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold an independence referendum in the first half of the new Holyrood parliament But Conservative Mr Ross believes a focus on independence is taking away from education and the pandemic recovery Labour's Mr Sarwar insists Scotland needs an NHS restart plan with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services Ms Slater of the Scottish Greens backs a referendum happening within the next Scottish Parliament term Lib Dem Mr Rennie says the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways and the next Holyrood government needs to make sure primary care has proper investment BBC Scotland News Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Lorna Slater, for the Scottish Greens, claimed to have ""won"" the
4% pay increase offered by the Scottish government to NHS workers (other than
doctors), as part of the deal between the SNP and Greens on the 2020-21 budget. This is not fully supported in published letters. When the deal was
struck earlier this month, Kate Forbes, the SNP's finance secretary, wrote to
the Greens saying she would prioritise pay for public sector workers when
allocating additional funds that had just been released by the Treasury. The
reply from the Greens recognised the SNP had already gone further on public
sector pay than the Treasury, and said its understanding with Ms Forbes was
that it would go further still. But there was no figure put on that,
recognising also that is a matter for pay negotiations. It also said the pay offer
should go to public sector workers more widely, dependent on Scottish
government funding, but the deal offered last week only covered the NHS. It was
one of the less clear-cut budget achievements by the Greens. In these negotiations,
the smaller party is usually pushing the governing party to go further in a
direction it would wish to go anyway. The commitment to increased pay was an agreement
with the SNP rather than a compromise. Prof John Curtice told the BBC News channel that Brexit was not mentioned during the debate but it had changed the character of support for the parties in Scotland in the past five years. He said the Conservatives did not not do very well among Remain voters. However, the SNP is much more popular among Remain voters than Leave supporters, while support for independence is higher among Remain voters than Leavers, Prof Curtice says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor We got a foretaste tonight of the
six-week campaign to come and a big reminder of the fault line in Scottish politics - the constitutional question of whether Scotland should be an independent country and whether it should have a referendum in the next parliament. The first minister confirmed she would like to have
that in the first half of the parliament if the pandemic crisis has passed. What the
definition of that is we donât know though. The Scottish Greens are also happy to have it at some
point but are not boxing themselves in on timing. The other parties are opposed, with Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservatives' leader, working hard to be the most oppositional of the opposition leaders. He said he didnât
want to work with a party like the SNP because it supports independence. For that, the
Scottish Labour leader Anar Sarwar told Mr Ross to ""grow up"", because Mr Sarwar supports a more co-operational politics despite the
constitutional divide. I think Nicola Sturgeon, perhaps unsurprisingly, looks a bit tired â she is the leader of the Scottish government, was on government business
today and has been leading the efforts to tackle the pandemic over the last year. She can still command
the details across the range of different
policies and she demonstrated that tonight. As the incumbent leader, she is
attacked from all sides and that takes some endurance over the course of an hour
or so. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a noisy exchange, Douglas Ross accused the SNP of failing
to fulfil its promise to reform council tax, while Nicola Sturgeon protested
(though parts of it were not audible)that it had been frozen while the SNP has
been in office and is lower in Scotland. Both were right. In 2007, the
incoming SNP administration said the ""hated council tax"" would go and be
replaced with a local income tax. As a minority administration, it failed to
get sufficient support for that. When it got a majority in 2011, it had gone
cold on the idea. Instead, it froze council tax for nine years, then allowed councils to raise it, and then froze it last year and for 2021-22. The SNP
leader was arguing that council tax is lower in Scotland. At Band D, the
average Scottish bill in 2020-21 is Â£1,308, in Wales it is Â£1,667 and in England
it is Â£1,818. Polling expert Prof John Curtice tells the BBC News channel that politics is about presenting a ""big narrative"". He says he is not sure any of the party leaders painted a clear picture of the kind of country they wanted to create. Prof Curtice says Boris Johnson won the 2019 general election by constantly reiterating ""Get Brexit Done"". There was nothing similar here, he says, and there is a danger their policies will ""wash over the people of Scotland"". Studio guests John Curtice, Lesley Riddoch and Pamela Nash Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, told the BBC News channel that the vast majority of people think Covid recovery should be the priority in this election - not another independence referendum. Broadcaster and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says the debate did not feel very balanced because it had three questions at the start suggesting it is impossible to move forward with an independence plan while we are in a pandemic. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said he thought that the leaders on the panel kept coming back to the issue of whether Scotland should be contemplating a referendum no matter what the question was actually about. ""Tonight, it emphasises the way the constitutional question is going to dominate this campaign despite what people like Pamela argue,"" Prof Curtice says. He says Tory leader Douglas Ross, who is against an independence referendum, was just as eager to talk about it as Nicola Sturgeon.  Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was challenged by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross on why all schoolchildren had been offered free devices at the start of the election campaign (a key SNP pledge this week) rather than at the start of the pandemic when they needed them. Ms Sturgeon responded that at the start of the pandemic they had been concentrating on those most in need and had discovered that there were 70,000 young people who needed devices but didnât have them. She said âso far just short of 70,000 devicesâ¦ rightly and properly those devices have been delivered to people in needâ. Arelease from the Scottish government,externalsaid that at the end of January 63,382 devices and 11,846 connectivity packages had been distributed to learners across Scotland and âit is expected that over 70,000 individuals will benefit in totalâ. Anas Sarwarsays from his own experience as an ethnic minority
politician, everyone has a duty to condemn perpetrators of abuse and show solidarity with the
victims. That is a ""cast-iron commitment from me"", he says. Willie Renniesays it is depressing that we
get to such a state in politics that we have to resort to abuse to get points
across. Politicians should work together and stand together every single time, he says, and ""I can guarantee I will act in the
right way"". Douglas Rosssays he was doing an interview today when one person walked past saying they wanted to shoot him, and another wanted a socially-distant selfie. That is the nature
of Scottish politics â ""we are so divided"", he says - but adds that everyone can agree they would take
urgent action if abuse was highlighted. Lorna Slatersays we need a parliament which ""really reflects the people of Scotland"", with a proper gender balance and more women, ethnic minorities and trans people. We have âtoo many old, wealthy, white men making
decisions"" , she says, and highlights the Scottish Greens' candidate list is 70%
women. Nicola Sturgeonsays she will call out abuse ""whenever it
needs to be called out"". Politicians must recognise their responsibilities and not just call it out when it involves another party, she says. None of us are perfect on
this, she adds, but says the leaders must ""rise to the occasion"" and focus on what they can agree on rather than the ""legitimate differences"" between
us. Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the Scottish governmentâs measures to reduce emissions. She said: â97% of our electricity already comes from renewable sources so we should take that as motivation to go further.â It is true that in 2020, the equivalent of 97.4% of Scotland's electricity demand came from renewables.
 
Thatâs an impressive increase from the figure of 24% in 2010. But it should be mentioned that the Scottish governmentâs target, set in 2011, was to achieve 100% from renewable sources last year. That target was narrowly missed. Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland environment correspondent In an age of polarised politics, tackling the self-declared climate crisis has been a rare point of unity for MSPs in the parliamentary term which has just ended.  The only debate was how quickly we do it. Scottish Labour wanted it faster than the SNP; the Scottish Greens even speedier.  But that doesnât set anyone apart in an election campaign. In the leaders debate, though, there was a moment of polarisation between the Tories and the Greens. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross lauded the Â£16bn North Sea transition deal designed to secure a future for oil and gas workers.  âMore money for oil and gas?â questioned an indignant Scottish Greensâ co-leader Lorna Slater. In reality, the transition deal is a lot more nuanced than that and the politicians know it. The Lib Dems spoke of the importance of a so called ""just transition"" where communities are not harmed by decarbonisation. That canât be achieved if the North Sea sector is shut down tomorrow. Scottish Greens co-leaderLorna Slatersays the climate crisis has to be the number one concern and only her party has the solutions. She says we should not just dabble in climate measures - instead we have to ""do everything all at once now"". Ms Slater calls for moves to drive carbon emissions down as quickly as we can. She says she wants to invest in renewable energy and in Scotland's homes and public transport. Douglas Rossof the Scottish Tories says he hopes the Scottish government will work with the UK government on the North Sea transition deal which will see tens of thousands of jobs protected as they move from oil and gas into more renewable energy. Mr Ross cannot say when he thinks North Sea oil and gas production will cease but says the UK is working with the industry. Scottish Labour'sAnas Sarwarsays the world will be watching Glasgow in November when the COP26 climate change conference comes to Glasgow. He says we have got to make sure it shows the best of Glasgow and the best of Scotland. SNP leaderNicola Sturgeonsays Scotland already leads the world in carbon emission reductions, with some of the most stretching targets anywhere. She says we have to match what we have done in electricity generation with action in other areas such as how we heat our homes. MS Sturgeon says the SNP manifesto will have proposals on that. Scottish Lib Dem leaderWillie Renniesays we need the same national purpose on climate change as we have had on Covid. The pandemic has shown we don't need to use our cars as much, we can do much more remotely, he says. Mr Rennie says it is a travesty that we are about to build a huge wind farm offshore off Fife and Scotland did not get any of the work to build them. Chris ClementsSocial Affairs Correspondent, The Nine After a downward trend since the 1990s, child poverty in Scotland has been on the rise for the past few years. Figures released last week revealed that, before Covid, a quarter of all children in Scotland - around 240,000 - were living below the breadline. Two thirds of them come from families who are in work.
The pandemic has likely made that problem worse. In the last year, the number of people claiming Universal Credit in Scotland doubled - suggesting many families are struggling. Nicola Sturgeon said a rise in poverty is due to an âassaultâ on welfare by Westminster. She wants to double her partyâs flagship top-up Child Payment - raising it to Â£20 a week for each child under six in families claiming benefits. However, that payment was only introduced last month. It also still needs to be rolled out for older children by the end of 2022. Other parties such as the Lib Dems say the benefit should have been introduced much earlier during the SNPâs tenure. Child poverty rates remain lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK. But Scotland has set itself tough targets - by 2030, only 10 per cent of children should be in relative poverty. At the moment, the numbers are going in the wrong direction. Willie Renniesays yes, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats argued for it during the pandemic. Scottish Conservatives leaderDouglas Rossis not convinced
of the argument for it. Lorna Slatersays the Scottish Greens are committed
to working towards it and will support trials of it in the next parliament. Anas Sarwarsays yes, Scottish Labour
supports it and the pandemic was a missed opportunity to trial it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the
pandemic has made her more supportive of it, but the reality of not having full
control over tax and social security is that it cannot be done fully in Scotland. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Willie Rennie says the process of independence for Scotland
would be âjust like Brexitâ. Would it? That depends on how it is handled. The problems with negotiating Brexit were largely tied up with the British
government wishing to remove itself from the single market and customs union.
It is not clear that Scotland would wish to remove itself from the single
market and customs union with the rest of the UK. If the leadership at Holyrood
wishes instead to re-join the European single market, it may have to make a
significant break from the UKâs market regulation and rules. Another feature of
the Brexit negotiations was that the European Commission fought hard to protect
its members' interests, and to send a signal that leaving the EU would come at a
cost for others who might choose to do so. That would be less of a concern for
Downing Street in negotiating on Scottish independence. But having lost the
battle to persuade Scots to stay in the Union, leaders at Westminster could
negotiate hard in the interests of the rest of the UK. And as the European
Commission did, they could press home the negotiating advantages as the larger,
more powerful partner in a split. Such ""what if?"" arguments become highly
hypothetical. As Glasgow prepares to host the COP26 climate conference, what will you do to ensure Scotland's contribution to reducing the global rate of warming to pre-industrial levels?""  Reality Check In the debate Willie Rennie said: âWeâve got 1500 young people who are waiting for mental health support for over a yearâ The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader is right with this claim.
 
The most recent official waiting times statistics for Scotlandâs child and adolescent mental health services (known as Camhs) showed that in December there were 1,560 patients who had waited more than 52 weeks. This equates to about 14% of patients,according to Public Health Scotland,external. Anas Sarwarsays Scotland needs an NHS restart plan
with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services, so they
are accessible in GP practices and workplaces. The Scottish Labour leader welcomes
the proposed 4% pay rise for NHS staff, and says social care staff should also get a pay
rise. Douglas Rosssays although we are getting close to
10,000 lives being lost in Scotland, a figure âwhich shames us allâ, it would have
been higher if not for the incredible efforts of NHS staff. The governmentâs
treatment time guarantee has never been met while Nicola Sturgeon has been
first minister, he adds. Nicola Sturgeonsays the government
has invested three times as much as they committed to in the NHS. The first
minister has been working on plans for temporary operating facilities and
mobile units to bring down the backlog, with six permanent elective centres âin
trainâ, and three will be operational by the end of May, she adds. Willie Renniesays the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways
and we need to make sure primary care has proper investment and mental health
services are up to scratch so they are not putting pressure on the service. Professionals, not politicians, should be in charge of setting targets for dealing with the backlog of operations, he adds. Lorna Slatersays every party is committed to an investment-led
recovery, but the question is what are we investing in? Boris Johnson can find
the money to buy nuclear weapons, but not to give nurses a pay rise, she says.
Ms Slater is happy to hear there is consensus on a national care service, which
will reduce pressure on the NHS. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to use the next five years to
try to get back into the EU single market.  'Trying' to do so is a
significant qualification. That would require Scotland to leave the UK, then to
have autonomy to negotiate a new relationship with the European Union - either
as a full member state or perhaps, like Norway, as part of the European
Economic Area. It's not clear what would be required, as no country has done
this before: currently having full alignment with EU market rules, which should
make convergence simple and then negotiating re-engagement. It is not clear
what terms the EU would place on that. And one criticism of the plan is that it
would put the frontier of the European single market on the border between
Scotland and England, which is a more important market for Scottish business
than all overseas countries put together. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Itâs a big question, how does the NHS get back on track after the pandemic? Psychiatrists are warning of a huge mental health crisis in a service already struggling to cope with demand.

There are concerns about the impact on cancer services. All but urgent surgery was postponed in the first wave and there are waits to get key diagnostic tests. Doctors worry about those who have symptoms but have put off coming forward.

For more routine treatments, doctors are being asked to prioritise those most in need, but that inevitably means others will experience long, long waits. By far the biggest share of the Scottish budget is already being spent on health and Covid will continue to put pressure on the health service in the months to come. So itâs a very difficult question for all parties, how to get more out of the NHS? Â© 2025 BBC.

"David Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016 Labour says it has obtained an old business card that described financier Lex Greensill as a ""senior adviser"" in David Cameron's office. The card includes a Downing Street email address, and what appears to be a direct line landline telephone number. The party said it raised ""further serious questions"" about Mr Greensill's influence under the ex-PM. The government has said Mr Greensill's role was unpaid and ""approved in the normal manner"". The Sunday Times has reported that he was given ""privileged access"" to Whitehall when he worked as an unpaid adviser under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter. Labour calls for watchdog to probe Greensill role Minister defends Cameron as 'a man of integrity' Liberty Steel nationalisation 'an option' Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC News Channel that unpaid advisers offered Whitehall departments ""fantastic expertise and experience, completely free of charge"". He added that, if Mr Greensill had had a government business card showing an official email account, these would have been ""signed off by civil servants at the time"". Labour says the business card was handed to a figure in industry in the summer of 2012 by Mr Greensill, after he started the advisory role on business financing. The Sunday Times reported that during his time in the role, he had promoted a government-backed loans scheme to speed up payments to pharmacists. The company he founded, Greensill Capital, later went on to provide funds for the scheme. In 2018 - two years after he had stood down as prime minister - Mr Cameron became an adviser to the firm. Labour has called for an urgent inquiry in to the matter and it wants the Committee on Standards In Public Life to look into the extent of the access to government offered to Mr Greensill under the coalition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""The public have a right to know what happened here . We need a full, transparent and thorough investigation"". The committee has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency. Labour has also asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of Greensill Capital after the firm employed him as an adviser. The Financial Times has previously reported that Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to Covid-hit companies. Greensill wasaccredited to supply lending,externalunder the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, before it filed for insolvency earlier this month. Last week, Mr Cameron wascleared by a lobbying watchdog, after it concluded his work for the company did not require declaration on the register of consultant lobbyists. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Lex Greensill acted as a Supply Chain Finance Adviser from 2012 to 2015 and as a Crown Representative for three years from 2013.

"The leaders of Scotland's five larger political parties have taken part their first head-to-head TV debate of this election campaign Those taking part are Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Lorna Slater (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold an independence referendum in the first half of the new Holyrood parliament But Conservative Mr Ross believes a focus on independence is taking away from education and the pandemic recovery Labour's Mr Sarwar insists Scotland needs an NHS restart plan with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services Ms Slater of the Scottish Greens backs a referendum happening within the next Scottish Parliament term Lib Dem Mr Rennie says the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways and the next Holyrood government needs to make sure primary care has proper investment BBC Scotland News Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Lorna Slater, for the Scottish Greens, claimed to have ""won"" the
4% pay increase offered by the Scottish government to NHS workers (other than
doctors), as part of the deal between the SNP and Greens on the 2020-21 budget. This is not fully supported in published letters. When the deal was
struck earlier this month, Kate Forbes, the SNP's finance secretary, wrote to
the Greens saying she would prioritise pay for public sector workers when
allocating additional funds that had just been released by the Treasury. The
reply from the Greens recognised the SNP had already gone further on public
sector pay than the Treasury, and said its understanding with Ms Forbes was
that it would go further still. But there was no figure put on that,
recognising also that is a matter for pay negotiations. It also said the pay offer
should go to public sector workers more widely, dependent on Scottish
government funding, but the deal offered last week only covered the NHS. It was
one of the less clear-cut budget achievements by the Greens. In these negotiations,
the smaller party is usually pushing the governing party to go further in a
direction it would wish to go anyway. The commitment to increased pay was an agreement
with the SNP rather than a compromise. Prof John Curtice told the BBC News channel that Brexit was not mentioned during the debate but it had changed the character of support for the parties in Scotland in the past five years. He said the Conservatives did not not do very well among Remain voters. However, the SNP is much more popular among Remain voters than Leave supporters, while support for independence is higher among Remain voters than Leavers, Prof Curtice says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor We got a foretaste tonight of the
six-week campaign to come and a big reminder of the fault line in Scottish politics - the constitutional question of whether Scotland should be an independent country and whether it should have a referendum in the next parliament. The first minister confirmed she would like to have
that in the first half of the parliament if the pandemic crisis has passed. What the
definition of that is we donât know though. The Scottish Greens are also happy to have it at some

more powerful partner in a split. Such ""what if?"" arguments become highly
hypothetical. As Glasgow prepares to host the COP26 climate conference, what will you do to ensure Scotland's contribution to reducing the global rate of warming to pre-industrial levels?""  Reality Check In the debate Willie Rennie said: âWeâve got 1500 young people who are waiting for mental health support for over a yearâ The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader is right with this claim.
 
The most recent official waiting times statistics for Scotlandâs child and adolescent mental health services (known as Camhs) showed that in December there were 1,560 patients who had waited more than 52 weeks. This equates to about 14% of patients,according to Public Health Scotland,external. Anas Sarwarsays Scotland needs an NHS restart plan
with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services, so they
are accessible in GP practices and workplaces. The Scottish Labour leader welcomes
the proposed 4% pay rise for NHS staff, and says social care staff should also get a pay
rise. Douglas Rosssays although we are getting close to
10,000 lives being lost in Scotland, a figure âwhich shames us allâ, it would have
been higher if not for the incredible efforts of NHS staff. The governmentâs
treatment time guarantee has never been met while Nicola Sturgeon has been
first minister, he adds. Nicola Sturgeonsays the government
has invested three times as much as they committed to in the NHS. The first
minister has been working on plans for temporary operating facilities and
mobile units to bring down the backlog, with six permanent elective centres âin
trainâ, and three will be operational by the end of May, she adds. Willie Renniesays the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways
and we need to make sure primary care has proper investment and mental health
services are up to scratch so they are not putting pressure on the service. Professionals, not politicians, should be in charge of setting targets for dealing with the backlog of operations, he adds. Lorna Slatersays every party is committed to an investment-led
recovery, but the question is what are we investing in? Boris Johnson can find
the money to buy nuclear weapons, but not to give nurses a pay rise, she says.
Ms Slater is happy to hear there is consensus on a national care service, which
will reduce pressure on the NHS. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to use the next five years to
try to get back into the EU single market.  'Trying' to do so is a
significant qualification. That would require Scotland to leave the UK, then to
have autonomy to negotiate a new relationship with the European Union - either
as a full member state or perhaps, like Norway, as part of the European
Economic Area. It's not clear what would be required, as no country has done
this before: currently having full alignment with EU market rules, which should
make convergence simple and then negotiating re-engagement. It is not clear
what terms the EU would place on that. And one criticism of the plan is that it
would put the frontier of the European single market on the border between
Scotland and England, which is a more important market for Scottish business
than all overseas countries put together. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Itâs a big question, how does the NHS get back on track after the pandemic? Psychiatrists are warning of a huge mental health crisis in a service already struggling to cope with demand.

There are concerns about the impact on cancer services. All but urgent surgery was postponed in the first wave and there are waits to get key diagnostic tests. Doctors worry about those who have symptoms but have put off coming forward.

For more routine treatments, doctors are being asked to prioritise those most in need, but that inevitably means others will experience long, long waits. By far the biggest share of the Scottish budget is already being spent on health and Covid will continue to put pressure on the health service in the months to come. So itâs a very difficult question for all parties, how to get more out of the NHS? Â© 2025 BBC.

"The leaders of Scotland's five larger political parties have taken part their first head-to-head TV debate of this election campaign Those taking part are Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Lorna Slater (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold an independence referendum in the first half of the new Holyrood parliament But Conservative Mr Ross believes a focus on independence is taking away from education and the pandemic recovery Labour's Mr Sarwar insists Scotland needs an NHS restart plan with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services Ms Slater of the Scottish Greens backs a referendum happening within the next Scottish Parliament term Lib Dem Mr Rennie says the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways and the next Holyrood government needs to make sure primary care has proper investment BBC Scotland News Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Lorna Slater, for the Scottish Greens, claimed to have ""won"" the
4% pay increase offered by the Scottish government to NHS workers (other than
doctors), as part of the deal between the SNP and Greens on the 2020-21 budget. This is not fully supported in published letters. When the deal was
struck earlier this month, Kate Forbes, the SNP's finance secretary, wrote to
the Greens saying she would prioritise pay for public sector workers when
allocating additional funds that had just been released by the Treasury. The
reply from the Greens recognised the SNP had already gone further on public
sector pay than the Treasury, and said its understanding with Ms Forbes was
that it would go further still. But there was no figure put on that,
recognising also that is a matter for pay negotiations. It also said the pay offer
should go to public sector workers more widely, dependent on Scottish
government funding, but the deal offered last week only covered the NHS. It was
one of the less clear-cut budget achievements by the Greens. In these negotiations,
the smaller party is usually pushing the governing party to go further in a
direction it would wish to go anyway. The commitment to increased pay was an agreement
with the SNP rather than a compromise. Prof John Curtice told the BBC News channel that Brexit was not mentioned during the debate but it had changed the character of support for the parties in Scotland in the past five years. He said the Conservatives did not not do very well among Remain voters. However, the SNP is much more popular among Remain voters than Leave supporters, while support for independence is higher among Remain voters than Leavers, Prof Curtice says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor We got a foretaste tonight of the
six-week campaign to come and a big reminder of the fault line in Scottish politics - the constitutional question of whether Scotland should be an independent country and whether it should have a referendum in the next parliament. The first minister confirmed she would like to have
that in the first half of the parliament if the pandemic crisis has passed. What the
definition of that is we donât know though. The Scottish Greens are also happy to have it at some
point but are not boxing themselves in on timing. The other parties are opposed, with Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservatives' leader, working hard to be the most oppositional of the opposition leaders. He said he didnât
want to work with a party like the SNP because it supports independence. For that, the
Scottish Labour leader Anar Sarwar told Mr Ross to ""grow up"", because Mr Sarwar supports a more co-operational politics despite the
constitutional divide. I think Nicola Sturgeon, perhaps unsurprisingly, looks a bit tired â she is the leader of the Scottish government, was on government business
today and has been leading the efforts to tackle the pandemic over the last year. She can still command
the details across the range of different
policies and she demonstrated that tonight. As the incumbent leader, she is
attacked from all sides and that takes some endurance over the course of an hour
or so. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a noisy exchange, Douglas Ross accused the SNP of failing
to fulfil its promise to reform council tax, while Nicola Sturgeon protested
(though parts of it were not audible)that it had been frozen while the SNP has
been in office and is lower in Scotland. Both were right. In 2007, the
incoming SNP administration said the ""hated council tax"" would go and be
replaced with a local income tax. As a minority administration, it failed to
get sufficient support for that. When it got a majority in 2011, it had gone
cold on the idea. Instead, it froze council tax for nine years, then allowed councils to raise it, and then froze it last year and for 2021-22. The SNP
leader was arguing that council tax is lower in Scotland. At Band D, the
average Scottish bill in 2020-21 is Â£1,308, in Wales it is Â£1,667 and in England
it is Â£1,818. Polling expert Prof John Curtice tells the BBC News channel that politics is about presenting a ""big narrative"". He says he is not sure any of the party leaders painted a clear picture of the kind of country they wanted to create. Prof Curtice says Boris Johnson won the 2019 general election by constantly reiterating ""Get Brexit Done"". There was nothing similar here, he says, and there is a danger their policies will ""wash over the people of Scotland"". Studio guests John Curtice, Lesley Riddoch and Pamela Nash Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, told the BBC News channel that the vast majority of people think Covid recovery should be the priority in this election - not another independence referendum. Broadcaster and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says the debate did not feel very balanced because it had three questions at the start suggesting it is impossible to move forward with an independence plan while we are in a pandemic. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said he thought that the leaders on the panel kept coming back to the issue of whether Scotland should be contemplating a referendum no matter what the question was actually about. ""Tonight, it emphasises the way the constitutional question is going to dominate this campaign despite what people like Pamela argue,"" Prof Curtice says. He says Tory leader Douglas Ross, who is against an independence referendum, was just as eager to talk about it as Nicola Sturgeon.  Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was challenged by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross on why all schoolchildren had been offered free devices at the start of the election campaign (a key SNP pledge this week) rather than at the start of the pandemic when they needed them. Ms Sturgeon responded that at the start of the pandemic they had been concentrating on those most in need and had discovered that there were 70,000 young people who needed devices but didnât have them. She said âso far just short of 70,000 devicesâ¦ rightly and properly those devices have been delivered to people in needâ. Arelease from the Scottish government,externalsaid that at the end of January 63,382 devices and 11,846 connectivity packages had been distributed to learners across Scotland and âit is expected that over 70,000 individuals will benefit in totalâ. Anas Sarwarsays from his own experience as an ethnic minority
politician, everyone has a duty to condemn perpetrators of abuse and show solidarity with the
victims. That is a ""cast-iron commitment from me"", he says. Willie Renniesays it is depressing that we
get to such a state in politics that we have to resort to abuse to get points
across. Politicians should work together and stand together every single time, he says, and ""I can guarantee I will act in the
right way"". Douglas Rosssays he was doing an interview today when one person walked past saying they wanted to shoot him, and another wanted a socially-distant selfie. That is the nature
of Scottish politics â ""we are so divided"", he says - but adds that everyone can agree they would take
urgent action if abuse was highlighted. Lorna Slatersays we need a parliament which ""really reflects the people of Scotland"", with a proper gender balance and more women, ethnic minorities and trans people. We have âtoo many old, wealthy, white men making
decisions"" , she says, and highlights the Scottish Greens' candidate list is 70%
women. Nicola Sturgeonsays she will call out abuse ""whenever it
needs to be called out"". Politicians must recognise their responsibilities and not just call it out when it involves another party, she says. None of us are perfect on
this, she adds, but says the leaders must ""rise to the occasion"" and focus on what they can agree on rather than the ""legitimate differences"" between
us. Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the Scottish governmentâs measures to reduce emissions. She said: â97% of our electricity already comes from renewable sources so we should take that as motivation to go further.â It is true that in 2020, the equivalent of 97.4% of Scotland's electricity demand came from renewables.
 
Thatâs an impressive increase from the figure of 24% in 2010. But it should be mentioned that the Scottish governmentâs target, set in 2011, was to achieve 100% from renewable sources last year. That target was narrowly missed. Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland environment correspondent In an age of polarised politics, tackling the self-declared climate crisis has been a rare point of unity for MSPs in the parliamentary term which has just ended.  The only debate was how quickly we do it. Scottish Labour wanted it faster than the SNP; the Scottish Greens even speedier.  But that doesnât set anyone apart in an election campaign. In the leaders debate, though, there was a moment of polarisation between the Tories and the Greens. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross lauded the Â£16bn North Sea transition deal designed to secure a future for oil and gas workers.  âMore money for oil and gas?â questioned an indignant Scottish Greensâ co-leader Lorna Slater. In reality, the transition deal is a lot more nuanced than that and the politicians know it. The Lib Dems spoke of the importance of a so called ""just transition"" where communities are not harmed by decarbonisation. That canât be achieved if the North Sea sector is shut down tomorrow. Scottish Greens co-leaderLorna Slatersays the climate crisis has to be the number one concern and only her party has the solutions. She says we should not just dabble in climate measures - instead we have to ""do everything all at once now"". Ms Slater calls for moves to drive carbon emissions down as quickly as we can. She says she wants to invest in renewable energy and in Scotland's homes and public transport. Douglas Rossof the Scottish Tories says he hopes the Scottish government will work with the UK government on the North Sea transition deal which will see tens of thousands of jobs protected as they move from oil and gas into more renewable energy. Mr Ross cannot say when he thinks North Sea oil and gas production will cease but says the UK is working with the industry. Scottish Labour'sAnas Sarwarsays the world will be watching Glasgow in November when the COP26 climate change conference comes to Glasgow. He says we have got to make sure it shows the best of Glasgow and the best of Scotland. SNP leaderNicola Sturgeonsays Scotland already leads the world in carbon emission reductions, with some of the most stretching targets anywhere. She says we have to match what we have done in electricity generation with action in other areas such as how we heat our homes. MS Sturgeon says the SNP manifesto will have proposals on that. Scottish Lib Dem leaderWillie Renniesays we need the same national purpose on climate change as we have had on Covid. The pandemic has shown we don't need to use our cars as much, we can do much more remotely, he says. Mr Rennie says it is a travesty that we are about to build a huge wind farm offshore off Fife and Scotland did not get any of the work to build them. Chris ClementsSocial Affairs Correspondent, The Nine After a downward trend since the 1990s, child poverty in Scotland has been on the rise for the past few years. Figures released last week revealed that, before Covid, a quarter of all children in Scotland - around 240,000 - were living below the breadline. Two thirds of them come from families who are in work.
The pandemic has likely made that problem worse. In the last year, the number of people claiming Universal Credit in Scotland doubled - suggesting many families are struggling. Nicola Sturgeon said a rise in poverty is due to an âassaultâ on welfare by Westminster. She wants to double her partyâs flagship top-up Child Payment - raising it to Â£20 a week for each child under six in families claiming benefits. However, that payment was only introduced last month. It also still needs to be rolled out for older children by the end of 2022. Other parties such as the Lib Dems say the benefit should have been introduced much earlier during the SNPâs tenure. Child poverty rates remain lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK. But Scotland has set itself tough targets - by 2030, only 10 per cent of children should be in relative poverty. At the moment, the numbers are going in the wrong direction. Willie Renniesays yes, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats argued for it during the pandemic. Scottish Conservatives leaderDouglas Rossis not convinced
of the argument for it. Lorna Slatersays the Scottish Greens are committed
to working towards it and will support trials of it in the next parliament. Anas Sarwarsays yes, Scottish Labour
supports it and the pandemic was a missed opportunity to trial it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the
pandemic has made her more supportive of it, but the reality of not having full
control over tax and social security is that it cannot be done fully in Scotland. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Willie Rennie says the process of independence for Scotland
would be âjust like Brexitâ. Would it? That depends on how it is handled. The problems with negotiating Brexit were largely tied up with the British
government wishing to remove itself from the single market and customs union.
It is not clear that Scotland would wish to remove itself from the single
market and customs union with the rest of the UK. If the leadership at Holyrood
wishes instead to re-join the European single market, it may have to make a
significant break from the UKâs market regulation and rules. Another feature of
the Brexit negotiations was that the European Commission fought hard to protect
its members' interests, and to send a signal that leaving the EU would come at a
cost for others who might choose to do so. That would be less of a concern for
Downing Street in negotiating on Scottish independence. But having lost the
battle to persuade Scots to stay in the Union, leaders at Westminster could
negotiate hard in the interests of the rest of the UK. And as the European
Commission did, they could press home the negotiating advantages as the larger,
more powerful partner in a split. Such ""what if?"" arguments become highly
hypothetical. As Glasgow prepares to host the COP26 climate conference, what will you do to ensure Scotland's contribution to reducing the global rate of warming to pre-industrial levels?""

"Germany resumed using AstraZeneca after a suspension this month Germany is suspending routine use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people aged below 60 because of a risk of rare blood clots. The German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who had received the vaccine in Germany. Canada earlier suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab in people under 55. AstraZeneca said international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed risks significantly. It said it was continuing to analyse its database to understand ""whether these very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia occur any more commonly than would be expected naturally in a population of millions of people"". ""We will continue to work with German authorities to address any questions they may have,"" it added. How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? AstraZeneca and Europe's blame game The EU and UK medicine regulators both backed the vaccine after previous cautionary suspensions in Europe this month. The European Medicines Agency,external(EMA) andthe UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,externalstressed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine continued to outweigh the risk of side effects. In the UK, a government spokesperson said: ""The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, effective and has already saved thousands of lives in this country. As the UK's independent regulator has said, when people are called forward, they should get the jab. ""Over 30 million people have already received their first dose of a vaccine, and we are on track to offer jabs to all over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July."" AstraZeneca's product is one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines in the West, and is meant to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world. The EU's rollout of its vaccination programme has been dogged by delays because of delivery and production problems, and Germany is among several states now fearing a third wave of infections. On Tuesday, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his wife, who are both 73, received their first doses of AstraZeneca in a display of confidence in the vaccine. If you give a vaccine to millions of people you will of course see some cases of people falling seriously ill or even dying shortly afterwards. It does not mean the vaccine has caused the problem - it could have occurred naturally. What authorities have to work out is whether it is cause or coincidence. They do this by monitoring adverse events after vaccination and see if they are above what you would normally expect. The type of blood clot that has been seen is very rare and so it is hard to know exactly how many cases you would normally expect to see. We do know it is more common in women and taking the pill increases the risk of it happening. There is no evidence yet to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine increases the chances of these clots. But, even if it does, the next thing you have to take into account is whether Covid presents more of a danger. Regulators in Europe and the UK are clear - given the current evidence - that use of the vaccine should continue in all ages. Health Minister Jens Spahn and the 16 state health ministers decided to suspend routine use for the under-60s at an emergency meeting on Tuesday. People under 60 can still receive the jab but only ""at the discretion of doctors, and after individual risk analysis and thorough explanation"", according to a document seen by dpa news agency. The decision was reached on the advice of the German vaccine committee (Stiko) which said: ""After several consultations, Stiko, with the help of external experts, decided by a majority to recommend the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine only for persons aged 60 years and older on the basis of available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects."" Additional advice about booster shots would be issued by the end of April for younger persons who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca, Stiko said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there must be no doubts about the safety of any drug being administered in Germany: ""We have to be able to trust the vaccines... This also includes the subsequent ongoing testing of their effectiveness and safety, and the permanent weighing of risks and benefits. Confidence arises from the knowledge that every suspicion is counted in every individual case."" Mrs Merkel said: ""I have said when it is my turn, I will get vaccinated, also with AstraZeneca"" The 66-year-old added that she was open to being vaccinated with AstraZeneca when her turn came. Ahead of  announcement, the German cities of Berlin and Munich, and the region of Brandenburg, halted use of the vaccine for people below the age of 60. Germany was one of the European states which briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab earlier this month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots. When the EMA declared the vaccine ""safe and effective"", Germany and others resumed its use but investigations continued. The German medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has found 31 cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) among people who received AstraZeneca in Germany. Almost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women. France already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55. On Monday,Canada recommended immediately suspending the use of AstraZeneca in people aged below 55,externalfollowing the reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots in Europe, CBC reports. There have been no reports of blood clots related to the jab in Canada itself, where 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca jabs have now been administered. In the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - have been recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In another development, Austria confirmed it was in talks with Russia to buy a million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine, which has yet to be approved by the EMA. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is under pressure from opposition parties for his government's failure to buy its full share of vaccines under the EU's collective purchasing scheme. ""There must be no geopolitical blinkers regarding vaccines,"" Mr Kurz said in a statement issued by his office. ""The only thing that must count is whether the vaccine is effective and safe."" Despite the lack of EMA approval, Sputnik is already being used by fellow EU state Hungary.

Mrs Merkel said: ""I have said when it is my turn, I will get vaccinated, also with AstraZeneca"" The 66-year-old added that she was open to being vaccinated with AstraZeneca when her turn came. Ahead of  announcement, the German cities of Berlin and Munich, and the region of Brandenburg, halted use of the vaccine for people below the age of 60. Germany was one of the European states which briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab earlier this month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots. When the EMA declared the vaccine ""safe and effective"", Germany and others resumed its use but investigations continued. The German medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has found 31 cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) among people who received AstraZeneca in Germany. Almost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women. France already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55. On Monday,Canada recommended immediately suspending the use of AstraZeneca in people aged below 55,externalfollowing the reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots in Europe, CBC reports. There have been no reports of blood clots related to the jab in Canada itself, where 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca jabs have now been administered. In the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - have been recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine.

In another development, Austria confirmed it was in talks with Russia to buy a million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine, which has yet to be approved by the EMA. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is under pressure from opposition parties for his government's failure to buy its full share of vaccines under the EU's collective purchasing scheme. ""There must be no geopolitical blinkers regarding vaccines,"" Mr Kurz said in a statement issued by his office. ""The only thing that must count is whether the vaccine is effective and safe.""

"The leaders of Scotland's five larger political parties have taken part their first head-to-head TV debate of this election campaign Those taking part are Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Lorna Slater (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold an independence referendum in the first half of the new Holyrood parliament But Conservative Mr Ross believes a focus on independence is taking away from education and the pandemic recovery Labour's Mr Sarwar insists Scotland needs an NHS restart plan with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services Ms Slater of the Scottish Greens backs a referendum happening within the next Scottish Parliament term Lib Dem Mr Rennie says the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways and the next Holyrood government needs to make sure primary care has proper investment BBC Scotland News Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Lorna Slater, for the Scottish Greens, claimed to have ""won"" the
4% pay increase offered by the Scottish government to NHS workers (other than
doctors), as part of the deal between the SNP and Greens on the 2020-21 budget. This is not fully supported in published letters. When the deal was
struck earlier this month, Kate Forbes, the SNP's finance secretary, wrote to
the Greens saying she would prioritise pay for public sector workers when
allocating additional funds that had just been released by the Treasury. The
reply from the Greens recognised the SNP had already gone further on public
sector pay than the Treasury, and said its understanding with Ms Forbes was
that it would go further still. But there was no figure put on that,
recognising also that is a matter for pay negotiations. It also said the pay offer
should go to public sector workers more widely, dependent on Scottish
government funding, but the deal offered last week only covered the NHS. It was
one of the less clear-cut budget achievements by the Greens. In these negotiations,
the smaller party is usually pushing the governing party to go further in a
direction it would wish to go anyway. The commitment to increased pay was an agreement
with the SNP rather than a compromise. Prof John Curtice told the BBC News channel that Brexit was not mentioned during the debate but it had changed the character of support for the parties in Scotland in the past five years. He said the Conservatives did not not do very well among Remain voters. However, the SNP is much more popular among Remain voters than Leave supporters, while support for independence is higher among Remain voters than Leavers, Prof Curtice says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor We got a foretaste tonight of the
six-week campaign to come and a big reminder of the fault line in Scottish politics - the constitutional question of whether Scotland should be an independent country and whether it should have a referendum in the next parliament. The first minister confirmed she would like to have
that in the first half of the parliament if the pandemic crisis has passed. What the
definition of that is we donât know though. The Scottish Greens are also happy to have it at some
point but are not boxing themselves in on timing. The other parties are opposed, with Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservatives' leader, working hard to be the most oppositional of the opposition leaders. He said he didnât
want to work with a party like the SNP because it supports independence. For that, the
Scottish Labour leader Anar Sarwar told Mr Ross to ""grow up"", because Mr Sarwar supports a more co-operational politics despite the
constitutional divide. I think Nicola Sturgeon, perhaps unsurprisingly, looks a bit tired â she is the leader of the Scottish government, was on government business
today and has been leading the efforts to tackle the pandemic over the last year. She can still command
the details across the range of different
policies and she demonstrated that tonight. As the incumbent leader, she is
attacked from all sides and that takes some endurance over the course of an hour
or so. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a noisy exchange, Douglas Ross accused the SNP of failing
to fulfil its promise to reform council tax, while Nicola Sturgeon protested
(though parts of it were not audible)that it had been frozen while the SNP has
been in office and is lower in Scotland. Both were right. In 2007, the
incoming SNP administration said the ""hated council tax"" would go and be
replaced with a local income tax. As a minority administration, it failed to
get sufficient support for that. When it got a majority in 2011, it had gone
cold on the idea. Instead, it froze council tax for nine years, then allowed councils to raise it, and then froze it last year and for 2021-22. The SNP
leader was arguing that council tax is lower in Scotland. At Band D, the
average Scottish bill in 2020-21 is Â£1,308, in Wales it is Â£1,667 and in England
it is Â£1,818. Polling expert Prof John Curtice tells the BBC News channel that politics is about presenting a ""big narrative"". He says he is not sure any of the party leaders painted a clear picture of the kind of country they wanted to create. Prof Curtice says Boris Johnson won the 2019 general election by constantly reiterating ""Get Brexit Done"". There was nothing similar here, he says, and there is a danger their policies will ""wash over the people of Scotland"". Studio guests John Curtice, Lesley Riddoch and Pamela Nash Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, told the BBC News channel that the vast majority of people think Covid recovery should be the priority in this election - not another independence referendum. Broadcaster and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says the debate did not feel very balanced because it had three questions at the start suggesting it is impossible to move forward with an independence plan while we are in a pandemic. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said he thought that the leaders on the panel kept coming back to the issue of whether Scotland should be contemplating a referendum no matter what the question was actually about. ""Tonight, it emphasises the way the constitutional question is going to dominate this campaign despite what people like Pamela argue,"" Prof Curtice says. He says Tory leader Douglas Ross, who is against an independence referendum, was just as eager to talk about it as Nicola Sturgeon.  Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was challenged by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross on why all schoolchildren had been offered free devices at the start of the election campaign (a key SNP pledge this week) rather than at the start of the pandemic when they needed them. Ms Sturgeon responded that at the start of the pandemic they had been concentrating on those most in need and had discovered that there were 70,000 young people who needed devices but didnât have them. She said âso far just short of 70,000 devicesâ¦ rightly and properly those devices have been delivered to people in needâ. Arelease from the Scottish government,externalsaid that at the end of January 63,382 devices and 11,846 connectivity packages had been distributed to learners across Scotland and âit is expected that over 70,000 individuals will benefit in totalâ. Anas Sarwarsays from his own experience as an ethnic minority
politician, everyone has a duty to condemn perpetrators of abuse and show solidarity with the
victims. That is a ""cast-iron commitment from me"", he says. Willie Renniesays it is depressing that we
get to such a state in politics that we have to resort to abuse to get points
across. Politicians should work together and stand together every single time, he says, and ""I can guarantee I will act in the
right way"". Douglas Rosssays he was doing an interview today when one person walked past saying they wanted to shoot him, and another wanted a socially-distant selfie. That is the nature
of Scottish politics â ""we are so divided"", he says - but adds that everyone can agree they would take
urgent action if abuse was highlighted. Lorna Slatersays we need a parliament which ""really reflects the people of Scotland"", with a proper gender balance and more women, ethnic minorities and trans people. We have âtoo many old, wealthy, white men making
decisions"" , she says, and highlights the Scottish Greens' candidate list is 70%
women. Nicola Sturgeonsays she will call out abuse ""whenever it
needs to be called out"". Politicians must recognise their responsibilities and not just call it out when it involves another party, she says. None of us are perfect on
this, she adds, but says the leaders must ""rise to the occasion"" and focus on what they can agree on rather than the ""legitimate differences"" between
us. Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the Scottish governmentâs measures to reduce emissions. She said: â97% of our electricity already comes from renewable sources so we should take that as motivation to go further.â It is true that in 2020, the equivalent of 97.4% of Scotland's electricity demand came from renewables.
 
Thatâs an impressive increase from the figure of 24% in 2010. But it should be mentioned that the Scottish governmentâs target, set in 2011, was to achieve 100% from renewable sources last year. That target was narrowly missed. Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland environment correspondent In an age of polarised politics, tackling the self-declared climate crisis has been a rare point of unity for MSPs in the parliamentary term which has just ended.  The only debate was how quickly we do it. Scottish Labour wanted it faster than the SNP; the Scottish Greens even speedier.  But that doesnât set anyone apart in an election campaign. In the leaders debate, though, there was a moment of polarisation between the Tories and the Greens. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross lauded the Â£16bn North Sea transition deal designed to secure a future for oil and gas workers.  âMore money for oil and gas?â questioned an indignant Scottish Greensâ co-leader Lorna Slater. In reality, the transition deal is a lot more nuanced than that and the politicians know it. The Lib Dems spoke of the importance of a so called ""just transition"" where communities are not harmed by decarbonisation. That canât be achieved if the North Sea sector is shut down tomorrow. Scottish Greens co-leaderLorna Slatersays the climate crisis has to be the number one concern and only her party has the solutions. She says we should not just dabble in climate measures - instead we have to ""do everything all at once now"". Ms Slater calls for moves to drive carbon emissions down as quickly as we can. She says she wants to invest in renewable energy and in Scotland's homes and public transport. Douglas Rossof the Scottish Tories says he hopes the Scottish government will work with the UK government on the North Sea transition deal which will see tens of thousands of jobs protected as they move from oil and gas into more renewable energy. Mr Ross cannot say when he thinks North Sea oil and gas production will cease but says the UK is working with the industry. Scottish Labour'sAnas Sarwarsays the world will be watching Glasgow in November when the COP26 climate change conference comes to Glasgow. He says we have got to make sure it shows the best of Glasgow and the best of Scotland. SNP leaderNicola Sturgeonsays Scotland already leads the world in carbon emission reductions, with some of the most stretching targets anywhere. She says we have to match what we have done in electricity generation with action in other areas such as how we heat our homes. MS Sturgeon says the SNP manifesto will have proposals on that. Scottish Lib Dem leaderWillie Renniesays we need the same national purpose on climate change as we have had on Covid. The pandemic has shown we don't need to use our cars as much, we can do much more remotely, he says. Mr Rennie says it is a travesty that we are about to build a huge wind farm offshore off Fife and Scotland did not get any of the work to build them. Chris ClementsSocial Affairs Correspondent, The Nine After a downward trend since the 1990s, child poverty in Scotland has been on the rise for the past few years. Figures released last week revealed that, before Covid, a quarter of all children in Scotland - around 240,000 - were living below the breadline. Two thirds of them come from families who are in work.
The pandemic has likely made that problem worse. In the last year, the number of people claiming Universal Credit in Scotland doubled - suggesting many families are struggling. Nicola Sturgeon said a rise in poverty is due to an âassaultâ on welfare by Westminster. She wants to double her partyâs flagship top-up Child Payment - raising it to Â£20 a week for each child under six in families claiming benefits. However, that payment was only introduced last month. It also still needs to be rolled out for older children by the end of 2022. Other parties such as the Lib Dems say the benefit should have been introduced much earlier during the SNPâs tenure. Child poverty rates remain lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK. But Scotland has set itself tough targets - by 2030, only 10 per cent of children should be in relative poverty. At the moment, the numbers are going in the wrong direction. Willie Renniesays yes, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats argued for it during the pandemic. Scottish Conservatives leaderDouglas Rossis not convinced
of the argument for it. Lorna Slatersays the Scottish Greens are committed
to working towards it and will support trials of it in the next parliament. Anas Sarwarsays yes, Scottish Labour
supports it and the pandemic was a missed opportunity to trial it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the
pandemic has made her more supportive of it, but the reality of not having full
control over tax and social security is that it cannot be done fully in Scotland. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Willie Rennie says the process of independence for Scotland
would be âjust like Brexitâ. Would it? That depends on how it is handled. The problems with negotiating Brexit were largely tied up with the British
government wishing to remove itself from the single market and customs union.
It is not clear that Scotland would wish to remove itself from the single
market and customs union with the rest of the UK. If the leadership at Holyrood
wishes instead to re-join the European single market, it may have to make a
significant break from the UKâs market regulation and rules. Another feature of
the Brexit negotiations was that the European Commission fought hard to protect
its members' interests, and to send a signal that leaving the EU would come at a
cost for others who might choose to do so. That would be less of a concern for
Downing Street in negotiating on Scottish independence. But having lost the
battle to persuade Scots to stay in the Union, leaders at Westminster could
negotiate hard in the interests of the rest of the UK. And as the European
Commission did, they could press home the negotiating advantages as the larger,
more powerful partner in a split. Such ""what if?"" arguments become highly
hypothetical. As Glasgow prepares to host the COP26 climate conference, what will you do to ensure Scotland's contribution to reducing the global rate of warming to pre-industrial levels?""  Reality Check In the debate Willie Rennie said: âWeâve got 1500 young people who are waiting for mental health support for over a yearâ The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader is right with this claim.
 
The most recent official waiting times statistics for Scotlandâs child and adolescent mental health services (known as Camhs) showed that in December there were 1,560 patients who had waited more than 52 weeks. This equates to about 14% of patients,according to Public Health Scotland,external. Anas Sarwarsays Scotland needs an NHS restart plan
with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services, so they
are accessible in GP practices and workplaces. The Scottish Labour leader welcomes
the proposed 4% pay rise for NHS staff, and says social care staff should also get a pay
rise. Douglas Rosssays although we are getting close to
10,000 lives being lost in Scotland, a figure âwhich shames us allâ, it would have
been higher if not for the incredible efforts of NHS staff. The governmentâs
treatment time guarantee has never been met while Nicola Sturgeon has been
first minister, he adds. Nicola Sturgeonsays the government
has invested three times as much as they committed to in the NHS. The first
minister has been working on plans for temporary operating facilities and
mobile units to bring down the backlog, with six permanent elective centres âin
trainâ, and three will be operational by the end of May, she adds. Willie Renniesays the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways
and we need to make sure primary care has proper investment and mental health
services are up to scratch so they are not putting pressure on the service. Professionals, not politicians, should be in charge of setting targets for dealing with the backlog of operations, he adds. Lorna Slatersays every party is committed to an investment-led
recovery, but the question is what are we investing in? Boris Johnson can find
the money to buy nuclear weapons, but not to give nurses a pay rise, she says.
Ms Slater is happy to hear there is consensus on a national care service, which
will reduce pressure on the NHS. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to use the next five years to
try to get back into the EU single market.  'Trying' to do so is a
significant qualification. That would require Scotland to leave the UK, then to
have autonomy to negotiate a new relationship with the European Union - either
as a full member state or perhaps, like Norway, as part of the European
Economic Area. It's not clear what would be required, as no country has done
this before: currently having full alignment with EU market rules, which should
make convergence simple and then negotiating re-engagement. It is not clear
what terms the EU would place on that. And one criticism of the plan is that it
would put the frontier of the European single market on the border between
Scotland and England, which is a more important market for Scottish business
than all overseas countries put together. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Itâs a big question, how does the NHS get back on track after the pandemic? Psychiatrists are warning of a huge mental health crisis in a service already struggling to cope with demand.

There are concerns about the impact on cancer services. All but urgent surgery was postponed in the first wave and there are waits to get key diagnostic tests. Doctors worry about those who have symptoms but have put off coming forward.

For more routine treatments, doctors are being asked to prioritise those most in need, but that inevitably means others will experience long, long waits. By far the biggest share of the Scottish budget is already being spent on health and Covid will continue to put pressure on the health service in the months to come. So itâs a very difficult question for all parties, how to get more out of the NHS? Â© 2025 BBC.

She wants to double her partyâs flagship top-up Child Payment - raising it to Â£20 a week for each child under six in families claiming benefits. However, that payment was only introduced last month. It also still needs to be rolled out for older children by the end of 2022. Other parties such as the Lib Dems say the benefit should have been introduced much earlier during the SNPâs tenure. Child poverty rates remain lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK. But Scotland has set itself tough targets - by 2030, only 10 per cent of children should be in relative poverty. At the moment, the numbers are going in the wrong direction. Willie Renniesays yes, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats argued for it during the pandemic. Scottish Conservatives leaderDouglas Rossis not convinced
of the argument for it. Lorna Slatersays the Scottish Greens are committed
to working towards it and will support trials of it in the next parliament. Anas Sarwarsays yes, Scottish Labour
supports it and the pandemic was a missed opportunity to trial it. Nicola Sturgeonsays the
pandemic has made her more supportive of it, but the reality of not having full
control over tax and social security is that it cannot be done fully in Scotland. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Willie Rennie says the process of independence for Scotland
would be âjust like Brexitâ. Would it? That depends on how it is handled. The problems with negotiating Brexit were largely tied up with the British
government wishing to remove itself from the single market and customs union.
It is not clear that Scotland would wish to remove itself from the single
market and customs union with the rest of the UK. If the leadership at Holyrood
wishes instead to re-join the European single market, it may have to make a
significant break from the UKâs market regulation and rules. Another feature of
the Brexit negotiations was that the European Commission fought hard to protect
its members' interests, and to send a signal that leaving the EU would come at a
cost for others who might choose to do so. That would be less of a concern for
Downing Street in negotiating on Scottish independence. But having lost the
battle to persuade Scots to stay in the Union, leaders at Westminster could
negotiate hard in the interests of the rest of the UK. And as the European
Commission did, they could press home the negotiating advantages as the larger,
more powerful partner in a split. Such ""what if?"" arguments become highly
hypothetical. As Glasgow prepares to host the COP26 climate conference, what will you do to ensure Scotland's contribution to reducing the global rate of warming to pre-industrial levels?""  Reality Check In the debate Willie Rennie said: âWeâve got 1500 young people who are waiting for mental health support for over a yearâ The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader is right with this claim.
 
The most recent official waiting times statistics for Scotlandâs child and adolescent mental health services (known as Camhs) showed that in December there were 1,560 patients who had waited more than 52 weeks. This equates to about 14% of patients,according to Public Health Scotland,external. Anas Sarwarsays Scotland needs an NHS restart plan
with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services, so they
are accessible in GP practices and workplaces. The Scottish Labour leader welcomes
the proposed 4% pay rise for NHS staff, and says social care staff should also get a pay
rise. Douglas Rosssays although we are getting close to
10,000 lives being lost in Scotland, a figure âwhich shames us allâ, it would have
been higher if not for the incredible efforts of NHS staff. The governmentâs
treatment time guarantee has never been met while Nicola Sturgeon has been
first minister, he adds. Nicola Sturgeonsays the government
has invested three times as much as they committed to in the NHS. The first
minister has been working on plans for temporary operating facilities and
mobile units to bring down the backlog, with six permanent elective centres âin
trainâ, and three will be operational by the end of May, she adds. Willie Renniesays the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways
and we need to make sure primary care has proper investment and mental health
services are up to scratch so they are not putting pressure on the service. Professionals, not politicians, should be in charge of setting targets for dealing with the backlog of operations, he adds. Lorna Slatersays every party is committed to an investment-led
recovery, but the question is what are we investing in? Boris Johnson can find
the money to buy nuclear weapons, but not to give nurses a pay rise, she says.
Ms Slater is happy to hear there is consensus on a national care service, which
will reduce pressure on the NHS. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to use the next five years to
try to get back into the EU single market.  'Trying' to do so is a
significant qualification. That would require Scotland to leave the UK, then to
have autonomy to negotiate a new relationship with the European Union - either
as a full member state or perhaps, like Norway, as part of the European
Economic Area. It's not clear what would be required, as no country has done
this before: currently having full alignment with EU market rules, which should
make convergence simple and then negotiating re-engagement. It is not clear
what terms the EU would place on that. And one criticism of the plan is that it
would put the frontier of the European single market on the border between
Scotland and England, which is a more important market for Scottish business
than all overseas countries put together. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Itâs a big question, how does the NHS get back on track after the pandemic? Psychiatrists are warning of a huge mental health crisis in a service already struggling to cope with demand.

There are concerns about the impact on cancer services. All but urgent surgery was postponed in the first wave and there are waits to get key diagnostic tests. Doctors worry about those who have symptoms but have put off coming forward.

For more routine treatments, doctors are being asked to prioritise those most in need, but that inevitably means others will experience long, long waits. By far the biggest share of the Scottish budget is already being spent on health and Covid will continue to put pressure on the health service in the months to come. So itâs a very difficult question for all parties, how to get more out of the NHS? Â© 2025 BBC.

"The leaders of Scotland's five larger political parties have taken part their first head-to-head TV debate of this election campaign Those taking part are Nicola Sturgeon (SNP); Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives); Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour); Lorna Slater (Scottish Greens) and Willie Rennie (Scottish Lib Dems) Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold an independence referendum in the first half of the new Holyrood parliament But Conservative Mr Ross believes a focus on independence is taking away from education and the pandemic recovery Labour's Mr Sarwar insists Scotland needs an NHS restart plan with dedicated cancer centres and investment in mental health services Ms Slater of the Scottish Greens backs a referendum happening within the next Scottish Parliament term Lib Dem Mr Rennie says the pandemic has knocked the NHS sideways and the next Holyrood government needs to make sure primary care has proper investment BBC Scotland News Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Lorna Slater, for the Scottish Greens, claimed to have ""won"" the
4% pay increase offered by the Scottish government to NHS workers (other than
doctors), as part of the deal between the SNP and Greens on the 2020-21 budget. This is not fully supported in published letters. When the deal was
struck earlier this month, Kate Forbes, the SNP's finance secretary, wrote to
the Greens saying she would prioritise pay for public sector workers when
allocating additional funds that had just been released by the Treasury. The
reply from the Greens recognised the SNP had already gone further on public
sector pay than the Treasury, and said its understanding with Ms Forbes was
that it would go further still. But there was no figure put on that,
recognising also that is a matter for pay negotiations. It also said the pay offer
should go to public sector workers more widely, dependent on Scottish
government funding, but the deal offered last week only covered the NHS. It was
one of the less clear-cut budget achievements by the Greens. In these negotiations,
the smaller party is usually pushing the governing party to go further in a
direction it would wish to go anyway. The commitment to increased pay was an agreement
with the SNP rather than a compromise. Prof John Curtice told the BBC News channel that Brexit was not mentioned during the debate but it had changed the character of support for the parties in Scotland in the past five years. He said the Conservatives did not not do very well among Remain voters. However, the SNP is much more popular among Remain voters than Leave supporters, while support for independence is higher among Remain voters than Leavers, Prof Curtice says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor We got a foretaste tonight of the
six-week campaign to come and a big reminder of the fault line in Scottish politics - the constitutional question of whether Scotland should be an independent country and whether it should have a referendum in the next parliament. The first minister confirmed she would like to have
that in the first half of the parliament if the pandemic crisis has passed. What the
definition of that is we donât know though. The Scottish Greens are also happy to have it at some
point but are not boxing themselves in on timing. The other parties are opposed, with Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservatives' leader, working hard to be the most oppositional of the opposition leaders. He said he didnât
want to work with a party like the SNP because it supports independence. For that, the
Scottish Labour leader Anar Sarwar told Mr Ross to ""grow up"", because Mr Sarwar supports a more co-operational politics despite the
constitutional divide. I think Nicola Sturgeon, perhaps unsurprisingly, looks a bit tired â she is the leader of the Scottish government, was on government business
today and has been leading the efforts to tackle the pandemic over the last year. She can still command
the details across the range of different
policies and she demonstrated that tonight. As the incumbent leader, she is
attacked from all sides and that takes some endurance over the course of an hour
or so. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a noisy exchange, Douglas Ross accused the SNP of failing
to fulfil its promise to reform council tax, while Nicola Sturgeon protested
(though parts of it were not audible)that it had been frozen while the SNP has
been in office and is lower in Scotland. Both were right. In 2007, the
incoming SNP administration said the ""hated council tax"" would go and be
replaced with a local income tax. As a minority administration, it failed to
get sufficient support for that. When it got a majority in 2011, it had gone
cold on the idea. Instead, it froze council tax for nine years, then allowed councils to raise it, and then froze it last year and for 2021-22. The SNP
leader was arguing that council tax is lower in Scotland. At Band D, the
average Scottish bill in 2020-21 is Â£1,308, in Wales it is Â£1,667 and in England
it is Â£1,818. Polling expert Prof John Curtice tells the BBC News channel that politics is about presenting a ""big narrative"". He says he is not sure any of the party leaders painted a clear picture of the kind of country they wanted to create. Prof Curtice says Boris Johnson won the 2019 general election by constantly reiterating ""Get Brexit Done"". There was nothing similar here, he says, and there is a danger their policies will ""wash over the people of Scotland"". Studio guests John Curtice, Lesley Riddoch and Pamela Nash Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, told the BBC News channel that the vast majority of people think Covid recovery should be the priority in this election - not another independence referendum. Broadcaster and independence campaigner Lesley Riddoch says the debate did not feel very balanced because it had three questions at the start suggesting it is impossible to move forward with an independence plan while we are in a pandemic. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said he thought that the leaders on the panel kept coming back to the issue of whether Scotland should be contemplating a referendum no matter what the question was actually about. ""Tonight, it emphasises the way the constitutional question is going to dominate this campaign despite what people like Pamela argue,"" Prof Curtice says. He says Tory leader Douglas Ross, who is against an independence referendum, was just as eager to talk about it as Nicola Sturgeon.  Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was challenged by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross on why all schoolchildren had been offered free devices at the start of the election campaign (a key SNP pledge this week) rather than at the start of the pandemic when they needed them. Ms Sturgeon responded that at the start of the pandemic they had been concentrating on those most in need and had discovered that there were 70,000 young people who needed devices but didnât have them. She said âso far just short of 70,000 devicesâ¦ rightly and properly those devices have been delivered to people in needâ. Arelease from the Scottish government,externalsaid that at the end of January 63,382 devices and 11,846 connectivity packages had been distributed to learners across Scotland and âit is expected that over 70,000 individuals will benefit in totalâ. Anas Sarwarsays from his own experience as an ethnic minority
politician, everyone has a duty to condemn perpetrators of abuse and show solidarity with the
victims. That is a ""cast-iron commitment from me"", he says. Willie Renniesays it is depressing that we
get to such a state in politics that we have to resort to abuse to get points
across. Politicians should work together and stand together every single time, he says, and ""I can guarantee I will act in the
right way"". Douglas Rosssays he was doing an interview today when one person walked past saying they wanted to shoot him, and another wanted a socially-distant selfie. That is the nature
of Scottish politics â ""we are so divided"", he says - but adds that everyone can agree they would take
urgent action if abuse was highlighted. Lorna Slatersays we need a parliament which ""really reflects the people of Scotland"", with a proper gender balance and more women, ethnic minorities and trans people. We have âtoo many old, wealthy, white men making
decisions"" , she says, and highlights the Scottish Greens' candidate list is 70%
women. Nicola Sturgeonsays she will call out abuse ""whenever it
needs to be called out"". Politicians must recognise their responsibilities and not just call it out when it involves another party, she says. None of us are perfect on
this, she adds, but says the leaders must ""rise to the occasion"" and focus on what they can agree on rather than the ""legitimate differences"" between
us. Reality Check First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the Scottish governmentâs measures to reduce emissions. She said: â97% of our electricity already comes from renewable sources so we should take that as motivation to go further.â It is true that in 2020, the equivalent of 97.4% of Scotland's electricity demand came from renewables.
 
Thatâs an impressive increase from the figure of 24% in 2010. But it should be mentioned that the Scottish governmentâs target, set in 2011, was to achieve 100% from renewable sources last year. That target was narrowly missed. Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland environment correspondent In an age of polarised politics, tackling the self-declared climate crisis has been a rare point of unity for MSPs in the parliamentary term which has just ended.  The only debate was how quickly we do it. Scottish Labour wanted it faster than the SNP; the Scottish Greens even speedier.  But that doesnât set anyone apart in an election campaign. In the leaders debate, though, there was a moment of polarisation between the Tories and the Greens. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross lauded the Â£16bn North Sea transition deal designed to secure a future for oil and gas workers.  âMore money for oil and gas?â questioned an indignant Scottish Greensâ co-leader Lorna Slater. In reality, the transition deal is a lot more nuanced than that and the politicians know it. The Lib Dems spoke of the importance of a so called ""just transition"" where communities are not harmed by decarbonisation. That canât be achieved if the North Sea sector is shut down tomorrow. Scottish Greens co-leaderLorna Slatersays the climate crisis has to be the number one concern and only her party has the solutions. She says we should not just dabble in climate measures - instead we have to ""do everything all at once now"". Ms Slater calls for moves to drive carbon emissions down as quickly as we can. She says she wants to invest in renewable energy and in Scotland's homes and public transport. Douglas Rossof the Scottish Tories says he hopes the Scottish government will work with the UK government on the North Sea transition deal which will see tens of thousands of jobs protected as they move from oil and gas into more renewable energy. Mr Ross cannot say when he thinks North Sea oil and gas production will cease but says the UK is working with the industry. Scottish Labour'sAnas Sarwarsays the world will be watching Glasgow in November when the COP26 climate change conference comes to Glasgow. He says we have got to make sure it shows the best of Glasgow and the best of Scotland. SNP leaderNicola Sturgeonsays Scotland already leads the world in carbon emission reductions, with some of the most stretching targets anywhere. She says we have to match what we have done in electricity generation with action in other areas such as how we heat our homes. MS Sturgeon says the SNP manifesto will have proposals on that. Scottish Lib Dem leaderWillie Renniesays we need the same national purpose on climate change as we have had on Covid. The pandemic has shown we don't need to use our cars as much, we can do much more remotely, he says. Mr Rennie says it is a travesty that we are about to build a huge wind farm offshore off Fife and Scotland did not get any of the work to build them. Chris ClementsSocial Affairs Correspondent, The Nine After a downward trend since the 1990s, child poverty in Scotland has been on the rise for the past few years. Figures released last week revealed that, before Covid, a quarter of all children in Scotland - around 240,000 - were living below the breadline. Two thirds of them come from families who are in work.
The pandemic has likely made that problem worse. In the last year, the number of people claiming Universal Credit in Scotland doubled - suggesting many families are struggling. Nicola Sturgeon said a rise in poverty is due to an âassaultâ on welfare by Westminster. She wants to double her partyâs flagship top-up Child Payment - raising it to Â£20 a week for each child under six in families claiming benefits. However, that payment was only introduced last month. It also still needs to be rolled out for older children by the end of 2022.

"This video can not be played Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen blamed a ""selfish minority"" for the ""extremely disappointing"" scenes Police have warned people to stick to coronavirus rules after large crowds were seen brawling and drinking in a city park on the day restrictions eased. Videos shared on social media showed some hugging and others pushing and shoving at Nottingham Arboretum. One local resident described the scenes on Monday as ""horrendous"". Police said they had now put a dispersal order in place to prevent similar scenes over the next few days. Since Monday morning, two households or groups of up to six people have been allowed to meet outside in England. Police believe the warm weather brought more people out Footage appeared to show multiple instances of social distancing being ignored as large numbers began gathering from the afternoon and stayed into the evening. One video showed people pushing and shoving each other and a large amount of litter was left behind. ""Last night it was horrendous seeing what was going on,"" the resident told BBC Radio Nottingham. ""I walked past on the way to the shop and it was just madness. It seems like a real joke when people are still struggling. ""Staying late, leaving all this rubbish. Every single element of it is completely selfish."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? What is the rule of six and what are the social distancing rules? Mature student Thomas Scott, who was in the Aboretum on Monday evening, said: ""I felt it was utterly disrespectful. ""There were probably 800 to 1,200 people. When they got kicked out everyone left their rubbish on site."" Pat Robinson, of the Arboretum Residents' Association, said the main culprits were students. She said: ""We are living on a student campus, and they treat the area appallingly. ""I saw so many drunken students, climbing over the railings of the Arboretum, screaming and shouting. There were signs saying no alcohol, but no-one was enforcing it."" The University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University have both been approached for comment. Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he was working with ""partners"" at Nottingham's universities because ""we think that a good number of the people there [on Monday] were students"". Police officers were stopping people at the Arboretum gates on Tuesday to check for alcohol He added: ""Monday was the first day that people could go and meet with more than one other person. ""To see that exploited and people behaving in such an unruly fashion is just so disappointing, and it's dangerous to our community."" As a result of the scenes on Monday, officers were seen stopping people at the Arboretum gates checking bags for alcohol, which is prohibited under a public spaces protection order. The most recent figures show Nottingham had a coronavirus infection rate of 72.7 per 100,000 people in the week up to 26 March - higher than the national average of 54.7. For a period in October, the city also had the highest infection rate in the UK. Earlier this monthNottinghamshire Police brought in dispersal ordersin Lenton and the Arboretum to prevent further flouting of lockdown rules after reports of anti-social behaviour and house parties. Overflowing bins and discarded litter were seen on Tuesday morning Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cooper said: ""While we can of course understand people's desire to want to be out in the sun and enjoying these mild temperatures we are currently experiencing, the government and our health colleagues remain extremely cautious and advise that people continue to minimise social contact. ""We would like to remind people that we are still only partly out of lockdown measures. ""We are aware of a number of residents choosing to be out in the Arboretum. The behaviour yesterday was unacceptable and we are disappointed people decided to behave in this selfish way. That is why we have now taken the decision to put a dispersal order in place. ""It is up to us all to keep to the measures so we can continue on the roadmap out of lockdown, by keeping the virus at bay."" Signs have been added warning people alcohol is forbidden at the park Mr Mellen added: ""Over 600 local people have died due to the virus. ""We have had discussions with senior police officers and there will be increased presence in our parks. ""Drinking alcohol in public spaces is not permitted in Nottingham and will be seized on entry to our parks today.""

"London schools face allegations of cultivating 'rape culture' following an online campaign Students at private schools have said allegations of sexual abuse by fellow pupils have been ignored because staff wish to protect the reputation of the school - and the income associated with its prestige. One girl, who says she was raped by a boy at school, said her teachers handed her allegation to the police before ""washing their hands of it to protect their image"". The debate about how our schools are run has escalated recently after a website was set up for victims topost anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered.There are even calls for a public inquiry. The number of allegations made by pupils on the Everyone's Invited websitenow number in their thousands, with children as young as nine posting testimonies claiming assault, harassment and rape. Many of the claims are made by young women about the young men who are at school or college or university with them, or part of the same social groups. Speaking anonymously, an 18-year-old girl told the BBC she was raped by a boy who was ""one of the brightest students"" at her school, the name of which she did not disclose. ""So therefore it was his needs above mine, they didn't want him to be removed,"" she said. ""They didn't want him to have his prefect badge taken away because it would affect his future. ""And they want to be able to say, oh, yeah, we taught this child and they were so bright, so they didn't do anything. He didn't get any sanctions. They just didn't want to get in his way. ""I've been on anti-depressants for a year and almost went on anti-anxiety tablets to help with my sleeping because obviously that's been affected"". One former pupil says she was ignored when she took her claims of abuse to teachers The girl's mother believes ""there was a fear of what other people, families, parents might think. ""And if you think about a private school, they need people to be coming to pay their bills. They need the next intake,"" she said. ""And if they are embroiled in a scandal, that's going to have an impact on them"". Highgate School in north London is among the private schools caught up in the claims. A former student of the school says when she took her claims to staff, she was ignored: ""A friend raped me at a party in Year 13 [upper sixth]. ""I reported the rape to the school eight days afterwards - and so began their massive failure to support me. ""In a meeting with my parents, a senior member of staff said 'alcohol was involved', suggesting that this made my situation less legitimate. ""I was told that it was merely my word against his."" Website exposes 'rape culture' at schools Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' 'Rape culture' warning as 8,000 report school abuse BBC Newsnight has seen a several-page dossier containing hundreds of testimonies saying similar things. The school said it is launching an ""immediate external review of the sexual abuse and harassment allegations"" and is ""working on an anti-sexism plan"". Private schools partly rely on private financing through their fees - some of those listed on the Everyone's Invited website charge more than Â£20,000 a year. Students from these schools often go to the best universities, so the fees are seen as a good investment and a guarantee of a good education. But there are calls for less focus on academia and more focus on behaviour and attitudes. Sir Anthony Seldon, former head of Wellington College, said more emphasis should be given to developing pupils' character Sir Anthony Seldon, the former head of the independent Wellington College, called the emerging scandal ""a horror"". ""We need to have a revitalised education system that really does the best for every child... instead of just giving them all the educational advantages but also the development of their holistic character, their creativity, their ability to be able to perform well in work and in society, knowing how to manage their mental health. ""I mean, goodness, school is about so much more than just tests and exams"". The Department for Education has reiterated it is working with the police to provide support and protection to those reporting abuse. The alleged victims are hoping that shining a very public light onto their claims can lead to change - but some fear when that spotlight is switched off, these changing attitudes could fade.

"The Ever Given was refloated after a salvage operation involving a flotilla of tug boats and dredgers Ships have started sailing through Egypt's Suez Canal again, a day after a giant container vessel blocking the vital trade route was freed. Thirty-seven ships that were struck at the midway point cleared the waterway overnight, while 70 others are due to travel its entire length on Tuesday. The canal authorities hope to clear the traffic jam of some 300 vessels waiting to use it within three-and-a-half days. Meanwhile, the freed ship will be inspected for seaworthiness by experts. The 400m-long (1,312ft), 200,000-tonne Ever Given became wedged diagonally across the canal a week ago after running aground amid high winds. It was refloated on Monday afternoon after a salvage operation involving a flotilla of powerful tug boats and dredging vessels that shifted 30,000 cubic metres (1,059,000 cubic ft) of mud and sand. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. At a news conference on Monday night, the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, declared that it would be running at full capacity to clear the backlog as soon as possible. ""We won't sleep. This is a new challenge we are working on,"" he said. ""We will work around the clock until we get through the ships. We have faith in this."" The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How was the Suez Canal ship freed? In pictures: The epic task of refloating Suez ship Canal services provider Leth Agencies said 306 vessels were waiting as of Tuesday morning - 163 at Suez in the Red Sea, 137 at Port Said in the Mediterranean, and six at the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water that marks the midway point. Forty-five ships are currently sailing southwards in two convoys, one of which will rendezvous with the six vessels in the lake, while 25 vessels are moving northwards from Suez. The average transit time is between 11 and 12 hours. The ship is anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, where it is undergoing ""an inspection of its seaworthiness"", according to its operator Evergreen Marine. ""The outcome of that inspection will determine whether the ship can resume its scheduled service,"" the Taiwanese company said on Monday. The Ever Given's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage. It added that initial investigations suggested the vessel ran aground due to strong wind. They also ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause. Authorities have left open the possibility of a technical or human error by the ship's crew or the two Egyptian canal pilots who were on board at the time. Container ships passed the city of Ismailia, located on the west bank of the canal, on Tuesday Mr Rabie said the incident was not simply the result of the weather, noting that many ships had passed through the waterway in worse conditions. ""The Suez Canal has never been closed because of bad weather,"" he stressed. He also denied size was a factor, saying larger ships had used the waterway. The blockage held up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day, according to data from Lloyd's List. Michelle Wiese Bockmann, an analyst at the shipping journal, told the BBC that the delays would not disappear quickly. ""It will take a couple of weeks to clear the backlog. And then, of course, you have the issue, especially with container ships, [of the vessels] all arriving at once at European ports, causing widespread congestion and delays that will trickle all the way down throughout the container shipping sector,"" said. ""It will delay empty boxes getting back to China and to Asia to load goods, and then there will be congestion at those ports."" With cargo vessels reaching their destinations much later than planned, future sailing schedules will also have been thrown into disarray, says BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett. Experts say the cost of shipping goods to Europe is likely to rise as a result. All of this comes at a time when delicately balanced supply chains are already struggling to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Further disruption simply raises the risk of delays, higher prices or even shortages for businesses and consumers, our correspondent adds.

"A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral on Tuesday The attendance of then-Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020 led to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored six months prior. Ms O'Neill and other senior Sinn FÃ©in figures were widely criticised for attending the funeral, with claims they broke coronavirus guidelines. A decision was later made by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in connection with the funeral. Previously, Ms O'Neill apologised for the hurt caused by her actions and any undermining of the public health message, but not for her attendance, having once said she would""never apologise for attending the funeral of a friend"". But in a u-turn in May 2024, Ms O'Neillapologised for her attendance at Mr Storey's funeraland the hurt that was caused as she gave evidence to the UK Covid Inquiry. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Bobby Storey was previously chairman of Sinn FÃ©in and a close friend of Gerry Adams The north Belfast man was considered the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s - being named as such under parliamentary privilege. Security sources linked him to several major incidents,including the Â£26m Northern Bank robbery in 2004.,external More recently, he was northern chairman of Sinn FÃ©in. He spent more than 20 years in jail, beginning with internment without trial when he was 17, a year after he joined the IRA in 1972. In 1981, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for possession of a rifle following an attack on the Army. He was a close and lifelong ally of former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams. When he was released from jail in 1994, Mr Storey was seen as a key individual in selling the peace process to republican hardliners. Mr Storey's coffin was driven from his home in west Belfast for his funeral at St Agnes' Church on the Andersonstown Road. Large numbers of people lined the route and the cortege was followed at a distance by a large number of mourners. After Requiem Mass, Mr Storey's remains were taken to Milltown Cemetery where speeches were made by senior republican figures including former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams. His body was then taken to Roselawn Cemetery in east Belfast, where it was cremated at about 15:30. Sinn FÃ©in's leader and deputy leader attended, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) Ms O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn FÃ©in said included no more than 30 people, Critics have suggested social distancing was not maintained in crowds that lined the streets as the hearse drove by or by large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance. Ms O'Neill also went to a Requiem Mass in St Agnes' Church in Andersonstown, which the BBC understands was attended by about 120 people. She was also criticised for posing for a photograph at Milltown cemetery, where a man had his arm around her shoulders. She subsequently said this incident took place ""in the blink of an eye"" and ""shouldn't have happened"". Critics were angry the then-deputy first minister, who appealed to the public during the pandemic to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, has now contravened the very rules she helped set. Immediately following the funeral, both the party and Ms O'Neill maintained they acted within the guidelines at all times and broke no rules. In statements to the Irish News and Stormont's Executive Committee, she did not apologise for any of her actions, with the exception of the photograph. Sinn FÃ©in gave her its full backing, saying she would not stand down ""under any circumstances"". Ms O'Neill later issued a statement expressing concern for families of those who had died in the pandemic whose grief would have been compounded by lockdown restrictions. ""Not being able to have their family and friends' support to help them through was hugely difficult,"" she said. ""I am also concerned that those grieving families are experiencing more hurt over recent days. I am sorry for that."" She reiterated that she had kept to the rules, adding: ""If the regulations had prevented me from attending his funeral I would have obeyed those regulations."" Her party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told RTÃ: ""I do understand that looking at the images of very busy pathways in west Belfast and taking all of that in obviously has jolted and has caused some hurt among some of those families, and for that I am very sorry. ""That certainly would never have been my intention, or Michelle's intention, or the intention of the Storey family as they laid Bobby to rest."" In September 2020,Ms O'Neill acknowledged Stormont's public health messaging was ""undermined""by the controversy. Following the announcement in March 2021 that nobody would be prosecuted in relation to the funeral, she apologised again ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief"". Giving evidence to the UK's public inquiry in May 2024, ex-Communities Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­naccepted she should not have attended the funeral. She said she was ""very sorry"" and acknowledged that her attendance had an impact on public confidence. Ms O'Neill also apologised at the inquiry for her attendance at Mr Storey's funeral while she was deputy first minister. ""My actions compounded the hurt, my actions also angered families I am sorry for going and I am sorry for the hurt that's been caused,"" she said. When asked by the chair Baroness Hallett if she was aware of the hurt and anger at the time, Ms O'Neill replied: ""I didn't and I ought to have."" Northern Ireland's system of government sees several parties share power in government together - at the time of the funeral these were the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance. Immediately following the funeral all the other parties called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside while investigations are carried out. The Green Party and Traditional Unionist Voice, which were not part of the government, also called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside. This video can not be played Arlene Foster called for Michelle O'Neill to apologise Former First Minister Arlene Foster, then-leader of the DUP, said she could not stand beside Ms O'Neill to give out public health advice after what had happened. The two women had been at the forefront of regular press conferences to update the people of Northern Ireland on the handling of the coronavirus crisis. They did not give a joint press conference again until September, after Ms O'Neill admitted her actions had undermined the health messaging. The Public Prosecution Service took a decision on 30 March 2021not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral. Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral. He set out a number of reasons behind the decision not to prosecute. Among these, he said was that a ""lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police"" would ""pose an insurmountable difficulty"" if prosecutions were brought. Mrs Foster called for then-Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign as a result, saying his position was now ""untenable"". Mr Byrne said he would not resign and added that no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral. PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne says he will not resign Lockdown regulations stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors. The regulations, as they were in place on the day of the funeral,also stated that people could leave their homes to attend the funeral of a friend,externalif no close family member or member of their household was attending. People were allowed to leave their home to ""visit a burial ground to pay respects to a member of your household or your family member of a friend"". A number of Mr Storey's family attended his funeral. The regulations said if anyone had to leave their home they should maintain a distance of at least 1m from anyone outside their household. An independent investigation was launched into Mr Storey's cremation at Roselawn Cemetery, which is run by Belfast City Council. It had been claimed that some council staff were allowed to go home early, leaving republicans largely in control of what took place. The report, published in February 2021, foundSinn FÃ©in did not pressurise the council to give his family special treatment. It also rejected suggestions there had been a ""takeover"" of Roselawn cemetery. In addition, questions were also raised over why a large crowd gathered at Milltown Cemetery in west Belfast for speeches by Sinn FÃ©in politicians when the cremation happened at Roselawn in east Belfast. Milltown Cemetery is a significant location for republicans, and contains the graves of a number of high-profile republicans, including Bobby Sands. Large crowds are a common feature at funerals of high profile republicans. During the Troubles, tens of thousands of people turned out for the funerals of IRA members who had been killed. Funerals often feature common elements, such as a piper, while the coffin is draped in the Irish flag. According to political commentator Chris Donnelly, these types of funerals ""demonstrate a commitment to pursue the cause"" of Irish unification, as well as allowing mourners to grieve and pay their respects. ""So a funeral almost is an occasion to express gratitude, renew commitment and the passing of the torch all rolled up into one,"" he said.

"Cyber-security companies are warning about the rise of so-called 'extortionware' where hackers embarrass victims into paying a ransom. Experts say the trend towards ransoming sensitive private information could affect companies not just operationally but through reputation damage. It comes as hackers bragged after discovering an IT Director's secret porn collection. The targeted US firm has not publicly acknowledged that it was hacked. In its darknet blog post about the hack last month, the cyber-criminal gang named the IT director whose work computer allegedly contained the files. It also posted a screen grab of the computer's file library which included more than a dozen folders catalogued under the names of porn stars and porn websites. The infamous hacker group wrote: ""Thanks God for [named IT Director]. While he was [masturbating] we downloaded several hundred gigabytes of private information about his company's customers. God bless his hairy palms, Amen!"" The blog post has been deleted in the last couple of weeks, which experts say usually implies that the extortion attempt worked and the hackers have been paid to restore data, and not publish any more details. The company did not respond to requests for comment. The same hacker group is also currently trying to pressure another US utility company into paying a ransom, by posting an employee's username and password for a members-only porn website. Another ransomware group which also has a darknet website shows the use of similar tactics. The relatively new gang has published private emails and pictures, and is calling directly for the mayor of a hacked municipality in the US to negotiate its ransom. In another case, hackers claim to have found an email trail showing evidence of insurance fraud at a Canadian agriculture company. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, says the trend points to an evolution of ransomware hacking. ""This is the new norm. Hackers are now actually searching the data for information that can be weaponised. If they find anything that is incriminating or embarrassing, they'll use it to leverage a larger pay-out. These incidents are no longer simply cyber-attacks about data, they are full-out extortion attempts."" Another example of this was seen in December 2020, when the cosmetic surgery chain The Hospital Group washeld to ransomwith the threat of publication of 'before and after' images of patients. Ransomware has evolved considerably since it first appeared decades ago. Criminals used to operate alone, or in small teams, targeting individual internet users at random by booby-trapping websites and emails. In the last few years, they've become more sophisticated, organised and ambitious. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Criminal gangs are estimated to be making tens of millions of dollars a year, by spending time and resources targeting and attacking large companies or public bodies for huge pay-outs, sometimes totalling millions of dollars. Brett Callow has been following ransomware tactics for years, and says he saw another shift in methods in late 2019. ""It used to be the case that the data was just encrypted to disrupt a company, but then we started seeing it downloaded by the hackers themselves. ""It meant they could charge victims even more because the threat of selling the data on to others was strong."" This latest trend of threatening to publicly damage an organisation or individual has particularly concerned experts because it is hard to defend against. Keeping good backups of company data helps businesses to recover from crippling ransomware attacks, but that is not enough when the hackers use extortionware tactics. This video can not be played Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers Cyber-security consultant Lisa Ventura said: ""Employees should not be storing anything that could harm a firm reputationally on company servers. Training around this should be provided by organisations to all their staff. ""It's a troubling shift in angle for the hackers because ransomware attacks are not only getting more frequent, they are also getting more sophisticated. ""By identifying factors such as reputational damage, it offers far more leverage to extort money from victims."" A lack of victim reporting and a culture of cover-up makes estimating the overall financial cost of ransomware difficult. Experts at Emsisoft estimate that ransomware incidents in 2020 cost as much as $170bn (Â£123bn) in ransom payments, downtime and disruption.

"Consumers have been splashing out ahead of Easter as people prepare for weekend celebrations amid eased lockdown restrictions, research suggests. Easter egg sales have climbed Â£48m, soaring almost 50% to Â£153m compared with last year, according to figures from analysts Kantar. Meanwhile shoppers have already spent Â£37m on hot cross buns. M&S, Asda and Thorntons are among those reporting a big rise in demand. ""There are signs of people making a special, even symbolic, effort this year,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. ""Grandparents might be showing up with additional treats after 12 months of restrictions."" Shoppers rush to buy Easter trees as lockdown eases Retail sales stage partial recovery in February M&S said sales of its enlarged range of online Easter gifts are up 3,000%, while Easter egg sales are up 86%. Meanwhile an Asda spokesman said: ""We've seen many customers choosing to buy their Easter eggs early and buying more than they would normally - the average number of eggs bought ranging between three-five eggs per person. ""As a result, we're predicting sales of over 19 million Easter eggs together with 33 million individual hot cross buns as Brits prepare for what looks to be their biggest Easter yet."" Thorntons said it had seen 200% rise in sales online compared to 2019, before the pandemic began. It said consumers were purchasing ""extra special"" treats for loved ones, such as handcrafted Easter eggs, while ""more people than ever"" are using its icing service to share personal messages on eggs. Sales of hot cross buns are also up According to Kantar's survey, 61% of people are looking forward to socialising with friends again this Easter, and 23% of households are planning to dust off the barbecue over the weekend if the weather allows. Research from Sainsbury's published last week suggested three out of five people plan to host Easter lunch outside, while four out of five said if there was wet weather it would not stop them going ahead with their outdoor plans. Meanwhile more than half of households said they will swap an Easter roast for a less traditional lunch this weekend, to make the most of the rule of six, which allows families and friends to celebrate in their garden. A third are planning barbecues, according to Sainsbury's, while a quarter will order takeaways and a fifth will have picnics. Many are planning barbecues Beyond the Easter boost, grocery sales rose 7.4% in the 12 weeks to 21 March compared with a year earlier, although that was a marked slowdown compared with previous months. In fact sales slipped 3% in the four weeks to 21 March compared with a year earlier. But that marked the first national lockdown when concerned shoppers stripped supermarket shelves bare at the start of the pandemic. ""This time last year, Brits were adjusting to schools and offices closing and making extra trips to the supermarket to fill their cupboards for lockdown,"" pointed out Mr McKevitt. ""To put that into context, shoppers made 117 million fewer trips to the supermarket this month compared with those fraught weeks in March 2020."" He said for the bigger picture it was important to look at the numbers in relation to two-year growth figures. ""While grocery growth has slowed against 2020, sales are still much higher than the same 12 weeks in 2019 - up by 15.6%,"" he said. ""As restrictions on dining out continue, the average household spent an extra Â£134 on take-home groceries compared with this period two years ago."" Iceland saw the strongest growth during the period - excluding online-only Ocado - with a jump in sales of 14.3%. Aldi was the worst performer with growth of just 1.5% in the 12-week period. Tesco increased sales by 8.5% and gained share to capture 27.1% of the market, up by 0.3 percentage points year. Asda inched up its market share from 15.0% to 15.1%. Ocado's sales surge saw its growth climb 33.9%, but online grocery sales slowed in the past four weeks, with signs that shoppers are returning to physical stores. Kantar's figures suggest shoppers made 13 million additional trips to supermarkets this month compared with February. It said confidence had returned particularly among the over-65s, with the age group making 143,000 fewer online orders.

"Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar; the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon; Scottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie; Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross and Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater all feature in Tuesday's broadcast Scotland's political leaders are to face each other in the first TV debate of the Holyrood election campaign. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Tory Douglas Ross, Labour's Anas Sarwar, Green Lorna Slater and Lib Dem Willie Rennie will all take part in the BBC programme. They will seek to set out their key policy pledges and arguments ahead of the Scottish Parliament vote on 6 May. A further debate is to take place towards the end of the campaign. Tuesday's programme will be onBBC One Scotland,starting at 19:50. It will run for an hour and 10 minutes and be moderated by the BBC's Scotland Editor Sarah Smith. It can also be viewed on theBBC's News Channeland theiPlayer. It will be streamed live, with added analysis, on theBBC Scotland news website Nicola Sturgeon-SNP leader- She set out the core principles of the SNP's platform in a campaign conference speech on Monday, saying the poll on 6 May was ""perhaps the most important election in our country's history"". The first minister said she could provide ""strong, experienced leadership that the country needs at this time of crisis"". And she said independence was central to her plans to rebuild Scotland post-pandemic. Douglas Ross-Scottish Conservatives leader- He is putting opposition to independence at the heart of their campaign, saying that a new referendum would jeopardise the recovery from Covid-19. Mr Ross has said his party would set out a ""positive plan for Scotland's recovery"" - including the recruitment of more teachers and investment in infrastructure and economic growth - but said none of it could happen if the country was gripped by a fresh constitutional debate. Anas Sarwar-Scottish Labour leader- Scottish Labour launched its campaign on Monday, with new leader Anas Sarwar saying the next term of parliament should be focused on recovery - with the health services first in line. Mr Sarwar unveiled plans for ""life-saving"" mental health workers in every GP practice in Scotland. Lorna Slater-co-leader of the Scottish Greens- The Scottish Greens are basing their campaign on support for independence and a ""green recovery from the pandemic"". Ms Slater has said the party's manifesto will include plans for Â£7.5bn of investment in public transport, warm homes and renewable energy, creating 100,000 jobs. Willie Rennie-Scottish Liberal Democrat leader-  The Scottish Lib Dems say they would ""put recovery first"", arguing there should not be a fresh referendum ""in the wake of a terrible pandemic"". Mr Rennie said his plans included ""cutting waits for mental health, delivering a bounce back plan for education, more jobs and action on the climate"". The BBC considers a number of factors when deciding who takes part in its TV election debates.  One of those factors is based on previous and current electoral support. For example, the parties featuring in Tuesday's broadcast had MSPs elected to Holyrood in 2016. They also have elected representation in other chambers, such as local councils and at Westminster. Ahead of an election the BBC issues a set of guidelines, which can be foundhere. They are general rules outlining how the broadcaster will cover things like day-to-day campaigning and debates. Although the leaders of smaller parties will not appear in this live television event there will be impartial and proportionate coverage of their campaigns in the coming weeks. Nicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie go into tonight's debate as the most experienced performers. Mr Rennie has fronted Scottish Liberal Democrat campaigns for a decade, while Nicola Sturgeon has been SNP leader since 2014. Their challenge is to appear fresh when they are so familiar. The others are appearing in this format for the first time. Anas Sarwar has only had a month in charge. The Scottish Conservatives appointed Douglas Ross last summer. While both have questioned Nicola Sturgeon at Holyrood, they have not yet been tested against her or each other on live TV. Like the other newcomer - Lorna Slater - they have a big opportunity here to make an impact and energise their campaigns. There is also danger for everyone in the line up. A low key performance or a gaffe could set back their election efforts. SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government.Find out more here. What powers does the Scottish Parliament have?MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Â Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You canÂregister to vote online,external. Questions will come from members of the public who represent a range ofdifferent political opinions and demographics. However, because of Covid-19 restrictions they will attend virtually. The audience is designed to reflect the broad range of political opinions on many of the issues affecting Scotland. That could be based on voting history, views on big issues like independence, as well as diversity of age, gender, social demographics and geographical location.

"David Cameron stepped down as PM after the Brexit referendum in 2016 Labour has called on a standards watchdog to investigate the extent of government access offered to financial services firm Greensill Capital. The party wants the Committee on Standards in Public Life to examine the role played by the firm's founder in David Cameron's coalition government. The Sunday Times claimed Lex Greensill had been given ""privileged access"" to Whitehall departments under the ex-PM. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter. Minister defends Cameron as 'a man of integrity' Labour seeks probe over Cameron Greensill lobbying Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Labour said the reports raised questions about transparency rules. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""no suggestion"" the former prime minister ""could not pursue another career after politics"". He added that he did not think Mr Cameron ""did anything wrong"", but the government was ""always reviewing the rules"" and ""looking at new circumstances... trying to improve the existing rules and improve the system"". In its letter, Labour asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of the firm after he left office. It has previously been reported that Mr Cameron, who became an adviser to Greensill in 2018, unsuccessfully tried to increase the specialist bank's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to companies struggling due to the Covid pandemic. Greensill, which went bust recently, wasaccredited to supply,externallending under the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS). Mr Cameron wascleared this weekby a lobbying watchdog, which looked at whether he should have declared himself on the register of consultant lobbyists over work he had done for the firm since leaving Downing Street. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Greensill's founder, Lex Greensill, was given access to various government departments during Mr Cameron's time in No 10. The newspaper said Mr Greensill had been promoting a financial product for pharmacists. The Pharmacy Early Payment Scheme, announced in 2012, saw banks swiftly reimburse pharmacists for providing NHS prescriptions, for a fee, before recovering the money from the government. Greensill Capital went on to provide funds for the scheme. Labour said the reports raised ""serious questions about the level of extensive access to ministers and departments he was granted and the role Mr Cameron played in securing it"". In a letter to its chair, independent peer Lord Evans, the party said the Committee on Standards in Public Life should ask why Mr Greensill's role promoting the scheme had not been ""announced internally or publicly"". Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, who co-wrote Labour's letter along with shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves, also called on the committee to look into the decision to accredit Greensill to the CLBILS loan scheme. The pair suggested the committee should look at ""whether proper due diligence was undertaken on the firm's financial health by government"". They added that taxpayers ""deserve to know the true extent of access to this current Conservative government that was afforded to Greensill Capital through the former prime minister"". Replying to their letter, Lord Evans said his committee ""is an advisory body and does not have a remit to investigate individual cases"". But he added the committee would welcome suggestions from the party on improving transparency rules as part of an existing inquiry due to report in the autumn. A government spokesman said Mr Greensill had previously acted as a supply-chain finance adviser and crown representative - adding the appointment had been unpaid and was approved in the normal manner.

"Nike is suing Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over a controversial pair of ""Satan Shoes"" that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles. The $1,018 (Â£740) trainers, which feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words ""Luke 10:18"", were made using modified Nike Air Max 97s. MSCHF released 666 pairs of the shoes on Monday in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X and says they sold out in less than a minute. Nike claims trademark infringement. It has asked the court to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh design mark. ""MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,"" the sports shoe giant says in the lawsuit. MSCHF ""dropped"" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday. Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton New shoe tech is 'free time' in races Nike exec quits after son's resale firm revealed The song sees the rapper, who came out in 2019, celebrating his sexuality while rejecting society's attempts to shame him. In the heavily stylised video, he slides down a stripper pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snapping his neck and stealing his horns. The imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - ""So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'."" Each shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. In its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes. Lil Nas X and MSCHF's Satan Shoes sold out in less than a minute on Monday ""There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,"" it said. The lawsuit cites a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US. Some conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter.

Lil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, and on Monday was tweeting several memes on his profile in response to news of the Nike lawsuit. Joseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost. ""I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,"" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement. ""I wanted to support a black gay man who is attempting to show a different narrative in a majority Christian country that currently is dealing with a lot of issues with black people. So what better way to do that than to buy shoes that this person has collaborated with?"" he said. McKenzi Norris criticised Nike's lawsuit Buyer McKenzi Norris of South Carolina, a longtime follower of the MSCHF art collective, said Nike's lawsuit had disrupted his plans to resell the trainers for $2,500 on eBay, which removed his listing.

"Remote workers are invited to live in rural Ireland as part of the five-year plan Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life. The Irish government scheme is part of afive year rural development policy,external, released on Monday. Under the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year. The government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. It will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely. The Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. It is the first European country to come up with such a plan. 'Hybrid working will become the norm' How to be happier while working from home Rural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was ""the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades"". ""As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas."" Concern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse. A previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure. Civil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections. But this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments. And the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite. But to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic. The report commits to ""explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services"". The minister likened it to the UK's ""the hub in the pub"" concept. ""We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,"" she said. ""It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there."" Cork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported. As part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to â¬2.7bn (Â£2.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan. ""There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. ""I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes."" Northern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an""enduring"" remote-working policywith trade unions. In February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers. The Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers ""north and south"" to remote working. However ""restrictive"" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said. ""Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. ""Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based."" The Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.

"Northern Ireland's first mass vaccination centre opened at the SSE Arena on Monday There is a ""background fear"" uptake of a Covid-19 vaccine will reduce as the roll out moves to younger age groups, a leading GP has said. Various factors such as social media and rumours could influence people, according to the chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee. However, Dr Alan Stout said there hadn't been a huge amount of vaccine hesitancy so far in Northern Ireland. ""The numbers have been massively impressive,"" he said. Young men tended to be the hardest group to get ""for any sort of healthcare intervention"", added Dr Stout, with this trend likely to continue when it came to the coronavirus vaccine. Dr Stout also said members of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities in Northern Ireland weren't coming forward for the vaccine ""as much as other communities and parts of the population"". The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends Covid vaccine: Will young people take it? He stressed the need for vaccine uptake among these communities, saying there was ""very strong evidence that they are affected worse with Covid-19"". Dr Stout also addressed concerns around how the vaccine could affect fertility in young women. ""Any information and any background that we have, the words that have been used are 'scientifically implausible' that it could have any impact on fertility,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""The sheer numbers of vaccines that have been given worldwide, we would have already been starting to see some sort of a trend and there is absolutely no evidence of any effect on fertility at all."" Dr Stout said there was ""a need for targeting"" the younger generation with the vaccine rollout. ""It is just so vital that we get everybody vaccinated,"" he said. ""If we have as many people vaccinated as possible, the protection for the whole population is huge, it also stops the virus circulating which stops it then replicating, which massively, massively reduces our risk of the variants - which is what we fear most."" Dr Stout urged the public to ""listen to the professionals"" as opposed to opinions shared on social media. ""We knew at the outset we were going to be fighting a pandemic in the era of social media, it has had an influence and an impact right throughout, and we're now seeing it with the vaccine,"" he said. ""We've given millions of doses worldwide already and it has been tracked closer and better than any vaccine has been tracked before, so we know all the data, we know how safe it is and we know how important and effective it is as well.""

"All eyes are on Minnesota this week as the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin gets underway. Mr Chauvin faces two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in Minneapolis. Protesters crowded the streets in Mr Floyd's name in cities across the US and around the world over the summer. An African-American political hopeful, a Minnesota resident and a retired police veteran shared their thoughts on Day One of the trial. A community activist, an entrepreneur and a father of two, Curtis went viral last year for his impassioned message about the generational injustices African Americans have suffered. He is now running for city council in his hometown of Charlotte. Tell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial. Having to watch the details of what happened, having to watch the video over, having to relive the moment - it was hurtful. I'm still in awe and I can't believe it happened. It pisses me off. We have some of the most horrific mass murderers of our time in custody without a scratch, but this black man who allegedly uses counterfeit $20 bill loses his life and loses it tragically. They've got to convict the [former police officer]. If they don't convict him, it's going to be a problem. All you need to know about Derek Chauvin trial The man accused of killing George Floyd What did you make of the opening arguments from the two legal teams? The prosecution presented very good evidence. He was very detailed and said some things that I think will be really critical to the case. He reminded us of an officer's oath and said, despite all his training, this officer sat on someone's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds. As for the defence, they're trying to make it seem like George Floyd was a drug addict and the opioids took his life. We already knowthey [the county medical examiner's officer] deemed this a homicide.And we know that police officers are supposed to care for who is in their custody and they did not do that. They had no regard for George Floyd's life. Did he need to lose his life? The officer came to a situation where he should have de-escalated and given out a ticket in the worst case scenario. What impact do you think this trial will have? I'm watching the case closely because I want to see what the outcome is going to be. Are we going to hold this officer accountable for his actions? This is a chance for America to show exactly what they represent: giving everybody liberty and justice for all. If you don't convict him of all three charges, you're simply telling black America and minority Americans that we do not care for you. This is a white America and you're going to get down or lay down. Now people are fighting for equality, but soon they'll be fighting for revenge. Melissa is a mixed-race resident of the Minneapolis-St Paul area and a mother of two. With the trial unfolding 'in her backyard', she is keeping a close eye on it and hopes to see some accountability Tell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial. This trial is in our backyard, so I'm cautiously optimistic there will be some justice here. There was rioting in St Paul [last year]. Buildings burned down. Businesses we frequented were permanently closed down. Our neighbourhood Trader Joe's [grocery store] was raided. That was all very concerning, but my current concern is a fair trial. I think there needs to be some level of accountability for Chauvin. I have a lot of respect for the police but I do think some officers - although rare - take advantage of their authority and go too far. What did you make of the opening statements from the two legal teams? The defence is trying to make the case that the officer was just following his training. They are also saying there's no evidence of asphyxiation and that the actual cause of death was related to heart issues and drugs in his system. He had pre-existing conditions that he lived with just fine until he was down on the ground with people on his back and neck for nine minutes, so I'm not sure it was those pre-existing conditions - and not the actions of the officers - that took his life. What impact do you think this trial will have? The United States as a country is much more aware of racial injustice and inequality for people of colour. We're much more ""woke"" than last year. That's been a big change and I think it's a permanent change in our culture. I'm a bit concerned because we've been here before and I don't think things have gotten better in terms of the treatment of African Americans in the judicial system. I don't understand the nuances of the three different charges, but I hope Chauvin is found guilty of something because he needs to be held accountable for what he did. A retired police lieutenant who spent 34 years on the force in two states, Randy trained law enforcement for over three decades and founded The Wounded Blue, a national organisation that assists injured and disabled officers. Tell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial If this was a normal trial - that is, there wasn't so much politics and emotion involved - I'd much rather be sitting at the defence's table than the prosecutor's table. The fact they charged Chauvin with three charges indicates that they are not confident in a conviction. They're throwing it against the wall and hoping that one will succeed in a conviction. The issue is that there are so many sociological factors at play here and, whether or not you can get an entire jury to agree on a conviction is going to be a very large burden for the prosecution. This is a watershed moment for law enforcement because of the actions that took place as a result of the death of George Floyd. We've already seen how this has affected law enforcement in so many ways, from the political environment to the violence towards police. This is a highly charged and emotional case, so that is a huge hurdle for the defence. No use of force looks good. It is always ugly and controversial, but that doesn't mean it's not reasonable. The jurors who will decide Derek Chauvin's fate An athlete, friend and father - who was George Floyd? Should trial of George Floyd officer be televised? What did you make of the opening arguments from the two legal teams? I found the opening arguments very interesting. The prosecution has signalled their strategy very clearly and that is to work on the emotions of the jurors. They did that by the initial playing of the video. Now the prosecution has the heavy burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent involved with his death. The defence was prepared, coherent and easily understandable. There was no flashiness or flamboyance. It was meat and potatoes defence work. This was about explaining to laypeople the very complicated issue of the reasonableness of Chauvin's actions because that is going to be the linchpin of this case. What took place on that day could have happened to any police officer in the country. This all comes down to whether the actions of Chauvin were reasonable. What impact do you think this trial will have? This has already affected law enforcement in ways that will ripple through for decades. The entire parameters of use of force are being re-examined. The pullback of resources. The defunding aspects. The training aspects. There is a crisis in law enforcement and it is barrelling towards us like a freight train. And that is de-policing, a lack of qualified applicants willing to enter the profession and the lack of retention of officers. You're seeing them quit and retire, and there's a huge learning curve in the confidence levels of law enforcement.

"Nike is suing Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over a controversial pair of ""Satan Shoes"" that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles. The $1,018 (Â£740) trainers, which feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words ""Luke 10:18"", were made using modified Nike Air Max 97s. MSCHF released 666 pairs of the shoes on Monday in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X and says they sold out in less than a minute. Nike claims trademark infringement. It has asked the court to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh design mark. ""MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,"" the sports shoe giant says in the lawsuit. MSCHF ""dropped"" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday. Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton New shoe tech is 'free time' in races Nike exec quits after son's resale firm revealed The song sees the rapper, who came out in 2019, celebrating his sexuality while rejecting society's attempts to shame him. In the heavily stylised video, he slides down a stripper pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snapping his neck and stealing his horns. The imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - ""So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'."" Each shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. In its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes. Lil Nas X and MSCHF's Satan Shoes sold out in less than a minute on Monday ""There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,"" it said. The lawsuit cites a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US. Some conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter.

Lil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, and on Monday was tweeting several memes on his profile in response to news of the Nike lawsuit. Joseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost. ""I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,"" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement. ""I wanted to support a black gay man who is attempting to show a different narrative in a majority Christian country that currently is dealing with a lot of issues with black people. So what better way to do that than to buy shoes that this person has collaborated with?"" he said. McKenzi Norris criticised Nike's lawsuit Buyer McKenzi Norris of South Carolina, a longtime follower of the MSCHF art collective, said Nike's lawsuit had disrupted his plans to resell the trainers for $2,500 on eBay, which removed his listing. ""In general I think Nike's lawsuit and their intervention is pretty ridiculous considering how much damage it can cause to everyday people like me who just like to customise and resell their products legally,"" he said.
