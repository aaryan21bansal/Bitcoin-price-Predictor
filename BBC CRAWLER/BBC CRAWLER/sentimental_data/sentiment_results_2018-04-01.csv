"Cierra Brittany Forney with her son Anthony (R), daughter and youngest son What should you do if your child has become a bit, let's say, accustomed to the finer things in life? It's an issue that one mum in Georgia, US, tried to resolve when she realised her 13-year-old son was acting ""a little entitled"". Anthony was ""acting like he's too good to shop at Walmart, or making snarky comments about kids at school who shop at the Goodwill [a second-hand shop]. I don't tolerate that,"" Cierra Brittany Forney, 28, wrote in a Facebook post. She decided to teach him a lesson. ""It's the first time I've ever done anything like this,"" Cierra, an entrepreneur, told the BBC. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

She decided that Anthony should wear second-hand clothes to school for a week and took him to charity shop Goodwill with $20 (Â£14). ""Whatever he found is what he would have to wear. He isn't happy and shed a few tears but I firmly believe in 15 years he will look back and laugh at the day his Mom made him shop at Goodwill. ""I want to teach my kids that money isn't everything and if you have to degrade other people because of where they shop, then you too will shop there. ""We have had multiple discussions about how having nice things is a privilege, not a right, and he can have it all taken away in a second,"" Cierra explained. Anthony is wearing the clothes to school this week.

Your son will look back on this, hopefully valuing the lesson you taught him. Great job, Mama!"" Dawn Kimbley replied. ""I loved your story and if more parents would do this type of lesson to their children this world would be better,"" Soyana Escott wrote. However some people criticised her decision to showcase the lesson on social media. ""I'm concerned that you shamed your child to teach him a lesson in taking him to the store and in sharing his story so publicly,"" commented Jamie Bryant. Others responded that Cierra behaved as though shopping in charity shops is a punishment, pointing out that they routinely buy second-hand clothes for their families. On TuesdayCierra posted a response to some of the criticism,external, clarifying that her son had given permission to share the story. She told the BBC she was shocked that she received death threats from some people, but she also felt overwhelmed by the support many gave her: ""I didn't do this to punish him.

"The Pope greeted crowds after Sunday's Easter address The Pope has called for an end to the ""carnage"" in Syria during his Easter message from the Vatican. He also asked God to heal the wounds in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and urged dialogue on the Korean peninsula. Pope Francis said the power of the Christian message gave hope to the deprived. This included migrants and refugees who he said were ""so often rejected by today's culture of waste"". Thousands of people were in St Peter's Square to hear him speak from the balcony of the basilica. ""Today we implore fruits of peace upon the entire world, beginning with the beloved and long suffering land of Syria whose people are worn down by an apparently endless war,"" said the Pope. Profile: Pope Francis Vatican: Pope did not say there is no hell Pope sorry for upsetting abuse victims ""This Easter may the light of the risen Christ illuminate the consciences of all political and military leaders, so that a swift end may be brought to the carnage in course; that humanitarian law may be respected; and that provisions be made to facilitate access to the aid so urgently needed."" About 80,000 pilgrims listened to his Urbi et Orbi address in St Peter's Square During the first five years of his reign, Pope Francis has been consistently outspoken in condemning the Syrian conflict. In 2013, he was credited with leading moral opposition to Western military intervention, according to BBC Vatican correspondent David Willey. Turning to the wider region, he said on Sunday: ""We beseech fruits of reconciliation for the Holy Land, also experiencing in these days the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenceless, for Yemen and for the entire Middle East, so that dialogue and mutual respect may prevail over division and violence."" In pictures: Christians celebrate Easter The Archbishop of Canterbury also offered a message of peace and hope in his Easter address on Sunday. This video can not be played At an Easter Sunday service the Archbishop of Canterbury stressed the importance of hope. Speaking at Canterbury cathedral, Archbishop Justin Welby stressed the importance of maintaining hope - but he also said the church should admit when it made mistakes: On relations between North and South Korea, the Pope said he hoped talks aiming to ease longstanding tensions on the Korean peninsula would ""advance harmony and peace"". He added: ""May those who are directly responsible act with wisdom and discernment to promote the good of the Korean people and to build relationships of trust within the international community."" The Pope also expressed hope for an end to violence and division in Ukraine and Venezuela. The pontiff was speaking in an ""Urbi et Orbi"" address from the famous central balcony at St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, in front of tens of thousands of the faithful. The Latin phrase means ""to the city [of Rome] and the world"" and the special address is employed only a few occasions - at Christmas, at Easter and just after being elected pontiff.

"Concerns persist over bailiffs using aggressive behaviour to pursue debts despite a legal crackdown, a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) report has found. New laws were introduced in England and Wales in 2014 aimed at protecting people with debts from unfair tactics. But the MoJ review reveals ""lingering concerns"" about the behaviour of a minority of bailiffs. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said aggression would ""not be tolerated"" and called for victims to give evidence. Bailiffs are typically used by creditors, on the authority of the courts, to seize property if people with debts fail to pay what they owe. Ms Frazer said that although the majority of bailiffs act ""professionally and within the rules"", the MoJ had been told by those ""working on the front line"" that intimidation continued in some cases. Concerns over councilsâ use of bailiffs Firm chases wrong couple for Â£4k debt Debt: 'I was up to my neck in it' A call for evidence would be launched ""shortly"" to investigate claims. ""We will identify where the problems are and, if necessary, ensure all bailiffs operate professionally and with proper respect and sensitivity,"" Ms Frazer said. The 2014 reforms included banning bailiffs from entering homes at night, using physical force against people with the debts and preventing them from entering home when only children are present. The laws also stopped bailiffs from taking vital household essentials such as cookers, microwaves, fridges or washing machines. The MoJ review found that since the bailiff reforms progress had been made, including in terms of debtors being aware of their rights. Last year a report called Taking Control, compiled by charities, also claimed that some bailiffs continued toabuse their powersand regularly used intimidation.

"US wine is among the produce affected by China's retaliatory tariffs China has imposed tariffs of up to 25% on 128 US imports, including pork and wine, after US President Donald Trump raised duties on foreign steel and aluminium imports in March. The tariffs affecting some $3bn (Â£2.1bn) of imports kick in on Monday. Beijing said the move was to safeguard China's interests and balance losses caused by new US tariffs. China had previously said it did not want a trade war but would not sit by if its economy was hurt. Mr Trump, however, has insisted that ""trade wars are good"", and that it should be ""easy"" for the US to win one. The American authorities have already announced plans for further targeted tariffs for tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, the BBC's Chris Buckler reports from Washington. They say that is in response to unfair trading practices in China that affect US companies but it raises the possibility of yet more action being taken in what has become a tit-for-tat trade battle, our correspondent adds.

US winemakers feel crushed by China tariffs Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win What could China do in a US trade war? By Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong China's theft of foreign intellectual property is what sparked all this in the first place, according to Washington. If international companies want to operate in China they must hand over their intellectual property for the privilege, thus delivering the likes of German high-speed rail technology into the hands of Chinese engineers. Yet now that China's retaliatory tariffs have kicked in, there are also those sympathetic with that argument who are worried that launching a potential tariff war is not the way to fix the problem. Naturally others say China has been getting away with this for years and tough measures were needed in order to force change. There is also the overall imbalance in US-China trade but a large Chinese surplus, of course, means it is potentially much more exposed during a trade war than America. For this reason Beijing will want to negotiate a way out of this escalating tariff showdown. Its first set of tariffs are relatively mild but they come in response to the first round of US tariffs and a second has already been announced. There are plenty more American companies to be hit and other nations, especially those in Europe and Asia, could soon find themselves dragged into this conflict. US scrap aluminium and frozen pork will be subject to a 25% additional tariff - on top of existing duties. Several other American foods including nuts, fresh and dried fruit, ginseng and wine will be hit by a 15% increase. Rolled steel bars will likewise see a 15% rise in duties. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? China said the new tariffs were a retaliatory measure in light of Mr Trump's decision to raise duties on steel and aluminium imports. But further tax hikes may lie ahead. On 22 March, the US said it was planning to impose duties on up to $60bn  of Chinese importsand limit its investment in the US, in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft. Donald Trump believes tariffs will help cut the US trade deficit with China, which he has vowed to do The White House said it was acting to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy. It remains to be seen if China will follow its opening gambit with stronger measures. In theory, Beijing could tax US tech companies like Apple, for example. Such a move could force US tech giants to raise their prices to compensate. What is a trade war and why should I worry?

"The comedian Eddie Izzard, newly appointed to Labour's ruling body, has said the party must ""stamp out completely the stain of anti-Semitism"". His comments came as Labour distanced itself from a series of controversial pro-Jeremy Corbyn Facebook groups. Areport published in the Sunday Times,externalclaims to have uncovered more than 2,000 anti-Semitic, racist or abusive comments in them. A Labour spokesman said the groups are not connected to the party in any way. Mr Izzard was appointed to Labour's National Executive Committee after the resignation of his predecessor, who had been caught up in the growing anti-Semitism row. ""This is a very important time for the Labour Party and we must stamp out completely the stain of anti-Semitism from a minority of members. It has no place in our party,"" Mr Izzard said. ""We must make amends and repair the damage with the Jewish community as Jeremy Corbyn has promised to do."" The Sunday Times report is the result of a two-month investigation into the 20 biggest pro-Corbyn Facebook groups. Among the messages was praise for Adolf Hitler and threats to kill Prime Minister Theresa May, the paper said. Meanwhile, one of Labour's biggest private donorshas told the Observer he has left the party,externalover its failure to deal with ""the most blatant acts of anti-Semitism"". Sir David Garrard, who has donated Â£1.5 million to Labour since 2003, told the paper: ""I have watched with dismay and foreboding the manner in which the leadership has, in my view, over the last two years, conducted itself."" Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent With negative stories on the front pages of at least four newspapers, this is not a happy Easter Sunday for Labour. The online abuse highlighted by the Sunday Times investigation shows a problem the party has with a relatively small number of people willing to use racism, misogyny and threats of violence in support of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has denounced the behaviour and distanced itself from the groups. Mr Corbyn has condemned, criticised and apologised time and time again. But after a bad week for the party, things have not improved. The leader has admitted that Labour must ""do better"" in tackling anti-Semitism, but with no apparent quick fix at hand and no let-up in accusations, he has some way to go to convince everyone in his party that he has a grip on the problem. The Sunday Times says the Facebook groups covered in its report have a membership of around 400,000 people including 12 senior staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Comments in the groups show members advocating violence, reports the paper. It also said it found messages comparing the Conservatives to Nazis and suggesting a journalist should be killed. Writing in the newspaper, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said she had received an email from someone who claimed to be a party member telling her she should kill herself. She had also been called ""Judas"", ""a venal piece of detritus"", a ""Zionazi"" and an ""absolute parasite."" The organisation Jewish Voice for Labour said the groups highlighted by the Sunday Times did not represent the party. ""We would never tolerate such posts among our members, nor any form of racism or other bigotry,"" a spokesman said. Luciana Berger spoke at a protest against anti-Semitism in the party on Monday A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These groups are not run by the Labour Party or officially connected to the party in any way."" Labour also told the Sunday Times that no-one in Mr Corbyn or Mr McDonnell's offices has seen, posted or endorsed anti-Semitic or abusive messages. The BBC understands that Mr Corbyn has since deleted his personal Facebook account, although his Facebook Page, a separate type of account for public figures and organisations, remains active. It is understood that Mr Corbyn was concerned about being added to groups without his knowledge, and the potential security risk of having a personal account. The latest allegations mark a deepening in the row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party which has dogged Mr Corbyn for the past week. What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue It erupted when Mr Corbyn himself was criticisedfor opposing the removal of an anti-Semitic mural in east London in 2012. On Saturday,senior Labour official Christine Shawcroft resigned from the party's ruling body,the National Executive Committee, and was replaced by Mr Izzard, who had been runner-up when she was elected last year. It had emerged that she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of denying the Holocaust. In a statement Mr Izzard said: ""Although this isn't the manner in which I had hoped to join the NEC I'm honoured to step up and represent Labour members at the heart of our party."" On Friday Mr Corbyn admittedLabour must ""do better""over its handling of anti-Semitism.

"This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' US President Donald Trump has reasserted his opposition to legalising the status of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. He declared on Twitter that Republicans should ""go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws [on illegal migrants] NOW"". Mr Trump also accused Mexico of doing ""very little, if not NOTHING"" to stop migrants flowing into the US. The top candidates for Mexico's presidency have hit out at Mr Trump. On Monday, he again took to Twitter to criticise US border security and immigration laws. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump wanted to scrap the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme from March. But judges halted the move, saying the Obama-era scheme providing protected status to those who entered the US illegally as children must remain in place while legal challenges are heard. The scheme is now closed to new entrants but existing members may renew their benefits while the programme exists. Supreme Court snubs Trump appeal over immigrants What is this immigration debate all about? The approximately 800,000 people protected under Daca are known as ""Dreamers"". Before Easter service on Sunday, Mr Trump told reporters that the Daca programme is being abused But on Twitter, Mr Trump said the programme was being misused by a growing number of illegal migrants and accused Mexico of being lax about border security. He urged Republicans in Congress to pass ""tough"" new anti-immigration legislation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump's Sunday tweets referred to ""caravans"" coming, a possible reference to a travelling group of more than 1,000 migrants which had featured earlier on Sunday on Fox & Friends, known to be one of Mr Trump's favourite TV shows. The mostly Honduran migrants, including whole families, are travelling together through Mexico to try to protect themselves against criminal gangs and harassment. Some say they will claim asylum once they reach the US border. Mr Trump appeared once again to blame current illegal immigration on the Daca programme as he arrived for an Easter church service near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. ""A lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca and we're going to have to really see,"" he told reporters. ""They had a great chance, the Democrats blew it."" In his Sunday tweets and remarks to reporters in Florida, he also threatened to walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico's interior minister said on Monday he had spoken to the US homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and they had agreed to work together to explore how to deal with the flow of migrants. ""We agreed to analyse the best ways to attend to the flows of migrants in accordance with the laws of each country,"" Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete wrote in a post on Twitter. Mr Trump's tweets come amid tense negotiations over Nafta between his administration and that of Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. Mexico goes to the polls on 1 July to elect a new president. Leftist front-runner AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said his country and its people would not be the punch ball (or pinata) of any foreign government. This video can not be played 'America is the only country I've known' The conservative candidate, Ricardo Anaya CortÃ©s, challenged Mr Trump to deal with security issues on his own side of the border. ""We understand that the United States government is worried about undocumented migration to the United States but we are also very concerned about the arms trade from the United States to Mexico,"" he said. Mr Trump's tweets gained a mixed reception on Twitter - including criticism from his former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Governor John Kasich. Allow Twitter content?

In a Sunday tweet, Mr Trump wrote: ""Getting more dangerous. 'Caravans' coming."" The line could be in reference to migrants moving en masse from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala toward the US, organised by volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders). The group counted 1,200 people in the caravan when they set off in late March for the month-long trek - which is more than 2,000 miles (3,220km). About 80% of the migrants are Honduran, fleeing poverty and also unrest in the country after the contentious re-election of President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez last year. Allow Twitter content?

"Two teenagers were stabbed to death in Camden on 20 February A spike in violent crime in London saw more murders committed in the city in February and March than there were in New York, figures show. So far in 2018, the Met Police has investigated 46 murders, compared with 50 in the US city. But, while New York's murder rate decreased from the end of January, London's rose markedly from that point. Ex-Met Police Ch Supt Leroy Logan says it is proof that ""London's violent traits have become a virus"". Statistics from the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Metropolitan Police,reported in the Sunday Times,externaland obtained by the BBC, highlight narrowing murder rates between the two cities, which have similar population sizes. Can Scottish police help stop violent deaths in London? Met Police chief: Social media leads children to violence Nine charts on the rise of knife crime in England and Wales City Hall says it is ""deeply concerned"" by knife crime in the capital, but, along with the Met Police, insists London ""remains one of the safest [cities] in the world"". In January, the Met investigated eight murders whereas the NYPD looked into 18 killings By February, the NYPD's figures had dropped to 11, while London's rose to 15 In March, 22 murders were investigated in London while 21 inquiries were launched in New York When the figures are weighted for population, the rate of murders per 100,000 people was higher in London than in New York in February and March. The Met said it was ""concerned at the increase in murders in London"". ""One murder is one too many, and we are working hard with our partners to understand the increase and what we can all do to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place,"" a spokesman said. However, it is a murder rate that has left Mr Logan feeling ""absolutely devastated"". Former Ch Supt Leroy Logan retired from the Met Police in 2013 after 30 years' service ""I cannot understand how things have gotten out of hand,"" he said. ""We have seen the virus of violence spreading. It is endemic in so many different parts of societies. ""It can only be dealt with in a holistic manner, because it is so holistic in its impact. ""Police can't just arrest or stop and search their way out of this problem; it has to be done in partnership with the communities."" This video can not be played Youth club leader describes an âincreasing level of violenceâ among teenagers. The Met Police has launched 44 murder investigations in 2018, 31 of which have been as a result of stabbings. The deaths of 47-year-oldLaura Cecilia Navarrete De Figueira, from Twickenham, and her sons Claudio, 10, and Joaquin, seven, are part of the same Met Police murder investigation. She was found stabbed in London, while the boys were discovered dead, along with their father, at the foot of Birling Gap, in Sussex. Croydon Central MP Sarah Jones, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime, told theBBC's Today programmethat London could learn from New York in how to reduce violent crime. Sarah Jones says ""London needs to treat violent crime like a disease"" ""New York has been able to bring down serious violence through a public health approach,"" she said. ""We need a proper strategy that looks at all of the issues. ""Knife crime and violent crime acts like an epidemic, so you need to go in at the source to cut it off and then you need to inoculate the future young people against it. ""Going in at source means major intervention work with youth workers, inoculating means going into schools, changing the social norms, educating kids, teaching them what it is to be a man, teaching them how they don't need to carry knives."" The Met has investigated 46 murders in 2018 - of which 31 were stabbings In February, the Met's Commissioner Cressida Dick visited police in Glasgow to learn about apublic health approach which has seen murder rates in Scotland drop dramatically. There are plans for Ms Dick to carry out more ""fact-finding trips"", in New York and with the West Midlands, Durham and Avon & Somerset forces.

"The comedian Eddie Izzard, newly appointed to Labour's ruling body, has said the party must ""stamp out completely the stain of anti-Semitism"". His comments came as Labour distanced itself from a series of controversial pro-Jeremy Corbyn Facebook groups. Areport published in the Sunday Times,externalclaims to have uncovered more than 2,000 anti-Semitic, racist or abusive comments in them. A Labour spokesman said the groups are not connected to the party in any way. Mr Izzard was appointed to Labour's National Executive Committee after the resignation of his predecessor, who had been caught up in the growing anti-Semitism row. ""This is a very important time for the Labour Party and we must stamp out completely the stain of anti-Semitism from a minority of members. It has no place in our party,"" Mr Izzard said. ""We must make amends and repair the damage with the Jewish community as Jeremy Corbyn has promised to do."" The Sunday Times report is the result of a two-month investigation into the 20 biggest pro-Corbyn Facebook groups. Among the messages was praise for Adolf Hitler and threats to kill Prime Minister Theresa May, the paper said. Meanwhile, one of Labour's biggest private donorshas told the Observer he has left the party,externalover its failure to deal with ""the most blatant acts of anti-Semitism"". Sir David Garrard, who has donated Â£1.5 million to Labour since 2003, told the paper: ""I have watched with dismay and foreboding the manner in which the leadership has, in my view, over the last two years, conducted itself."" Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent With negative stories on the front pages of at least four newspapers, this is not a happy Easter Sunday for Labour. The online abuse highlighted by the Sunday Times investigation shows a problem the party has with a relatively small number of people willing to use racism, misogyny and threats of violence in support of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has denounced the behaviour and distanced itself from the groups. Mr Corbyn has condemned, criticised and apologised time and time again. But after a bad week for the party, things have not improved. The leader has admitted that Labour must ""do better"" in tackling anti-Semitism, but with no apparent quick fix at hand and no let-up in accusations, he has some way to go to convince everyone in his party that he has a grip on the problem. The Sunday Times says the Facebook groups covered in its report have a membership of around 400,000 people including 12 senior staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Comments in the groups show members advocating violence, reports the paper. It also said it found messages comparing the Conservatives to Nazis and suggesting a journalist should be killed. Writing in the newspaper, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said she had received an email from someone who claimed to be a party member telling her she should kill herself. She had also been called ""Judas"", ""a venal piece of detritus"", a ""Zionazi"" and an ""absolute parasite."" The organisation Jewish Voice for Labour said the groups highlighted by the Sunday Times did not represent the party. ""We would never tolerate such posts among our members, nor any form of racism or other bigotry,"" a spokesman said. Luciana Berger spoke at a protest against anti-Semitism in the party on Monday A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These groups are not run by the Labour Party or officially connected to the party in any way."" Labour also told the Sunday Times that no-one in Mr Corbyn or Mr McDonnell's offices has seen, posted or endorsed anti-Semitic or abusive messages. The BBC understands that Mr Corbyn has since deleted his personal Facebook account, although his Facebook Page, a separate type of account for public figures and organisations, remains active. It is understood that Mr Corbyn was concerned about being added to groups without his knowledge, and the potential security risk of having a personal account. The latest allegations mark a deepening in the row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party which has dogged Mr Corbyn for the past week. What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue It erupted when Mr Corbyn himself was criticisedfor opposing the removal of an anti-Semitic mural in east London in 2012. On Saturday,senior Labour official Christine Shawcroft resigned from the party's ruling body,the National Executive Committee, and was replaced by Mr Izzard, who had been runner-up when she was elected last year. It had emerged that she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of denying the Holocaust. In a statement Mr Izzard said: ""Although this isn't the manner in which I had hoped to join the NEC I'm honoured to step up and represent Labour members at the heart of our party."" On Friday Mr Corbyn admittedLabour must ""do better""over its handling of anti-Semitism.

"Filling this year's Panini World Cup sticker book costs Â£773.60, twice the cost for Euro 2016, according to maths expert Prof Paul Harper. The pages contain 32 squads of players, plus managers, stadiums and World Cup legends, totalling 682 stickers. A pack of five stickers has risen from 50p to 80p - a 60% increase. If you buy 137 packets and never get the same sticker twice, it will cost Â£109.60, but this is ""extremely unlikely"", says the professor. Prof Harper, from Cardiff University's School of Mathematics, worked out a formula to include the least probable number of duplicate stickers. In the end, he demonstrated that on average you would need to buy 4,832 stickers - or 967 packets - to complete the Italian-made book. One cost-saving measure is swapping stickers between friends, but even with that tactic, filling the album would be expensive. With 10 friends swapping, it could still cost them an average of Â£247 each to complete the album, according to the professor's calculations. 'Plastic attack' packaging protesters hit Tesco 'Youngest councillor' dies suddenly aged 21 Canadian buys lottery ticket on 18th birthday and wins jackpot In a statement, Panini said: ""If you have difficulty swapping, you can send off to Panini for your missing stickers."" ""The theoretical cost calculated by the academics assumes that the collector is in a bubble with no one to swap with or no access to the internet to send off to our missing stickers service."" In 2016, he made the same calculations for the 680-space Euro sticker book. It was Â£374, meaning the cost has more than doubled. While the Euro competition only had 24 squads - fewer than the World Cup - there were only two fewer stickers in the book printed two years ago. ""I can still recall the joy of finally completing my first Panini album as a young boy for the 1982 World Cup in Spain,"" said Prof Harper. ""Filling an album has become progressively more expensive over the years since then, not just because there are typically more teams competing now, but because Panini have become more creative about allocating spaces.""

"A shortage of special needs funding means growing numbers of children are being left without suitable school places, a teachers' leader has warned. National Education Union leader Kevin Courtney said official statistics showed 4,050 special needs pupils were without a place in 2017 in England. He said it was a disgrace that such pupils were at home because councils were being ""starved"" of funds for them. The government said money for schools and special needs had been protected. It was due to rise to its highest ever level of Â£43bn in 2020, with Â£6bn allocated for special educational needs this year, it said. But theDepartment for Education figures,externalshowed the number of pupils with special needs (SEND) without a school place last year had more than doubled from 1,710 in 2016. The warning comes after it emerged scores of local authorities have asked to switch money targeted at their main schools budget to spend on children with special educational needs. Councils are allocated funds for special needs in both mainstream and special schools through their ""high needs"" budgets. They have been complaining of shortfalls in this budget as it has been ""cash flat"" for a number of years (ie, the total does not account for inflation). At the same time, the number of pupils on plans setting out their special needs, EHCPs, has been growing. Pupils on EHCPs have defined special needs for which extra support staff or equipment is required. It could be a result of a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome; the child may have a hearing or visual impairment or a complex combination of diagnosis or disabilities. Harrison Jonsson, left, is now being home schooled by his mother Sandy after he began to struggle at secondary school Sandy Jonsson's son Harrison, 11, suffers from autism and ADHD. He was given an EHCP in 2014 and received good care in primary school, but after moving to a secondary school in Swindon in September 2017, Harrison began to struggle. Ms Jonsson said he has had a nervous breakdown and subsequently developed an eating disorder and depression. As a result, the single mother - who runs a business from home - was forced to home school Harrison until at least September, as there are no other school places available. ""Unless you're significantly disabled or have a tangible form of autism you're thrown to the wolves,"" she said. ""With the EHCP there's a requirement for schools to make reasonable adjustment and none of this happened."" She believes there needs to be greater oversight on how EHCP money is spent by schools, and has campaigned on the issue. According to a survey by the Association of Directors of Children's Services, there was a Â£400m shortfall in high needs funding last year. On top of this, schools have to provide Â£6,000 per year per pupil on an EHCP. Mr Courtney said: ""Children are at home because local authorities don't have enough money to provide suitable education. ""Local authorities are being placed in an impossible position. ""They have a legal duty to plan high quality education for every child with SEND, but cuts have taken away the resources they need to educate children with complex needs."" WW2 shipwreck refloated by Sri Lanka navy The country where the British are blamed for everything The teenager sentenced to 241 years in prison As of this year, councils have to ask the education secretary for permission to do this unless they can get head teachers locally to agree. Official figures obtained by the BBC showed 48 local education authorities - almost a third - asked for permission to switch the money from the dedicated schools grant to their high needs budget. The DfE approved 16 and said no to 12. A further 20 councils withdrew their applications. West Sussex was one of the local authorities which asked to reallocate general schools budget cash to high needs. The DfE agreed to allow the council to take Â£2.2m from its general school funds to boost special educational needs services. Although its funding was boosted by Â£12.8m or 6.5% for the coming year, the number of pupils with special needs plans is likely to increase by 500 - an increase of 10%. The DfE said local authorities had always been able to adapt their funding allocation to meet local needs, as long as they followed a set criteria. ""The number of councils applying to do this has remained stable in recent years,"" it said. ""High needs funding has been protected in real terms over the next two years, and our extra Â£1.3bn investment for schools and high needs means we are giving local authorities more money for every pupil in every school.""

"Joanna Demafelis, a migrant from the Philippines working as a maid in Kuwait, was killed by her employers A Kuwaiti court has sentenced a married couple to death for the killing of a Filipina maid. A Lebanese man and his Syrian wife were convicted in absentia. The body of Joanna Demafelis was dumped in a freezer in their abandoned apartment. It was discovered in February, more than a year after the murder. The death triggered a diplomatic crisis between Kuwait and the Philippines. Outrage in the Philippines led toa ban on Filipinos travelling to work in Kuwait. After Interpol launched an international search,the couple were arrestedin February in Syria. Nader Essam Assaf was handed over to the authorities in his native Lebanon, which is reportedly now considering a Kuwaiti extradition request. His Syrian wife, Mona, is being held in custody in Damascus. Authorities in the Philippines say they facilitated the return of more than 1,000 ""distressed overseas Filipino workers"" in Kuwait after the body was found. Most were household servants. The Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs estimates that some 252,000 of its citizens are living and working in the country. In many Gulf countries,migrant workers obtain visas under a controversial sponsorship system known as ""kafala"".

"Two teenagers were stabbed to death in Camden on 20 February A spike in violent crime in London saw more murders committed in the city in February and March than there were in New York, figures show. So far in 2018, the Met Police has investigated 46 murders, compared with 50 in the US city. But, while New York's murder rate decreased from the end of January, London's rose markedly from that point. Ex-Met Police Ch Supt Leroy Logan says it is proof that ""London's violent traits have become a virus"". Statistics from the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Metropolitan Police,reported in the Sunday Times,externaland obtained by the BBC, highlight narrowing murder rates between the two cities, which have similar population sizes. Can Scottish police help stop violent deaths in London? Met Police chief: Social media leads children to violence Nine charts on the rise of knife crime in England and Wales City Hall says it is ""deeply concerned"" by knife crime in the capital, but, along with the Met Police, insists London ""remains one of the safest [cities] in the world"". In January, the Met investigated eight murders whereas the NYPD looked into 18 killings By February, the NYPD's figures had dropped to 11, while London's rose to 15 In March, 22 murders were investigated in London while 21 inquiries were launched in New York When the figures are weighted for population, the rate of murders per 100,000 people was higher in London than in New York in February and March. The Met said it was ""concerned at the increase in murders in London"". ""One murder is one too many, and we are working hard with our partners to understand the increase and what we can all do to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place,"" a spokesman said. However, it is a murder rate that has left Mr Logan feeling ""absolutely devastated"". Former Ch Supt Leroy Logan retired from the Met Police in 2013 after 30 years' service ""I cannot understand how things have gotten out of hand,"" he said. ""We have seen the virus of violence spreading. It is endemic in so many different parts of societies. ""It can only be dealt with in a holistic manner, because it is so holistic in its impact. ""Police can't just arrest or stop and search their way out of this problem; it has to be done in partnership with the communities."" This video can not be played Youth club leader describes an âincreasing level of violenceâ among teenagers. The Met Police has launched 44 murder investigations in 2018, 31 of which have been as a result of stabbings. The deaths of 47-year-oldLaura Cecilia Navarrete De Figueira, from Twickenham, and her sons Claudio, 10, and Joaquin, seven, are part of the same Met Police murder investigation. She was found stabbed in London, while the boys were discovered dead, along with their father, at the foot of Birling Gap, in Sussex. Croydon Central MP Sarah Jones, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime, told theBBC's Today programmethat London could learn from New York in how to reduce violent crime. Sarah Jones says ""London needs to treat violent crime like a disease"" ""New York has been able to bring down serious violence through a public health approach,"" she said. ""We need a proper strategy that looks at all of the issues. ""Knife crime and violent crime acts like an epidemic, so you need to go in at the source to cut it off and then you need to inoculate the future young people against it. ""Going in at source means major intervention work with youth workers, inoculating means going into schools, changing the social norms, educating kids, teaching them what it is to be a man, teaching them how they don't need to carry knives."" The Met has investigated 46 murders in 2018 - of which 31 were stabbings In February, the Met's Commissioner Cressida Dick visited police in Glasgow to learn about apublic health approach which has seen murder rates in Scotland drop dramatically. There are plans for Ms Dick to carry out more ""fact-finding trips"", in New York and with the West Midlands, Durham and Avon & Somerset forces.

"Red Cross volunteers are providing help and a drop-in centre has been set up for those affected Gas supplies to thousands of residents have remained cut off for a third day in a Yorkshire town. Contractors working on a housing scheme caused damage to the mains pipe in the Silsden area, near Bradford, on Friday, affecting more than 3,000 properties. Engineers restored gas to 600 homes, but it could be another three days until the whole town is reconnected. Northern Gas Networks (NGN) said it was the largest incident it had dealt with. Barratt, the builder responsible for the Belton Road housing development where the contractors were working, has apologised to residents for the inconvenience. Damage was caused to the mains supply by a contractor working on Barratt Homes Saxon Dene development A major community operation has swung into place with Red Cross and community volunteers providing help as well as the council and police. A drop-in centre has been set up at St James' Church hall and hundreds of heaters and other items have been distributed along with food vouchers. Shower facilities were also provided at Keighley Leisure Centre until 16:00 GMT and will be reopened on Monday from 09:00 to 17:00. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played China's space lab Tiangong-1 tracked on radar The estimated window of re-entry for the defunct Chinese space lab Tiangong-1 has narrowed sharply. The timeframe for the fall to Earth is centred on 01:07 Monday GMT (02:07 BST), plus or minus two hours. Experts are tracking the module as it orbits at an ever decreasing altitude. However, they will only be sure of the timing of the final plunge very late in the descent because of the uncertainties over Tiangong's interactions with the high atmosphere. China has lost communication with the module and there is no way to control its downward flight. However, the risk of any parts of Tiangong hitting a populated area is considered very low. ""Given Tiangong-1 has a larger mass and is more robust, as it is pressurised, than many other space objects that return uncontrolled to Earth from space, it is the subject of a number of radar tracking campaigns,"" explained Richard Crowther, the UK Space Agency's chief engineer. ""The majority of the module can be expected to burn up during re-entry heating, with the greatest probability being that any surviving fragments will fall into the sea,"" he told BBC News. Precise knowledge of the re-entry time and location will come late Typically, only in the last hour or so are experts very confident Most of the module's components will burn up in the high atmosphere Its orbital path means any debris is restricted in where it can fall Perhaps 20-40% could survive to the surface - that's 1.5-3.5 tonnes The highest probability is that this material would hit the ocean Any debris path at the surface would be hundreds of km long Tiangong is the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled Launched in 2011 and visited by six Chinese astronauts, the 10m-long, 8.5-tonne Tiangong module should really have been de-orbited in a planned manner. Traditionally, thrusters are fired on large vehicles to drive them towards a remote zone over the Southern Ocean. But this option appears not to be available, especially after the loss of command links in 2016. Tiangong is now brushing through the top of the atmosphere, which is dragging on the spacecraft and causing it to lose altitude rapidly. Big harpoon is 'solution to space junk' Space junk threatens Earth's future The place spacecraft go to die Thirteen space agencies,under the leadership of the European Space Agency,external, have been using radar and optical observations to follow its path around the globe, modelling its behaviour. This collective, known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), has issued regular updates on the descent progress, and Esa itself gave its own final bulletin on Sunday. This forecast was for a four-hour re-entry window centred on 01:07 GMT Monday. This video can not be played Holger Krag: Something of the size of Tiangong comes back ""roughly every three to four years"" ""A confidence of one hour is only reached about four hours beforehand. And one hour still means almost one revolution around the Earth,"" said Holger Krag, the head of Esa's space debris office. ""But that's still good enough to exclude many countries and even some continents."" What can be said with certainty is that nothing will fall outside of 43 degrees from the equator, north or south. This encompasses a region up to the Mediterranean and down to Tasmania, for example. It is governed by the inclination on which Tiangong was launched. China has limited national tracking facilities around the globe and so had no choice but to keep the vessel on a reasonably tight equatorial path. The International Space Station by contrast reaches 52 degrees north and south. Astronaut Wang Yaping memorably gave a lecture to school children from Tiangong-1 The module was launched in 2011 to practise rendezvous and docking Two astronaut crews visited in Shenzhou capsules - in 2012 and 2013 They included China's first female astronauts Liu Yang and Wang Yaping China plans a more permanent space station in the next decade It has developed a heavy-lift rocket, Long March 5, for the purpose Although about 5.2 billion people live within the re-entry zone, most of it is ocean, which explains the high probability that any debris that survives to the surface will hit water. Dr Krag said: ""We know from similar events that on average between 20% and 40% of the initial mass has the chance to survive re-entry heating. ""We could apply this rule of thumb also to Tiangong, I believe, because typically the same amount of heat-resistant material in relative terms is onboard all spacecraft. ""So that would mean between 1.5 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes might be able to survive,"" he told BBC News. The components that most often seem to avoid burning up in the atmosphere are tanks. These objects are interior to the spacecraft and so are protected for much of the descent. But they are also made from steel, titanium or carbon-reinforced plastics and these materials are generally more resistant to high temperatures should they become exposed. Tiangong is certainly on the large size for uncontrolled re-entry objects but it is far from being the biggest, historically. The US space agency's Skylab was almost 80 tonnes in mass when it came back partially uncontrolled in 1979. Parts struck Western Australia but no-one on the ground was injured. Nasa's Columbia shuttle would also have to be classed as an uncontrolled re-entry. Its mass was over 100 tonnes when it made its tragic return from orbit in 2003. Again, no-one on the ground was hit as debris scattered through the US states of Texas and Louisiana. The redoubtable cataloguer of space activity, Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, reckons Tiangong is only the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled.

China is participating in the IADC campaign and is sharing some of its data. The nation has since launched a second lab, Tiangong-2, which continues to be operational. It was visited by a re-fuelling freighter, Tianzhou-1, just last year. The Tiangongs were put up to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities - to be testbeds to rehearse activities ahead of China's more permanent space station. This facility, which is expected to comprise a large core module and two smaller ancillary modules, will be in service early next decade, the Asian nation says. A new rocket, the Long March 5, was recently introduced to perform the heavy lifting that will be required to get the core module in orbit.

"Pope Francis has been an outspoken reformer - but his style has also fomented opposition, within the Vatican and beyond Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was a relative outsider when he was chosen to succeed Benedict XVI in 2013. Pope Francis, as he became, is the first Latin American and the first Jesuit to lead the Roman Catholic Church. His election as the 266th pope surprised analysts who may have been expecting a younger man than the 76 year old. At the time of his election he drew broad support from both Church conservatives and reformers, being seen as orthodox on sexual matters but liberal on social ones. His supporters liked his ""common touch"" and his zealous determination to reform the Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), root out corruption in the Vatican bank and deal with the horrific legacy of child sex abuse within the Church. Four years into his papacy, polls suggest the Pope enjoys high popularity ratings, among Catholics and other faiths. He is followed by more than 15 million people on Twitter. But his willingness to take on issues head-on has also created a growing number of opponents, both within the Vatican and outside. On the morning after his election, the new Pope slipped out of Vatican City in a motorcade of unmarked vehicles to pray in a Roman Basilica, according toBBC Rome correspondent David Willey. On the way back to the Vatican, he insisted on settling his bill at a hotel for clergy in the centre of the Italian capital, immediately stamping his style on the papacy. He abandoned the roomy penthouse apartment used by popes for the past century in favour of a tiny suite in the Vatican guesthouse, and turned his back upon the palatial papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. He has gone on tocall into question free-market economics, saidthe Church should apologise to gay people rather than judge them, andcompared European migrant detention centres with concentration camps, among other things. But observers say it is inaccurate to suggest the Pope is a liberal out and out,external. ""Francis is also clearly 'conservative'"", wrote John Allen Jr, editor of the Roman Catholic-oriented news website Crux, in 2016. He added that he had not yet ""changed a single comma in the catechism, the official compendium of church teaching. He's said no to women priests, no to gay marriage, defined abortion as the 'most horrific' of crimes, defended the heart of the ban on birth control, and on every other contested issue declared himself a loyal 'son of the church'."" Nonetheless, his sharp bringing-to-heel of the Curia and his willingness to soften the Church's stance on such issues as communion after remarriage has cemented an increasingly active resistance to his authority. He has also not flinched at replacing cardinals with whom he doesn't see eye to eye. Who is trolling the Pope? Pope Francis's reforms polarise the Vatican Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born to an Italian immigrant railway worker Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, of Italian descent. According to his official Vatican biography, he was ordained as a Jesuit in 1969, and went on to study in Argentina and Germany. As a young man, he had a lung removed because of an infection. The Society of Jesus is a male order of the Catholic Church, with 19,000 members worldwide It was established in 16th Century Europe as a missionary order, and members swear vows of poverty, chastity and obedience The order became so powerful that it was suppressed at the end of the 18th Century but later restored Jesuits have a reputation as expert communicators He became a bishop in 1992 and Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. At the 2005 conclave, he was seen as a contender for the papacy. As Cardinal Bergoglio, his sermons always had an impact in Argentina and he often stressed social inclusion, indirectly criticising governments that did not pay attention to those on the margins of society. As archbishop of Buenos Aires (here in 2005), Cardinal Bergoglio was known for his humility and common touch Francesca Ambrogetti, who co-authored a biography of him, told Reuters news agency that part of his public appeal lay in his ""sober and austere"" lifestyle. For the Church establishment, it was a novelty to have a Jesuit in charge - members are supposed to avoid ecclesiastical honours and serve the Pope himself. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires Ordained as a Jesuit in 1969 Studied in Argentina, Chile and Germany Became Cardinal of Buenos Aires in 1998 Seen as orthodox on sexual matters but strong on social justice His papacy marks a return to modernising Church forces from the traditionalism of his predecessors Francis: The Pope's calling His views were put to the test in Argentina, the first Latin American country to legalise same-sex marriage and whose president at the time, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, promoted free contraception and artificial insemination. The former cardinal appears to be a strong Argentine patriot, telling Argentine veterans of the Falklands War at a 2016 Mass: ""We come to pray for all who have fallen, sons of the homeland who went out to defend their mother, the homeland, and to reclaim what is theirs."" One subject of controversy is his role under the Argentine military dictatorship of 1976-1983, when he led the country's Jesuits. The Vatican has denied claims that Jorge Mario Bergoglio colluded with the military junta in Argentina in the 1970s He was accused of effectively delivering two fellow priests into the hands of the military authorities in 1976 by declining to publicly endorse their social work in the slums of Buenos Aires, which infuriated the junta at the time, the BBC's Vladimir HernÃ¡ndez reported. Another accusation levelled against him from the ""Dirty War"" era is that he failed to follow up a request to help find the baby of a woman kidnapped when five months' pregnant and killed in 1977. It is believed the baby was illegally adopted. The Vatican strenuously denies Pope Francis was guilty of any wrongdoing under the Junta. It emerged that in 2011 he took initial steps towards beatifying Argentine priests murdered under military rule. In a separate case, he also put forward for sainthood five Catholic churchmen who were killed at the St Patrick church in Buenos Aires, also in 1976. And at the Pope's request,the Vatican opened up its files on the Argentine dictatorship, to victims and their relatives. Adolfo PÃ©rez Esquivel, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights activist, who was jailed and tortured by the regime, told BBC News: ""There were some bishops who were in collusion with the military, but Bergoglio is not one of them."" Now that Pope Francis is in his 80s, and with his predecessor having established that popes do not have to remain in their role until death, the question arises whether he might himself decide to resign. He has said ""I would do the same!"", if his powers wane. Pope hints at ordination of married men Who is trolling the Pope?

However, they will only be sure of the timing of the final plunge very late in the descent because of the uncertainties over Tiangong's interactions with the high atmosphere. China has lost communication with the module and there is no way to control its downward flight. However, the risk of any parts of Tiangong hitting a populated area is considered very low. ""Given Tiangong-1 has a larger mass and is more robust, as it is pressurised, than many other space objects that return uncontrolled to Earth from space, it is the subject of a number of radar tracking campaigns,"" explained Richard Crowther, the UK Space Agency's chief engineer. ""The majority of the module can be expected to burn up during re-entry heating, with the greatest probability being that any surviving fragments will fall into the sea,"" he told BBC News. Precise knowledge of the re-entry time and location will come late Typically, only in the last hour or so are experts very confident Most of the module's components will burn up in the high atmosphere Its orbital path means any debris is restricted in where it can fall Perhaps 20-40% could survive to the surface - that's 1.5-3.5 tonnes The highest probability is that this material would hit the ocean Any debris path at the surface would be hundreds of km long Tiangong is the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled Launched in 2011 and visited by six Chinese astronauts, the 10m-long, 8.5-tonne Tiangong module should really have been de-orbited in a planned manner. Traditionally, thrusters are fired on large vehicles to drive them towards a remote zone over the Southern Ocean. But this option appears not to be available, especially after the loss of command links in 2016. Tiangong is now brushing through the top of the atmosphere, which is dragging on the spacecraft and causing it to lose altitude rapidly. Big harpoon is 'solution to space junk' Space junk threatens Earth's future The place spacecraft go to die Thirteen space agencies,under the leadership of the European Space Agency,external, have been using radar and optical observations to follow its path around the globe, modelling its behaviour. This collective, known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), has issued regular updates on the descent progress, and Esa itself gave its own final bulletin on Sunday. This forecast was for a four-hour re-entry window centred on 01:07 GMT Monday. This video can not be played Holger Krag: Something of the size of Tiangong comes back ""roughly every three to four years"" ""A confidence of one hour is only reached about four hours beforehand. And one hour still means almost one revolution around the Earth,"" said Holger Krag, the head of Esa's space debris office. ""But that's still good enough to exclude many countries and even some continents."" What can be said with certainty is that nothing will fall outside of 43 degrees from the equator, north or south. This encompasses a region up to the Mediterranean and down to Tasmania, for example. It is governed by the inclination on which Tiangong was launched. China has limited national tracking facilities around the globe and so had no choice but to keep the vessel on a reasonably tight equatorial path. The International Space Station by contrast reaches 52 degrees north and south. Astronaut Wang Yaping memorably gave a lecture to school children from Tiangong-1 The module was launched in 2011 to practise rendezvous and docking Two astronaut crews visited in Shenzhou capsules - in 2012 and 2013 They included China's first female astronauts Liu Yang and Wang Yaping China plans a more permanent space station in the next decade It has developed a heavy-lift rocket, Long March 5, for the purpose Although about 5.2 billion people live within the re-entry zone, most of it is ocean, which explains the high probability that any debris that survives to the surface will hit water. Dr Krag said: ""We know from similar events that on average between 20% and 40% of the initial mass has the chance to survive re-entry heating. ""We could apply this rule of thumb also to Tiangong, I believe, because typically the same amount of heat-resistant material in relative terms is onboard all spacecraft. ""So that would mean between 1.5 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes might be able to survive,"" he told BBC News. The components that most often seem to avoid burning up in the atmosphere are tanks. These objects are interior to the spacecraft and so are protected for much of the descent. But they are also made from steel, titanium or carbon-reinforced plastics and these materials are generally more resistant to high temperatures should they become exposed. Tiangong is certainly on the large size for uncontrolled re-entry objects but it is far from being the biggest, historically. The US space agency's Skylab was almost 80 tonnes in mass when it came back partially uncontrolled in 1979. Parts struck Western Australia but no-one on the ground was injured. Nasa's Columbia shuttle would also have to be classed as an uncontrolled re-entry. Its mass was over 100 tonnes when it made its tragic return from orbit in 2003. Again, no-one on the ground was hit as debris scattered through the US states of Texas and Louisiana. The redoubtable cataloguer of space activity, Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, reckons Tiangong is only the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled.

China is participating in the IADC campaign and is sharing some of its data. The nation has since launched a second lab, Tiangong-2, which continues to be operational. It was visited by a re-fuelling freighter, Tianzhou-1, just last year. The Tiangongs were put up to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities - to be testbeds to rehearse activities ahead of China's more permanent space station. This facility, which is expected to comprise a large core module and two smaller ancillary modules, will be in service early next decade, the Asian nation says. A new rocket, the Long March 5, was recently introduced to perform the heavy lifting that will be required to get the core module in orbit.

"This video can not be played North Korean leader Kim Jong-un clapped along, like many others at the concert North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his wife have watched South Korean K-pop stars perform in a rare event in Pyongyang. Mr Kim clapped along and then met performers backstage where he conversed and took pictures, said reports. It is the first musical delegation to visit in more than a decade as the leaders of the two countries on the divided peninsula prepare to meet. More than 11 acts are in Pyongyang for two shows. The North sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. The exchanges come amid thawing relations between the Koreas after months of tension. The concert, titled Spring is Coming, took place on Sunday evening local time at the 1,500-seat East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, said South Korean media. The delegation, which combines K-pop, rock and other genres, is set to perform again on Tuesday. Koreas set date for leaders' face-to-face North Korea crisis in 300 words Are North and South Korea friends again? Mr Kim is the first North Korean leader ever to attend a performance by an artistic group from the South, said South Korea's official news agency, Yonhap. The South Korean musicians rehearse before the performance His sister Kim Yo-jong and the country's nominal head of state Kim Yong-nam are also said to have attended. Kim Jong-un ""showed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics"", the South's culture minister Do Jong-hwan told journalists, according to Reuters news agency. Earlier, a North Korean audience also watched a South Korean taekwondo squad perform, this time without Mr Kim. Mr Kim has agreed to hold summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week during his first overseas trip. The third inter-Korean summit - there were also meetings in 2000 and 2007 - is due to be held on 27 April. No date has been set for the US-North Korean summit. This video can not be played There are high-flying kicks galore as South Korean taekwondo athletes perform in Pyongyang before the music concert Meanwhile, the US and South Korea have begun their annual military drills, which have been scaled down compared with previous years as both countries prepare for talks with North Korea. Although nearly 300,000 South Korean troops and 24,000 American troops will take part, the drill will be a month shorter than usual and will not involve nuclear submarines. In the past, the drills have infuriated North Korea but correspondents say that this time Pyongyang is keeping relatively quiet. Mr Kim reportedly told visiting South Korean officials that he understood that the exercises had to go ahead. The musicians performing in Pyongyang include: A five-member girl group, Red Velvet headlined at the Pyeongchang Games this year. The popular quintet who first formed in 2014 are still seen as relative newcomers, but have already managed to scoop up their fair share of awards. They have also got a large following on social media, with some 4.5 million followers on Instagram alone.

The group shot to stardom in 2009, making Seohyun one of today's most recognisable K-pop singers. In February, the 26-year old performed alongside North Korea's 137-strong Samjiyon Orchestra, which was part of North Korea's art troupe during the recent Winter Games. The 61-year-old singer's 1984 song Love Maze,externalwas said to have been a hit across the Korean peninsula and can still be heard playing in Pyongyang restaurants. It is also said to have been a favourite of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. This is Mrs Choi's fourth time performing in the North. An industry veteran, Cho is considered one of the most influential figures in South Korea's music scene. Cho Yong-pil (r) arrives in Pyongyang In an interview with Billboard in 2013, the 68-year-old singer was dubbed a ""K-pop legend"". This is not his first performance in North Korea. Mr Cho made his first debut in Pyongyang in 2005, where he held a solo concert attended by some 7,000 North Koreans - making him the most recent South Korean singer to perform in the North. Another iconic singer in South Korea, Lee Sun-hee first made her debut in 1984.

"Rostov-on-Don is one of the Russian cities hosting the Cup Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has accused the UK and US of seeking to stop her country hosting this summer's World Cup. Speaking in a lengthy interview with a Russian TV channel, she said their ""main aim"" was to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"". The UK has been seeking to punish Russia after accusing it of mounting a nerve agent attack in Britain. The Royal Family will shun the World Cup as part of the British response. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has likened Russia's World Cup to Nazi Germany's Olympic Games in 1936.and oneBritish Opposition MP has called for the Cup to be postponed or moved. However, there is currently no suggestion the England team will boycott the prestigious championship, which opens in June.

In the latest move, about 170 Russian diplomats and their family members left Washington on Friday evening. At the same time, the US flag at the American consulate in St Petersburg was taken down following the Russian government's instruction to close it down. Aeroflot plane in deepening Russia-UK row Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War? Speaking to Russia's Channel 5 TV, Ms Zakharova said: ""It's my impression that all they care about is  taking the World Cup out of Russia. ""They will use any means. Their minds are only on that football and God forbid it should touch a Russian football field."" Russia denies any involvement in the poisoning of the Skripals. Mr Skripal remains critically ill but stable, while his daughter is now said to be conscious and talking. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it will consider a request for Russian consular access to Yulia, a Russian citizen. The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month. The UK is adamant Russia is behind the poisoning of the Skripals. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". Russia says it is seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"" about the poisoning.

"Red Cross volunteers are providing help and a drop-in centre has been set up for those affected Gas supplies to thousands of residents have remained cut off for a third day in a Yorkshire town. Contractors working on a housing scheme caused damage to the mains pipe in the Silsden area, near Bradford, on Friday, affecting more than 3,000 properties. Engineers restored gas to 600 homes, but it could be another three days until the whole town is reconnected. Northern Gas Networks (NGN) said it was the largest incident it had dealt with. Barratt, the builder responsible for the Belton Road housing development where the contractors were working, has apologised to residents for the inconvenience. Damage was caused to the mains supply by a contractor working on Barratt Homes Saxon Dene development A major community operation has swung into place with Red Cross and community volunteers providing help as well as the council and police. A drop-in centre has been set up at St James' Church hall and hundreds of heaters and other items have been distributed along with food vouchers. Shower facilities were also provided at Keighley Leisure Centre until 16:00 GMT and will be reopened on Monday from 09:00 to 17:00. Allow Twitter content?

"Roisin Walker has made dramatic progress in her first week of treatment A 14-year-old girl whose neck was broken in ahit-and-runhas taken her first steps in hospital. Roisin Walker was one of five children struck by a car as they stood on a pavement in Castlemilk, Glasgow. A 21-year-old man who is thought to have been the intended target of the attack was also hit. Roisin's sister Jamieleigh told BBC Scotland her sister is recovering well and has been on her feet for the first time since she was injured. She is being treated at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Children. The incident took place on Stravanan Road at about 15:30 on Saturday 24 March. Police are treating the crime as attempted murder and are keen to trace the driver of the silver Vauxhall Astra involved. The car was later found burnt out about a mile away in Carmunnock. Everyone else struck by the car was treated for minor injuries. Police continue to look for the driver ot the car involved Police confirmed a 21-year-old man had been passing the group of children as he crossed the Stravanan Road at about 15:30 on Saturday.

"Labour has sought to distance itself from a series of pro-Jeremy Corbyn Facebook groups that feature anti-Semitic, racist and abusive comments. Areport published in the Sunday Times,externalclaims to have uncovered more than 2,000 such messages. A Labour spokesman said the groups are not connected to the party in any way. Newly appointed member of Labour's ruling body, comedian Eddie Izzard, said the party must ""stamp out completely the stain of anti-Semitism"". The report is the result of a two-month investigation by the Sunday Times into the 20 biggest pro-Corbyn Facebook groups. Among the messages was praise for Adolf Hitler and threats to kill Prime Minister Theresa May, the paper said. Meanwhile, one of Labour's biggest private donorshas told the Observer he has left the party,externalover its failure to deal with ""the most blatant acts of anti-Semitism"". Sir David Garrard, who has donated Â£1.5 million to Labour since 2003, told the paper: ""I have watched with dismay and foreboding the manner in which the leadership has, in my view, over the last two years, conducted itself."" Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent With negative stories on the front pages of at least four newspapers, this is not a happy Easter Sunday for Labour. The online abuse highlighted by the Sunday Times investigation shows a problem the party has with a relatively small number of people willing to use racism, misogyny and threats of violence in support of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has denounced the behaviour and distanced itself from the groups. Mr Corbyn has condemned, criticised and apologised time and time again. But after a bad week for the party, things have not improved. The leader has admitted that Labour must ""do better"" in tackling anti-Semitism, but with no apparent quick fix at hand and no let-up in accusations, he has some way to go to convince everyone in his party that he has a grip on the problem. The Sunday Times says the Facebook groups covered in its report have a membership of around 400,000 people including 12 senior staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Comments in the groups show members advocating violence, reports the paper. It also said it found messages comparing the Conservatives to Nazis and suggesting a journalist should be killed. Writing in the newspaper, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said she had received an email from someone who claimed to be a party member telling her she should kill herself. She had also been called ""Judas"", ""a venal piece of detritus"", a ""Zionazi"" and an ""absolute parasite."" Luciana Berger spoke at a protest against anti-Semitism in the party on Monday A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These groups are not run by the Labour Party or officially connected to the party in any way."" Labour also told the Sunday Times that no-one in Mr Corbyn or Mr McDonnell's offices has seen, posted or endorsed anti-Semitic or abusive messages. The BBC understands that Mr Corbyn has since deleted his personal Facebook account, although his Facebook Page, a separate type of account for public figures and organisations, remains active. The latest allegations mark a deepening in the row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party which has dogged Mr Corbyn for the past week. What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue It erupted when Mr Corbyn himself was criticisedfor opposing the removal of an anti-Semitic mural in east London in 2012. On Saturday,senior Labour official Christine Shawcroft resigned from the party's ruling body,the National Executive Committee, and was replaced by comedian Eddie Izzard. It had emerged that she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of denying the Holocaust. In a statement Mr Izzard said: ""Although this isn't the manner in which I had hoped to join the NEC I'm honoured to step up and represent Labour members at the heart of our party."" Concerning the anti-Semitism row he said Labour ""must make amends and repair the damage with the Jewish community as Jeremy Corbyn has promised to do."" On Friday Mr Corbyn admittedLabour must ""do better""over its handling of anti-Semitism.

"Philippa Craddock, a self-taught London-based florist, will create the wedding floral displays Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves for their wedding day. London-based florist Philippa Craddock will create the floral displays for St George's Chapel and St George's Hall on 19 May, Kensington Palace said. Locally sourced foliage will be used, including from the gardens of the Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park. Ms Markle said on her now-deleted Instagram account that peonies make her ""endlessly happy"". Soon after the couple started dating, Ms Markle posted a picture of a bouquet of pink and white peonies on Instagram. She captioned the picture: ""Swooning over these. #London #peonies #spoiledrotten"". Ms Markle has previously said that peonies make her ""endlessly happy"" In 2016, the American star posted a bouquet on Instagram, saying: ""I bought these peonies for myself yesterday because they make me so endlessly happy. ""Do something sweet for yourself today too. #treatyourself #simplepleasures #favoriteflowers."" Ms Markle revealed in 2014 that her mother, Doria, had always called her ""Flower"", adding that it was her nickname ""since I was a little girl"". Royal wedding: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's plans Which celebs might by at the royal wedding? Harry and Meghan choose wedding cake Will you be celebrating the royal wedding? Ms Craddock, a self-taught florist, will direct a team from St George's Chapel and Buckingham Palace to create the displays. They will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May where possible, including branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, as well as white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves. Kensington Palace said the designs will reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be drawn. The couple's lemon and elderflower wedding cake will also be decorated with fresh spring blooms. Foxgloves will be featured in the wedding flowers on 19 May Ms Craddock, who has a studio in Fulham and a flower shop in Selfridges, said she was ""honoured and excited"" to have been chosen. ""Working with them has been an absolute pleasure,"" she said. ""The process has been highly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun. ""The final designs will represent them as a couple, which I always aim to achieve in my work, with local sourcing, seasonality and sustainability being at the forefront."" Ms Craddock, who started her business nine years ago, has worked for the V&A, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior and British Vogue. The Royal Parks will also supply some pollinator-friendly plants from their wildflower meadows, which will provide a good habitat for bees, Kensington Palace said. After the wedding, the couple have arranged for the flowers to be distributed to charitable organisations. When Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the bridal bouquet featured white orchids When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011, an ""avenue of trees"" up to 25ft lined the aisle of Westminster Abbey. Almost 30,000 flowers were used, with most taken from Windsor Great Park's Valley Gardens in Surrey, including azaleas and blossoms. Wedding florists said the choice of white, green and cream foliage reflected the bride's English country style. The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer had white hydrangeas, lilies and campanulas at their wedding in St Paul's Cathedral. And when Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the bridal bouquet featured white orchids and also included a sprig of myrtle, a tradition that was started by Queen Victoria. There were also white lilies and chrysanthemums, pink carnations, roses, variegated ivy and camellia foliage in larges vases either side of the altar in Westminster Abbey.

"Some councils in England have already agreed increased fines for littering People dropping litter, including from vehicles, face increased on-the-spot fines of up to Â£150 as new penalties come into effect. Councils across England are being given the power to raise fines from the previous ceiling of Â£80. Authorities can also use the penalties to target vehicles owners if it is possible to prove rubbish has been thrown from their car. The government claims collecting litter costs councils Â£680m a year. Councils are free to set the level of on-the-spot fines up to Â£150 per incident, but minsters have warned the new powers should not be abused. The government said local authorities should take into account factors such as local abilities to pay, when setting a levy. Environment Minister Therese Coffey said: ""These new fines will tackle anti-social behaviour by hitting litter louts in the pocket, whether it's litter that is thrown from a vehicle or dropped in the street. ""Littering is a scourge on our environment and we waste taxpayers' money cleaning it up - funds which could be better spent in the community. ""We want to be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we found it, and I encourage everyone to take responsibility for their litter and recycle more."" The Local Government Association's (LGA) environment spokesman, Martin Tett, said: ""Councils being able to issue increased fines to litter louts, who show no consideration for the community they live in, will send a strong message to those who think their laziness is more important than the environment in which they live. ""Allowing councils to fine the owners of vehicles which litter is thrown from, rather than expecting councils to prove who exactly in the vehicle had thrown litter, is also something that the LGA has long called for."" Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, said: ""There is no excuse for car litter louts. ""Tossing rubbish from vehicles spoils the environment, costs millions and puts road workers' lives at risk when they have to clear up. ""The majority of our members support higher fines for littering and we welcome these steps to tackle this unnecessary problem. ""It is not difficult for car occupants to bag it and bin it.""

"This video can not be played North Korean leader Kim Jong-un clapped along, like many others at the concert North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his wife have watched South Korean K-pop stars perform in a rare event in Pyongyang. Mr Kim clapped along and then met performers backstage where he conversed and took pictures, said reports. It is the first musical delegation to visit in more than a decade as the leaders of the two countries on the divided peninsula prepare to meet. More than 11 acts are in Pyongyang for two shows. The North sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. The exchanges come amid thawing relations between the Koreas after months of tension. The concert, titled Spring is Coming, took place on Sunday evening local time at the 1,500-seat East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, said South Korean media. The delegation, which combines K-pop, rock and other genres, is set to perform again on Tuesday. Koreas set date for leaders' face-to-face North Korea crisis in 300 words Are North and South Korea friends again? Mr Kim is the first North Korean leader ever to attend a performance by an artistic group from the South, said South Korea's official news agency, Yonhap. The South Korean musicians rehearse before the performance His sister Kim Yo-jong and the country's nominal head of state Kim Yong-nam are also said to have attended. Kim Jong-un ""showed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics"", the South's culture minister Do Jong-hwan told journalists, according to Reuters news agency. Earlier, a North Korean audience also watched a South Korean taekwondo squad perform, this time without Mr Kim. Mr Kim has agreed to hold summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week during his first overseas trip. The third inter-Korean summit - there were also meetings in 2000 and 2007 - is due to be held on 27 April. No date has been set for the US-North Korean summit. This video can not be played There are high-flying kicks galore as South Korean taekwondo athletes perform in Pyongyang before the music concert Meanwhile, the US and South Korea have begun their annual military drills, which have been scaled down compared with previous years as both countries prepare for talks with North Korea. Although nearly 300,000 South Korean troops and 24,000 American troops will take part, the drill will be a month shorter than usual and will not involve nuclear submarines. In the past, the drills have infuriated North Korea but correspondents say that this time Pyongyang is keeping relatively quiet. Mr Kim reportedly told visiting South Korean officials that he understood that the exercises had to go ahead. The musicians performing in Pyongyang include: A five-member girl group, Red Velvet headlined at the Pyeongchang Games this year. The popular quintet who first formed in 2014 are still seen as relative newcomers, but have already managed to scoop up their fair share of awards. They have also got a large following on social media, with some 4.5 million followers on Instagram alone. This video can not be played Rock band YB will also be performing in North Korea A member of undoubtedly one of Korea's most famous K-pop groups, Seohyun made her music debut in 2007 as a member of the all-female Girls' Generation. The group shot to stardom in 2009, making Seohyun one of today's most recognisable K-pop singers. In February, the 26-year old performed alongside North Korea's 137-strong Samjiyon Orchestra, which was part of North Korea's art troupe during the recent Winter Games. The 61-year-old singer's 1984 song Love Maze,externalwas said to have been a hit across the Korean peninsula and can still be heard playing in Pyongyang restaurants. It is also said to have been a favourite of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. This is Mrs Choi's fourth time performing in the North. An industry veteran, Cho is considered one of the most influential figures in South Korea's music scene. Cho Yong-pil (r) arrives in Pyongyang In an interview with Billboard in 2013, the 68-year-old singer was dubbed a ""K-pop legend"". This is not his first performance in North Korea. Mr Cho made his first debut in Pyongyang in 2005, where he held a solo concert attended by some 7,000 North Koreans - making him the most recent South Korean singer to perform in the North. Another iconic singer in South Korea, Lee Sun-hee first made her debut in 1984. The now 53-year-old travelled to the North for a joint concert in 2003, which marked the opening of the Ryugyong Chung Ju-yung Gymnasium - one of the performance venues for the upcoming concert.

The row erupted after it emergedshe had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Ms Shawcroft will be replaced on the NEC by comedian Eddie Izzard. Dozens of Labour MPs and peers had urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend Ms Shawcroftfrom the NEC. In a statement announcing her resignation on Saturday night, she said: ""I reaffirm my complete opposition to anti-Semitism and my abhorrence of Holocaust denial, and support all measures to tackle this within the party."" She added that she would ""pledge my full energy to securing for our country the Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn that it so desperately needs."" How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded On Thursday, Ms Shawcroft - who is a director of the Corbyn-backing campaign group Momentum - resigned from another position as chair of Labour's disputes panel. The furore over her defence of Alan Bull, who was standing in Peterborough in May's local elections, comes amid a wider row in which Mr Corbyn has been accused of failing to tackle anti-Semitism within his party - particularly within its left flank. Mr Corbyn himself was criticised last weekfor opposing the removal of an anti-Semitic muralin east London in 2012. Christine Shawcroft is one of the most influential people in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour movement that - until this week at least - you had probably never heard of. Her CV read like this: a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, the head of Labour's disputes committee, and the occupier of a chair on the party's ruling National Executive Committee. It's not quite so wordy any more. Two of those three jobs have gone. In the last few days, she has become the focus of the noisy, bitter and very public row within the party about anti-Semitism. I'm told that given her position on the NEC was elected, rather than appointed, it was her decision to stand down, but Jeremy Corbyn had spoken to her and supported her decision to go. Izzard has campaigned for a seat on the NEC twice, most recently in 2017. As he came second behind Ms Shawcroft in that election, he now assumes her position until a new vote in the summer. He had previously said he wanted to stand for the executive to ""break down barriers"" and make the party more welcoming to groups who feel ""isolated or excluded"".

"Philippa Craddock, a self-taught London-based florist, will create the wedding floral displays Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves for their wedding day. London-based florist Philippa Craddock will create the floral displays for St George's Chapel and St George's Hall on 19 May, Kensington Palace said. Locally sourced foliage will be used, including from the gardens of the Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park. Ms Markle said on her now-deleted Instagram account that peonies make her ""endlessly happy"". Soon after the couple started dating, Ms Markle posted a picture of a bouquet of pink and white peonies on Instagram. She captioned the picture: ""Swooning over these. #London #peonies #spoiledrotten"". Ms Markle has previously said that peonies make her ""endlessly happy"" In 2016, the American star posted a bouquet on Instagram, saying: ""I bought these peonies for myself yesterday because they make me so endlessly happy. ""Do something sweet for yourself today too. #treatyourself #simplepleasures #favoriteflowers."" Ms Markle revealed in 2014 that her mother, Doria, had always called her ""Flower"", adding that it was her nickname ""since I was a little girl"". Royal wedding: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's plans Which celebs might by at the royal wedding? Harry and Meghan choose wedding cake Will you be celebrating the royal wedding? Ms Craddock, a self-taught florist, will direct a team from St George's Chapel and Buckingham Palace to create the displays. They will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May where possible, including branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, as well as white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves. Kensington Palace said the designs will reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be drawn. The couple's lemon and elderflower wedding cake will also be decorated with fresh spring blooms. Foxgloves will be featured in the wedding flowers on 19 May Ms Craddock, who has a studio in Fulham and a flower shop in Selfridges, said she was ""honoured and excited"" to have been chosen. ""Working with them has been an absolute pleasure,"" she said. ""The process has been highly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun. ""The final designs will represent them as a couple, which I always aim to achieve in my work, with local sourcing, seasonality and sustainability being at the forefront."" Ms Craddock, who started her business nine years ago, has worked for the V&A, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior and British Vogue. The Royal Parks will also supply some pollinator-friendly plants from their wildflower meadows, which will provide a good habitat for bees, Kensington Palace said. After the wedding, the couple have arranged for the flowers to be distributed to charitable organisations. When Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the bridal bouquet featured white orchids When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011, an ""avenue of trees"" up to 25ft lined the aisle of Westminster Abbey. Almost 30,000 flowers were used, with most taken from Windsor Great Park's Valley Gardens in Surrey, including azaleas and blossoms. Wedding florists said the choice of white, green and cream foliage reflected the bride's English country style. The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer had white hydrangeas, lilies and campanulas at their wedding in St Paul's Cathedral. And when Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the bridal bouquet featured white orchids and also included a sprig of myrtle, a tradition that was started by Queen Victoria. There were also white lilies and chrysanthemums, pink carnations, roses, variegated ivy and camellia foliage in larges vases either side of the altar in Westminster Abbey.

"Some councils in England have already agreed increased fines for littering People dropping litter, including from vehicles, face increased on-the-spot fines of up to Â£150 as new penalties come into effect. Councils across England are being given the power to raise fines from the previous ceiling of Â£80. Authorities can also use the penalties to target vehicles owners if it is possible to prove rubbish has been thrown from their car. The government claims collecting litter costs councils Â£680m a year. Councils are free to set the level of on-the-spot fines up to Â£150 per incident, but minsters have warned the new powers should not be abused. The government said local authorities should take into account factors such as local abilities to pay, when setting a levy. Environment Minister Therese Coffey said: ""These new fines will tackle anti-social behaviour by hitting litter louts in the pocket, whether it's litter that is thrown from a vehicle or dropped in the street. ""Littering is a scourge on our environment and we waste taxpayers' money cleaning it up - funds which could be better spent in the community. ""We want to be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we found it, and I encourage everyone to take responsibility for their litter and recycle more."" The Local Government Association's (LGA) environment spokesman, Martin Tett, said: ""Councils being able to issue increased fines to litter louts, who show no consideration for the community they live in, will send a strong message to those who think their laziness is more important than the environment in which they live. ""Allowing councils to fine the owners of vehicles which litter is thrown from, rather than expecting councils to prove who exactly in the vehicle had thrown litter, is also something that the LGA has long called for."" Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, said: ""There is no excuse for car litter louts. ""Tossing rubbish from vehicles spoils the environment, costs millions and puts road workers' lives at risk when they have to clear up. ""The majority of our members support higher fines for littering and we welcome these steps to tackle this unnecessary problem. ""It is not difficult for car occupants to bag it and bin it.""

"Red Cross volunteers are providing help and a drop-in centre has been set up for those affected Gas supplies to thousands of residents have remained cut off for a third day in a Yorkshire town. Contractors working on a housing scheme caused damage to the mains pipe in the Silsden area, near Bradford, on Friday, affecting more than 3,000 properties. Engineers restored gas to 600 homes, but it could be another three days until the whole town is reconnected. Northern Gas Networks (NGN) said it was the largest incident it had dealt with. Barratt, the builder responsible for the Belton Road housing development where the contractors were working, has apologised to residents for the inconvenience. Damage was caused to the mains supply by a contractor working on Barratt Homes Saxon Dene development A major community operation has swung into place with Red Cross and community volunteers providing help as well as the council and police. A drop-in centre has been set up at St James' Church hall and hundreds of heaters and other items have been distributed along with food vouchers. Shower facilities were also provided at Keighley Leisure Centre until 16:00 GMT and will be reopened on Monday from 09:00 to 17:00. Allow Twitter content?

Posting on Silsden Buzz, a community Facebook page, Pauline Whitaker said: ""I can't praise enough NGN and all the workers that have come from far and near."" Another resident Gwendda Greaves said: ""The community spirit in Silsden these last few days has been just amazing."" Hundreds of staff and volunteers have been helping out in the community Other gas companies have supported the operation, with engineers from firms including Cadent, Wales & West Utilities and SGN helping out. Iain Foster, NGN network supply strategy manager, said: ""We have been able to reconnect a number of customers and would ask residents for their ongoing patience as we continue this work. ""We are still expecting it to take a number of days as we systematically reinstate gas supplies to the network."" Food vouchers have been given out to affected residents Engineers have been drafted in from across the country Meanwhile, NGN said it was working with Northern Powergrid, which is monitoring the electricity network for any potential knock-on surges in demand while residents are without gas. Any significant overloading of the network could increase chances of damage and result in a power cut.

"This video can not be played North Korean leader Kim Jong-un clapped along, like many others at the concert North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his wife have watched South Korean K-pop stars perform in a rare event in Pyongyang. Mr Kim clapped along and then met performers backstage where he conversed and took pictures, said reports. It is the first musical delegation to visit in more than a decade as the leaders of the two countries on the divided peninsula prepare to meet. More than 11 acts are in Pyongyang for two shows. The North sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. The exchanges come amid thawing relations between the Koreas after months of tension. The concert, titled Spring is Coming, took place on Sunday evening local time at the 1,500-seat East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, said South Korean media. The delegation, which combines K-pop, rock and other genres, is set to perform again on Tuesday. Koreas set date for leaders' face-to-face North Korea crisis in 300 words Are North and South Korea friends again? Mr Kim is the first North Korean leader ever to attend a performance by an artistic group from the South, said South Korea's official news agency, Yonhap. The South Korean musicians rehearse before the performance His sister Kim Yo-jong and the country's nominal head of state Kim Yong-nam are also said to have attended. Kim Jong-un ""showed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics"", the South's culture minister Do Jong-hwan told journalists, according to Reuters news agency. Earlier, a North Korean audience also watched a South Korean taekwondo squad perform, this time without Mr Kim. Mr Kim has agreed to hold summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week during his first overseas trip. The third inter-Korean summit - there were also meetings in 2000 and 2007 - is due to be held on 27 April. No date has been set for the US-North Korean summit. This video can not be played There are high-flying kicks galore as South Korean taekwondo athletes perform in Pyongyang before the music concert Meanwhile, the US and South Korea have begun their annual military drills, which have been scaled down compared with previous years as both countries prepare for talks with North Korea. Although nearly 300,000 South Korean troops and 24,000 American troops will take part, the drill will be a month shorter than usual and will not involve nuclear submarines. In the past, the drills have infuriated North Korea but correspondents say that this time Pyongyang is keeping relatively quiet. Mr Kim reportedly told visiting South Korean officials that he understood that the exercises had to go ahead. The musicians performing in Pyongyang include: A five-member girl group, Red Velvet headlined at the Pyeongchang Games this year. The popular quintet who first formed in 2014 are still seen as relative newcomers, but have already managed to scoop up their fair share of awards. They have also got a large following on social media, with some 4.5 million followers on Instagram alone. This video can not be played Rock band YB will also be performing in North Korea A member of undoubtedly one of Korea's most famous K-pop groups, Seohyun made her music debut in 2007 as a member of the all-female Girls' Generation. The group shot to stardom in 2009, making Seohyun one of today's most recognisable K-pop singers. In February, the 26-year old performed alongside North Korea's 137-strong Samjiyon Orchestra, which was part of North Korea's art troupe during the recent Winter Games. The 61-year-old singer's 1984 song Love Maze,externalwas said to have been a hit across the Korean peninsula and can still be heard playing in Pyongyang restaurants. It is also said to have been a favourite of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. This is Mrs Choi's fourth time performing in the North. An industry veteran, Cho is considered one of the most influential figures in South Korea's music scene. Cho Yong-pil (r) arrives in Pyongyang In an interview with Billboard in 2013, the 68-year-old singer was dubbed a ""K-pop legend"". This is not his first performance in North Korea. Mr Cho made his first debut in Pyongyang in 2005, where he held a solo concert attended by some 7,000 North Koreans - making him the most recent South Korean singer to perform in the North. Another iconic singer in South Korea, Lee Sun-hee first made her debut in 1984. The now 53-year-old travelled to the North for a joint concert in 2003, which marked the opening of the Ryugyong Chung Ju-yung Gymnasium - one of the performance venues for the upcoming concert.

"This video can not be played Joshua wants 'private' Wilder negotiation Negotiations for a world heavyweight title unification fight between Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder could start next week, says promoter Barry Hearn. Joshua is eyeing Wilder's WBC belt after adding the WBO title to his IBF and WBA crowns witha unanimous points win over Joseph Parkeron Saturday. ""It is a fight Anthony Joshua really wants and I think he wants it this year,"" Hearn said. But Joshua, 28, says he will not pay Wilder a financial ""bonus"". Hearn, chairman and founder of Joshua's promoters Matchroom, told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme: ""Anthony Joshua wants all the belts - that is the big card Deontay Wilder has got to play [but] commercially, Joshua is far bigger than Deontay Wilder. ""I think Wilder would come over here [the UK] because in the world we live in, in boxing, the couple of million dollars Wilder is getting for a fight is pretty small fry in comparison to the rewards that await him for a Joshua fight. ""I think negotiations will start next week."" Joshua beats Parker to take WBO title Relive how Joshua beat Parker on points Podcast: Joshua v Parker: Joshua solid but unspectacular in points win A bout between Joshua and Wilder would deliver the first man to hold all four major heavyweight titles. Joshua says he is in ""the most powerful"" negotiating position, adding: ""Why do I do all this work to give someone else a bonus? Am I getting a bonus now?"" Pointing at his titles, he added: ""This is what it's all about, our side are serious about the negotiations. ""I think 2018 was about getting all the belts and we are one away now. I'm not in the business of hype, hype, hype. I'd love to maybe go to America and look at the landscape and see how serious they are, deal with it behind closed doors. ""Negotiations are on social media a lot now but it's serious business and I think you have to sit down privately. ""Look at every one of these belts now, I will have to be the most powerful man on a negotiating table."" Price suffers brutal Povetkin knockout Burnett retains title with dominant win Deontay Wilder holds the WBC belt Joshua said he did not condone comments Wilder is now under investigation by the WBC for after hestated he wants ""a body"" on his fight record.,external ""Perhaps education could have come a little earlier for him,"" said Hearn. ""It was a horrible thing to say and something I am sure he regrets, but in the heat of the moment he is just trying to be famous."" And Joshua's camp seem ardent in their approach to negotiations, with promoter Eddie Hearn - Barry's son - stating they have repeatedly overpaid opponents to face Joshua and will not resort to ""charity"" when it comes to Wilder, who turned down an invitation to sit ringside in Cardiff. Eddie Hearn thinks if the Joshua-Wilder clash does not happen in 2018 there will be ""serious problems"" as the bodies Joshua represents as a champion - the IBF, WBA and WBO - will call mandatory challengers, meaning Joshua may have to drop a belt if he wants to avoid a fight in hope of facing Wilder. ""The whole point of the Wilder fight is to win the final belt,"" he said. ""It would not quite be the history fight. ""If his team step up, it could happen next. They are so erratic and unpredictable. Wilder will get what he deserves. He hasn't worked this hard, to get all these belts."" Referee Giuseppe Quartarone kept the fighters apart on several occasions Eddie Hearn dismissed comments made by Parker's trainer Kevin Barry who stated the Italian referee at Cardiff's Principality Stadium could not understand English when asked about how he would officiate before the bout. Giuseppe Quartarone was criticised for not allowing the two fighters to engage when up close. Such tactics were critical to Parker, who had a six-inch reach disadvantage which showed as Joshua kept him at distance with the jab and left hooks. ""We are not blaming the referee but I wanted to fight and work on the inside,"" said Parker, 26.  ""I guess if I was allowed on the inside I could have done more and thrown more."" Parker's promoter David Higgins said he would not want to use Quartarone again but the New Zealand fighter's team were unanimous in stating the better man won on the night. ""I felt fit late on, maybe I was too cautious,"" added Parker, who now has one defeat in 25 bouts. ""Everything is learning. I could have done more but I just didn't throw all the punches I wanted to throw."" Parker (left) has never been knocked down as an amateur or a professional Joshua, undefeated in 21 contests, went the distance for the first time in his career and his trainer Robert McCracken rated it a ""nine out of 10"" display as they ""negated"" threats throughout. And Joshua insisted he knew he had won at the bell and was at no point hurt. Nonetheless, Wilder and former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury were quick to criticise on social media. ""I knew how to break him down and put him in a position so he couldn't give much back,"" added Joshua. ""Every time he came forward I just rammed that jab in his face. ""We've always been in at the deep end with high expectations. I just focus on improving. I know the expectations of what `I can achieve are very possible but without dedication they won't happen. The sky is the limit. ""I'm not elated because I don't let the highs get to my head. We have to go again soon. ""There's a lot more to come. We have to roll with the punches. I am developing. My amateur career was three-and-a-half years. This October is five years as a pro. ""In boxing I have always put my heart on my sleeve and showed the world good and bad. I will always be honest, give you who I am and my best. Everyone will enjoy this journey and you'll see the good, bad and ugly. ""If I can keep controlling fighters like that, I will be about a long time.""

"Child burial fees were abolished in Wales last year The costs of child burials and cremations are to be waived in England to bring them in line with Wales, the prime minister has announced. Theresa May said the fees will be met by a new Children's Funeral Fund to help parents struggling to pay for funerals for children aged under 18. It comes after a campaign by Labour MP Carolyn Harris who had to take out a loan to bury her son. The Swansea East MP called the decision ""dignified and compassionate"". Child burial fees were abolished throughout Walesin November following the lengthy campaign by Ms Harris whose eight-year-old son Martin was killed in 1989. In response to the government's announcement, she said: ""After so much pressure and so much time, families right across the United Kingdom can know that if they're ever in that terrible, terrible position when they lose a child, that there will now be a pot of money available to make sure that child has a dignified and respectful funeral."" Carolyn Harris MP had to take out a loan to bury her son Ms Harris told BBC Radio 5 live she was feeling ""a mixed emotion"" following the campaign, saying it had been a ""very tough, painful journey"". ""It's for every parent who has to face what me and my husband had to face,"" she added. Mrs May hailed the ""dignity and strength"" of Ms Harris, adding: ""In the raw pain of immediate loss, it cannot be right that grieving parents should have to worry about how to meet the funeral costs for a child they hoped to see grow into adulthood. ""In the darkest moment of any parent's life there is little light - but there can be support. ""That is why I have asked for the Children's Funeral Fund to be set up in England; for Carolyn, in memory of her son Martin, and in support of all those parents overwhelmed by such harrowing loss."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the fund was ""welcome and wonderful news"". He also paid tribute to Ms Harris' campaign, saying:  ""No parent who has gone through the heart-breaking experience of losing a child should be left struggling to cover the cost of a funeral.""

"Mark Stoneman has made five Test half-centuries since making his debut in August 2017 Second Test, Christchurch (Hagley Oval), day three: England 307 & 202-3Vince 76, Stoneman 60, Boult 2-38 New Zealand 278:Watling 85, Broad 6-54, Anderson 4-76 England lead by 231 runs Scorecard James Vince and Mark Stoneman's 123-run partnership helped England take control on the third day of the second Test against New Zealand. The hosts were bowled out for 278 in the morning session to give England a slim first-innings lead of 29. Alastair Cook fell cheaply for 14 but Stoneman (60) and Vince (76) kept the New Zealand bowling attack at bay. Both players fell in the evening session before bad light ended play with England on 202-3, a lead of 231. England have had a long and tough winter schedule but they enjoyed a good day in Christchurch with both bat and ball. Stuart Broad produced his best Test bowling performance for some time as he finished with 6-54, while James Anderson continued his strong winter with 4-76. Stoneman and Vince performed well but both players will be frustrated to not make three figures and secure their places at the top of the order. Joe Root (30 not out) and Dawid Malan (19 not out) will look to build on England's lead when play resumes at 23:30 BST on Sunday. Podcast: Test Match Special meet Sir Richard Hadlee England in New Zealand - results & squad James Vince's highest Test score is 83 against Australia in Brisbane in November 2017 This was an important innings for England's top order, who have been criticised over the winter for their inconsistency and inability to get England off to strong starts. Opener Cook made a double century in Melbourne during the Ashes but has not passed 50 in any other innings, while neither Stoneman or Vince have made a big score that could secure their place. Cook started positively here, pulling Tim Southee for four, but a loose shot and a lack of foot movement cost him as Trent Boult found the edge of his bat shortly after lunch. He finishes the tour with a total of 23 runs in four innings - the leanest series of his career. Vince has been criticised for innings that are more style than substance, while before Sunday, Stoneman had reached fifty four times but failed to push on. The two offered up chances. Stoneman was dropped twice on 48 and 57 and reprieved on review after being given out caught behind, while Vince was lucky to not be caught twice off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi. Vince's cover drives proved as aesthetically pleasing as ever, while Stoneman was strong square of the wicket as he registered his Test best score. However, they fell in similar - and frustrating - fashion. Stoneman got a thick edge on a wide Southee delivery that wicketkeeper BJ Watling, leaping high to his left, held on to, before Vince flashed hard and nicked Boult to first slip. Vince ends the winter with 336 runs and an average of 30.54 from 11 innings, while Stoneman has scored 393 runs in 13 innings at 30.23. Stuart Broad (left) took his 16th Test five-wicket haul on day three in Christchurch Despite bowling New Zealand out for under 300 - the first time England have done so in the first innings of an away Test match since October 2016 - the visitors were a touch wasteful at times. Southee took advantage of the old ball by pulling the fourth delivery of the morning to the boundary, before thrashing Mark Wood for consecutive fours. The new ball paid dividends for England as Anderson bowled Watling with an outswinger for 85, before Ish Sodhi (one) edged Broad through to Jonny Bairstow to hand Broad his first Test five-wicket haul in 45 innings. Broad has been working on his bowling action since a disappointing Ashes series, and his wickets in Christchurch came from a fuller length that forced the batsmen to play. With Southee dismissed three balls after reaching his fourth Test half-century, England were looking at a 68-run lead, but the three pace bowlers dropped too short too quickly and allowed the tail to settle in. Neil Wagner took 13 runs off Anderson, including a hooked six over fine leg, while number 11 batsman Boult provided an entertaining cameo of 16 from 22 deliveries. It was ironic, then, that Boult was eventually dismissed by a short ball as he top-edged a pull shot off Broad down to fine leg for 16. ""At times, it felt as though the stumps were more of an ornament, rather than a target for the England bowlers,"" ex-New Zealand batsman Jeremy Coney said on Test Match Special. New Zealand pace bowler Trent Boult, speaking to TMS:""Lower-order runs were vital out there - but England came out and played very nicely to get a 200-run lead. ""It's turned into a very nice batting track, there's a lot of wickets for us still to take. Definitely a big morning tomorrow. We can't look too far ahead, but we're still well and truly in this game."" Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann:""Cook's early dismissal allowed us to have a trial match with Stoneman and Vince - had either got a low score today, I don't think we'd have seen them again. ""But Stoneman hasn't answered any questions, though I still think he could open for England. And Vince is the most hair-pullingly, frustrating batsman to watch - he could easily average 50 in Test cricket, but he just has a blip of concentration and gets out exactly the same way nearly every time he bats. I think they're vulnerable."" Ex-England spinner Vic Marks:""Mark Stoneman looked less secure than James Vince, but he looked more fluent here than he's done at any other time in the series. ""Stoneman scored a patchy 50 in Auckland, but his stock is rising. He looked good in the first two or three Tests of the Ashes without scoring many runs."" England batting coach Graham Thorpe, speaking to Sky Sports:""We've had a good day. To get a lead - we'd like it to have been more but I thought we bowled really well throughout. Stuart and Jimmy were fantastic. ""You can tell when they were both walking off that Stoneman and Vince were disappointed. They'll want to get that Test century.""

"President Trump (right) accuses Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos, of not paying enough for deliveries President Donald Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon, suggesting the online retail giant is ripping off the US Postal Service. The US Post Office would lose $1.50 (Â£1.07) ""on average for each package it delivers for Amazon"", he tweeted, but supporters of Amazon dispute this. Mr Trump also said the Washington Post newspaper was a ""lobbyist"" for Amazon. Amazon owner Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which publishes stories unpalatable to the president. Like most mainstream media, the Post has reported on stories including Special Counsel Robert Mueller's continuing investigation into links between the Trump election campaign and Russia, as well hashis alleged relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels. Saturday's edition details how three different legal teams are scrutinising the Trump Organization's accounts. Mr Trump's attacks on Amazon have seen its share price fall in recent days, amid concern that he might push for its power to be curbed by anti-trust laws. The president tweeted thatthe US Post Office was losing ""billions of dollars"",externalin its contract with Amazon. ""If the P.O. 'increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.' This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!"" he continued, quoting the New York Times. Amazon has not commented. But supporters of Amazon point out that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the industry, has found that the US Postal Service makes a profit from its contract with the company. This in turn helps subsidise the costs of letter delivery, which avoids the need for price rises. It is unprecedented for a sitting president to single out one company for such vicious attacks, says the BBC's Business Correspondent, Joe Lynam. Friends of Mr Trump in the commercial property sector have also been urging him to protect them from digital retail giants as they see shopping malls closing and rents falling, our correspondent adds.

"A deal has been reached to allow seriously injured people to leave the besieged Eastern Ghouta region A deal has been reached to evacuate critically injured people from Douma, the last rebel-held town in Syria's Eastern Ghouta region, reports say. The agreement follows negotiations between the rebel group Jaish al-Islam, civic leaders and Russia. The wounded will be taken to Idlib, which is still in rebel hands. Talks are continuing to spare Douma from a military offensive by the Syrian army and its allies, who currently surround it. The rebels in Douma have denied they are negotiating an evacuation deal for the tens of thousands of civilians still living there. However, the wounded will be allowed to leave under an agreement made with the Russian military late on Saturday, Reuters news agency says. 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria?

The Syrian army has urged those still holding out in Douma to leave or face a full-scale offensive. Eastern Ghouta: Who's fighting whom?,external Tens of thousands of people have now left the suburbs east of Syria's capital, Damascus, which were once home to almost two million. The Syrian army offers defeated rebels a choice between switching sides, or giving up their guns and relocating to government-controlled zones. In a televised statement on Saturday, a military spokesman said the army had brought security to the capital, and safeguarded its links to the rest of the country. Russian military police have been supervising the evacuation of rebels and their families from the Eastern Ghouta The Eastern Ghouta has been besieged by the Syrian government since 2013. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described conditions there as ""hell on earth"". Residents suffered intense bombardment by Russian-backed Syrian government forces in recent weeks. Food, fuel and medical stocks are low, and the relentless air strikes have driven many to seek shelter underground, where they are largely without sanitation. Stories of love amid Eastern Ghouta's bombs The rebels have accused the government-backed forces of using napalm, chlorine and incendiary bombs against civilian areas. A member of the Syrian Civil Defence (known as the White Helmets) carries a wounded man after air strikes on Douma UN war crimes experts are investigating several reports of rockets allegedly containing chlorine being fired this year. The Ghouta assault has left more than 1,600 civilians dead and thousands more wounded, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syria's military says it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from those it terms terrorists, and end their rocket attacks on the capital. The rebels have fired their own shells at government-controlled areas of Damascus, causing dozens of casualties. In January the Observatory said at least 60 people had been killed due to rebel bombardment since mid-November 2017.

""I've got twice the amount of work to do so we're going to crack on,"" he joked. Guest announcer and comedian Stephen Merchant told Dec: ""I can't help but notice a little bit of space on the stage there - any chance I can come down?"" But he added: ""You don't want me standing next to you because I'm 6ft 7in and you're considerably smaller."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The pre-recorded Saturday Knight Takeaway sketch segment - featuring Ant with Dec, Joanna Lumley, Emilia Fox and Michael Sheen - was shown. After the sketch was played, referring to Ant, Merchant joked: ""That other bloke was good - you should do more stuff with him, he was good."" By Ben Sutherland, BBC News Could Dec cope without Ant? The answer was - yes, generally very well. There's no denying that he was nervous to begin with - the tension visible in his body language; his speech was that slight bit quicker than usual. But he was welcomed to the stage with a massive roar from the audience, and having got into the groove with the usual catchphrases, he nodded to Ant's absence, noting: ""I've got twice the amount of work to do."" And the nerves were understandable. He had no more idea than anyone else how Ant's future might pan out - and he could hardly afford for the general impression to be that he is useless without his partner. At the very least, he isn't.

"Tombs at the Djingareyber mosque in Timbuktu were smashed by Islamist militants in 2012 The International Criminal Court in the Hague has taken into custody a man wanted for war crimes in Mali, after the authorities there handed him over. Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud headed the Islamic police in Timbuktu when it was under the control of jihadist militants five years ago. He is accused of victimising women and girls by approving their forced marriages to Islamist fighters. He is also alleged to have helped destroy ancient mausoleums in Timbuktu. The arrest warrant for Mr Al Hassan listed crimes against humanity including ""torture, rape and sexual slavery; persecution of the inhabitants of Timbuktu on religious and gender grounds; and other inhumane acts"".

"In parts of India, owning a horse confers wealth and power A young farmer from the lowest rung of India's caste hierarchy - the Dalit community - has been beaten to death, apparently for owning and riding a horse. Police in Gujarat state said three upper-caste men had been detained for questioning. The victim's father said his son had been warned not to ride the horse as this was an upper-caste privilege. Owning a horse is seen as a symbol of power and wealth in parts of India. A senior police officer said other possible motives had not been ruled out. What is India's caste system? Pradeep Rathod, 21, was found dead in a pool of blood near Timbi village in Gujarat state late on Thursday. The horse was also found dead nearby, his father said. In a complaint filed to police, his father said his son had loved horses so he had bought him one. ""My son's love for horses led to his murder,"" the father said according to AFP news agency, which has seen the statement. ""About a week ago, when I was riding the horse with my son, one of the persons from the upper caste Kshatriya [warrior] community warned us not to ride the horse in the village. ""He said that people of Dalit community cannot ride horses, only Kshatriyas can ride horses. He also threatened to kill us if we did not sell the horse,"" the complaint read. India has a history of attacks and discrimination against the Dalit community, formerly known as ""untouchables"", reports the BBC's South Asia editor Anbarasan Ethirajan. Last October,a Dalit man was killed by a group of men for reportedly attending a traditional Hindu dance performancealso in Gujarat.

"Divers from Sri Lanka's navy had to reinforce the vessel's frame before raising it A British passenger ship that sank after it was bombed in a Japanese air strike in World War Two has been raised off the Sri Lanka coast after 75 years. The SS Sagaing, whose passengers and cargo were largely saved back in 1942, has been refloated with the help of a team of divers from Sri Lanka's navy. It had been resting about 35ft (10.7m) under the water at Trincomalee harbour. The salvage operation took several months and was carried out by Sri Lanka's Eastern Naval Command unit. The operation to bring the wreck to the surface took several months It required the strengthening of the 452ft long vessel's main structural framework, which began on 11 September 2017, Sri Lanka's navy said in a statement on Saturday. The team of divers also erected an artificial side to the ship in order to seal an area before ""dewatering"" it to recover lost buoyancy. Stunning pictures of Black Sea shipwrecks Prior to the ship's refloat, the damaged sunken vessel was used as a pier for other naval ships in the harbour.

"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party A row about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been prompted by Jeremy Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. But this is not the first time the Labour leader has faced calls to deal with anti-Semitism in recent years. The current row can be traced back to two allegations in 2016 - a year after Mr Corbyn became leader. The first was against the MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah. It was revealed that the year before she became the MP,she shared a graphicshowing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"". A number of other posts emerged, with her comparing Israel to the Nazis and saying ""the Jews are rallying"". She apologised and resigned from her post as John McDonnell's parliamentary private secretary. This video can not be played 2016: Naz Shah blames ignorance for posts she admits were anti-Semitic Mr Corbyn said Ms Shah's remarks were ""offensive and unacceptable"", andshe was suspended from the party. She was reinstated in July and blamed her ""ignorance"" for the posts, admitting they were anti-Semitic. Labour's National Executive Committee gave her a formal warning, told her to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute and warned that if there was another incident she would be expelled. It was during the row over Ms Shah that the former London Mayor Ken Livingstone made his own comments that were alleged to have been anti-Semitic. Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending the MP and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic. He added: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" This led to widespread criticism of Mr Livingstone, with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of being a ""Nazi apologist"" in front of a media scrum. This video can not be played 2016: Ken Livingstone said Naz Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding that the Nazi leader was ""a monster from start to finish"". But he said he had simply been quoting historical ""facts"". The long-time ally of Mr Corbyn wassuspended by the party for a year, but he refused to apologise and continued to repeat his comments. He was then suspended for a further 12 months in April 2017 after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Mr Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. His suspension hasnow been extended againpending the outcome of an internal investigation. It was after Ms Shah's comments and Mr Livingstone's defence thatMr Corbyn announced an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the partyat the end of April 2016. It was led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of human rights campaign group Liberty. She announced she had joined the Labour Party after her appointment as chair on the inquiry. The inquiry lasted for two months and at the end of June 2016, Ms Chakrabarti concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism,there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Ms Chakrabarti made 20 recommendations,external, including: Abusive references to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics and racial or religious tropes and stereotypes should have no place in Labour Party discourse. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. There should be procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure. The appointment of a general counsel to the Labour Party to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. The party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff. However, she said she did not approve of lifetime bans for party membership. Two months later, she became a Labour peer - the only appointment to the House of Lords Mr Corbyn has so far made. Around the same time,allegations of anti-Semitism arose from the Oxford University Labour Club. They claimed that members of the club had discussed Zionists rigging British elections, frequently used the term ""Zio"" and said that European attacks on Jews were justified because of Gaza. The allegations led to the Labour Party's national student organisation conducting their own inquiry, and its report was leaked to the press in the summer of 2016. In it,Baroness Royall concluded there had been ""some incidents"" of anti-Semitic behaviourand ""behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated"" in the club. However, she said there was ""no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic"". Just under a year later, two students were cleared by the NEC's disputes committee of being anti-Semitic. 'Anti-Semitic behaviour' was said to have taken place at the Oxford University Labour Club Despite the inquiries,promises to adopt tough new rulesto tackle anti-Semitism at its conference and pledges from Mr Corbyn that racism would be ""rooted out"", a number of other allegations have come to light during his tenure. These included: Labour activist Jackie Walker being suspended from the party in 2016 forclaiming Jewish people were ""financiers of the sugar and slave trade"" Author Miko Peled allegedly saying during a speech at a fringe conference event that party membersshould be able to debate whether or not the Holocaust happened,external- he is not a member of the party Brighton and Hove Labour housing campaigner Daniel Harris being suspended afterposting a video on Facebook,externalfeaturing the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures A member from Barnet, London, being suspendedfor writing anti-Semitic posts on social media, leading to a councillor receiving abuse for reporting it Now, Mr Corbyn himself is facing criticism aftersending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockefeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Allow Twitter content?

The Labour leader has since called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by anti-Semitism in the party. Aftera letter from Jewish groupsthat held Mr Corbyn personally responsible for the ""hostile"" environment Jews in the Labour Party face, he is facing calls from some of his own MPs to take tougher action. But members of the Jewish Voice for Labour group claim the two organisations behind the letter do not represent the views of the ""great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness"" and that there is ""massively more anti-Semitism on the right of politics than on the left"". Responding to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council with a letter of his own, Mr Corbyn said he would not ""tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement"". He acknowledged that anti-Semitic attitudes had ""surfaced more often in [Labour's] ranks in recent years"" and emphasised the need for a ""deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism"". Mr Corbyn also said he recognised the ""overdue"" need for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Chakrabarti report and apologised for ""not having studied the content of the [Mear One] mural more closely"".

"""Occasionally toxic."" That's not Jeremy Corbyn's description of what he now admits are ""pockets"" of the Labour Party where prejudice against Jews can be found. It's the description of the atmosphere in the Labour Party inan official 2016 report,externalthat investigated claims of anti-Semitism inside the party after concerns were raised over many, many months. There lies the problem. Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015 and even in the heat of that summer's Corbynmania fears were raised about the attitude of some of the activists and campaigners he had associated with over the years towards the Jewish people. Jewish groups in scathing attack on Corbyn How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded As one senior Labour figure says, the concern was then - as it is believed to be now by many people in the party - that ""he is not anti-Semitic but he has been seen to tolerate it"". Back then, after some months of agitation, that report was undertaken to stamp out the problem, and recommended a series of ideas to root out anti-Semitic prejudice and other forms of racism too. That was in June 2016. But it was not to be what many hoped at the time - the final page of a hot and difficult debate. Since then many Labour MPs feel that an almost continuous flow of allegations have emerged, including evidence of Mr Corbyn's own unwitting participation in some online debates, with the party leadership accused of being slow and reluctant to take a strong stance, and the Labour machine crawling, rather than racing, to close down the problem. The issue is not helped by the suspicion that exists between different wings of the Labour Party. Some of Mr Corbyn's most ardent supporters believe that this is the latest attempt to undermine his leadership, rather than genuine concern. That includes some members of the Jewish community themselves, some of whom are planning their own demonstration in response to what they see as ""cynical, selective outrage"", from the Board of Deputies of British Jews. But the distress felt by many in the Labour movement about what's been happening is real. Talk to any of the MPs who have been victims of it and that much is clear. Jeremy Corbyn has always said that he condemns all forms of racism. But the perception that it has taken nearly three years to drag himto apologise for this specific form of prejudicethat will lead tonight to the extraordinary sight of the leaders of a major religion protesting outside Parliament against the attitude of the leader of the UK's main opposition party.

"The plane was inspected on Friday at Heathrow The UK has rejected a complaint from Russia over a search of one of its aircraft at London's Heathrow Airport, as a row over the poisoning of a former Russian spy deepens.

Dozens of diplomats have been expelled on both sides in the poisoning dispute. Moscow wants UK representation in Russia cut by a further 27 diplomats. Twenty-three had already been expelled by Russia in response to the UK's announcement of 23 Russian expulsions on 14 March. Ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on 4 March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok. Russian denies involvement. He is critically ill, but stable, while she is now said to be conscious and talking. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has meanwhile said it will consider a request for Russian consular access to Yulia, a Russian citizen. Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia have been in hospital since the attack Aeroflot flight SU2582 landed at Heathrow on Friday at 15:40 local time. Once passengers and crew had departed, a search began. But a man identified by Russian TV as pilot Vitaly Mitrofanov said he was confined to his cockpit by a the search team with a sniffer dog. The Border Force officers inspected the plane for up to three minutes before leaving with a ""thank you"", he added. The pilot maintains they ""gave no reasons"" for the inspection, and he was not allowed to ""observe their actions"" or accompany them in their work. UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a statement that it was ""routine for Border Force to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country"". He added: ""Once these checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey."" Former chief executive of the UK Border Agency Rob Whiteman said intelligence would have been a factor. ""This incident with the Aeroflot flight at Heathrow being searched would have been a routine security search which the security services would have undertaken acting on intelligence,"" he told the BBC. ""These searches are routine - they don't happen every day, but they do happen fairly regularly."" The Russian embassy in London accused Mr Wallace of trying to ""divert attention from the provocative actions by British law enforcement officers who have tried to search the aircraft without the captain present, in violation of the existing rules"". ""Mr Wallace's logic is difficult to comprehend. Aeroflot and Russian airports observe strict international security standards and didn't give rise to doubts in that respect. Moreover, it is quite strange to search for 'drugs and firearms' intended to be 'brought into the country' in an empty airplane ready to welcome departing passengers."" Earlier, Russia's transport ministry suggested the search was illegal and threatened to take similar action against British airlines. Russia is closing the US consulate in St Petersburg as part of its retaliatory measures The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month. The UK is adamant Russia is behind the poisoning of the Skripals - Russia denies it. Moscow has been taken aback by the strength of support for Britain by mainly Western countries, who announced the expulsion of 150 Russian diplomats over the course of three days earlier this week. Moscow responded in kind and then added to the number of British diplomats told to leave Russia. On Friday the British ambassador, Laurie Bristow, was told that the UK had a month to cut its diplomatic mission in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""The Russian response is regrettable but in light of Russia's previous behaviour, we anticipated a response. ""However, this doesn't change the facts of the matter: the attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday issued a warning over ""a situation that is similar, to a large extent, to what we lived during the Cold War"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"" for the decision by dozens of countries to expel Russian diplomats. Russia, Mr Lavrov said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"".

"A shortage of special needs funding means growing numbers of children are being left without suitable school places, a teachers' leader has warned. National Education Union leader Kevin Courtney said official statistics showed 4,050 special needs pupils were without a place in 2017 in England. He said it was a disgrace that such pupils were at home because councils were being ""starved"" of funds for them. The government said money for schools and special needs had been protected. It was due to rise to its highest ever level of Â£43bn in 2020, with Â£6bn allocated for special educational needs this year, it said. But theDepartment for Education figures,externalshowed the number of pupils with special needs (SEND) without a school place last year had more than doubled from 1,710 in 2016. The warning comes after it emerged scores of local authorities have asked to switch money targeted at their main schools budget to spend on children with special educational needs. Councils are allocated funds for special needs in both mainstream and special schools through their ""high needs"" budgets. They have been complaining of shortfalls in this budget as it has been ""cash flat"" for a number of years (ie, the total does not account for inflation). At the same time, the number of pupils on plans setting out their special needs, EHCPs, has been growing. Pupils on EHCPs have defined special needs for which extra support staff or equipment is required. It could be a result of a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome; the child may have a hearing or visual impairment or a complex combination of diagnosis or disabilities. Harrison Jonsson, left, is now being home schooled by his mother Sandy after he began to struggle at secondary school Sandy Jonsson's son Harrison, 11, suffers from autism and ADHD. He was given an EHCP in 2014 and received good care in primary school, but after moving to a secondary school in Swindon in September 2017, Harrison began to struggle. Ms Jonsson said he has had a nervous breakdown and subsequently developed an eating disorder and depression. As a result, the single mother - who runs a business from home - was forced to home school Harrison until at least September, as there are no other school places available. ""Unless you're significantly disabled or have a tangible form of autism you're thrown to the wolves,"" she said. ""With the EHCP there's a requirement for schools to make reasonable adjustment and none of this happened."" She believes there needs to be greater oversight on how EHCP money is spent by schools, and has campaigned on the issue. According to a survey by the Association of Directors of Children's Services, there was a Â£400m shortfall in high needs funding last year. On top of this, schools have to provide Â£6,000 per year per pupil on an EHCP. Mr Courtney said: ""Children are at home because local authorities don't have enough money to provide suitable education. ""Local authorities are being placed in an impossible position. ""They have a legal duty to plan high quality education for every child with SEND, but cuts have taken away the resources they need to educate children with complex needs."" WW2 shipwreck refloated by Sri Lanka navy The country where the British are blamed for everything The teenager sentenced to 241 years in prison As of this year, councils have to ask the education secretary for permission to do this unless they can get head teachers locally to agree. Official figures obtained by the BBC showed 48 local education authorities - almost a third - asked for permission to switch the money from the dedicated schools grant to their high needs budget. The DfE approved 16 and said no to 12. A further 20 councils withdrew their applications. West Sussex was one of the local authorities which asked to reallocate general schools budget cash to high needs. The DfE agreed to allow the council to take Â£2.2m from its general school funds to boost special educational needs services. Although its funding was boosted by Â£12.8m or 6.5% for the coming year, the number of pupils with special needs plans is likely to increase by 500 - an increase of 10%. The DfE said local authorities had always been able to adapt their funding allocation to meet local needs, as long as they followed a set criteria. ""The number of councils applying to do this has remained stable in recent years,"" it said. ""High needs funding has been protected in real terms over the next two years, and our extra Â£1.3bn investment for schools and high needs means we are giving local authorities more money for every pupil in every school.""

"This video can not be played Declan Donnelly joked he had ""twice the amount of work to do"" Declan Donnelly joked he had ""twice the amount of work to do"" as he presented Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant for the first time. The decision to host alone was made after Ant McPartlinwas charged with drink drivingfollowing a collision in south-west London. Ant still had some screen time in a pre-recorded comedy sketch. Show regulars Scarlett Moffatt and Stephen Mulhern also took on greater presenting roles. Coming down the steps to loud applause, Dec thanked the audience for the ""very, very warm welcome"". ""I've got twice the amount of work to do so we're going to crack on,"" he joked. Guest announcer and comedian Stephen Merchant told Dec: ""I can't help but notice a little bit of space on the stage there - any chance I can come down?"" But he added: ""You don't want me standing next to you because I'm 6ft 7in and you're considerably smaller."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The pre-recorded Saturday Knight Takeaway sketch segment - featuring Ant with Dec, Joanna Lumley, Emilia Fox and Michael Sheen - was shown. After the sketch was played, referring to Ant, Merchant joked: ""That other bloke was good - you should do more stuff with him, he was good."" By Ben Sutherland, BBC News Could Dec cope without Ant? The answer was - yes, generally very well. There's no denying that he was nervous to begin with - the tension visible in his body language; his speech was that slight bit quicker than usual. But he was welcomed to the stage with a massive roar from the audience, and having got into the groove with the usual catchphrases, he nodded to Ant's absence, noting: ""I've got twice the amount of work to do."" And the nerves were understandable. He had no more idea than anyone else how Ant's future might pan out - and he could hardly afford for the general impression to be that he is useless without his partner. At the very least, he isn't.

"Divers from Sri Lanka's navy had to reinforce the vessel's frame before raising it A British passenger ship that sank after it was bombed in a Japanese air strike in World War Two has been raised off the Sri Lanka coast after 75 years. The SS Sagaing, whose passengers and cargo were largely saved back in 1942, has been refloated with the help of a team of divers from Sri Lanka's navy. It had been resting about 35ft (10.7m) under the water at Trincomalee harbour. The salvage operation took several months and was carried out by Sri Lanka's Eastern Naval Command unit. The operation to bring the wreck to the surface took several months It required the strengthening of the 452ft long vessel's main structural framework, which began on 11 September 2017, Sri Lanka's navy said in a statement on Saturday. The team of divers also erected an artificial side to the ship in order to seal an area before ""dewatering"" it to recover lost buoyancy. Stunning pictures of Black Sea shipwrecks Prior to the ship's refloat, the damaged sunken vessel was used as a pier for other naval ships in the harbour.
