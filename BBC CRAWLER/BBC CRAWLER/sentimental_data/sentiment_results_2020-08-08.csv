"The Venezuelan military said it captured mercenaries after the attempted coup A Venezuelan court has sentenced two former American soldiers to 20 years in jail for trying to overthrow President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Luke Denman and Airan Berry were found guilty of conspiracy, illicit trafficking of weapons and terrorism. The pair were among 13 people arrested in May as they attempted to enter Venezuela by sea from Colombia. Attorney General Tarek William Saab said proceedings will continue against others accused of assisting the raid. In a tweet,external, Mr Saab shared images of vehicles, weapons and identity documents, and said the American ""mercenaries"" had ""admitted their responsibility for the facts"". 'Bay of Piglets': A 'bizarre' plot to capture a president Venezuela crisis in 300 words Venezuela accuses Colombia of sea invasion US President Donald Trump, long an opponent of socialist President Maduro, has denied accusations by Venezuela that he was behind the incident. The US backs opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and recognises him as the country's legitimate leader. Denman, 34, and Berry, 41, are former special forces soldiers who appeared in video shown on Venezuelan state TV earlier this year. In the video, Denman appears to confess to his involvement in ""Operation Gideon"" - a plot to either kill President Maduro or kidnap him and take him to the United States. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro (left) said the plot by Luke Denman and Airan Berry (right) was orchestrated by US President Donald Trump He explained that he was hired to train Venezuelans in Colombia before returning to Caracas and taking control of an airport to allow Mr Maduro to be taken out of the country. Denman said he and Berry were contracted by a Florida-based security company, Silvercorp USA, to carry out the operation. The firm is headed by Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who has openly admitted involvement in the operation. The Washington Post has published a document which it says is a contract between Silvercorp and the Venezuelan opposition worth $213m (Â£170m) to invade Venezuela and overthrow President Maduro. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ denied having anything to do with Mr Goudreau. Relations between the US and Venezuela are tense. Mr Maduro has accused America of manipulating political opposition to steal the country's vast oil wealth. America and Mr GuaidÃ³, meanwhile, have blamed the president for Venezuela's economic collapse.

"""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant. Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has beena surge in requests for redundancy advice,external. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.

"There were protests about the redundancy plans when Tate Modern reopened on 27 July The head of the Tate art galleries has defended plans to cut around 200 jobs in their shops and cafes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Sadly at the moment the trading business is too big,"" Maria Balshaw told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Host Lauren Laverne asked her about the ""question mark over 200 jobs at Tate Enterprises"", given ""no redundancies have been announced at the galleries"". Balshaw said the company had delayed the job losses ""for as long as we can"". But fewer staff will be needed in the commercial arm because visitor numbers are expected to stay at around 50% for ""quite a long time"", she said. Maria Balshaw runs Tate galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives She told the programme: ""We are consulting with staff about redundancies. But we have used as much of our own reserves as we can to preserve the jobs throughout this period. ""So staff were kept on 100% pay all the way through lockdown, and we've delayed this period of consultation for as long as we can. ""We don't want to lose any staff, but we know we have to, otherwise the business won't be able to trade."" There were protests outside Tate Modern when it, and the other Tate galleries, reopened on 27 July, having been closed due to coronavirus since 17 March.

Tate Enterprises Ltd is the commercial subsidiary, which operates retail, publishing and catering within the galleries. A number of MPs have raised concerns about the cuts,external, saying those affected were ""low paid with a significant number at risk coming from the BAME community"". On Desert Island Discs, Laverne said the union representing those affected wants Tate to intervene. Balshaw replied: ""We have intervened. We're almost unique in that we run all our own shops and cafes, and that means that everything that people experience at Tate reflects our values. ""But that means, when we are facing 50% fewer visitors coming to our galleries for probably quite a long time, that sadly at the moment the trading business is too big, because we won't be able to open all the cafes and the shops in the same way."" She pledged that ""as visitors do return and as we get properly post-Covid, they [the affected workers] will be given the first option to come back and work for us because we recognise the hard work that they do and how valuable they are to us"".

"Face coverings have become mandatory in more indoor settings in England and Scotland following a recent spike in coronavirus cases. Places where coverings must now be worn in both countries include museums, places of worship and aquariums. Other new settings in England include cinemas and funeral homes, and in Scotland, banks and beauty salons. Coverings will also becomecompulsory in all public enclosed spaces in Northern Irelandfrom Monday. It comes as new quarantine rules for travellers to the UK took effect at 04:00 BST. Anyone now arriving in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland from Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas will have to quarantine for two weeks.  The same rules have already been put in place in Wales. Quarantines have already been re-imposed for passengers from Spain and Luxembourg. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? How to stay cool in a face mask Stricter lockdown measures introduced in Preston UK 'won't hesitate' to add to quarantine list Lockdown measures were reintroduced in Preston from midnightafter a rise in Covid-19 cases. Residents in the Lancashire city are facing stricter restrictions, which include banning separate households from meeting each other at home. The move brings Preston in line with measures in east Lancashire, Greater Manchester and parts of west Yorkshire. The number of cases in Preston has jumped sharply in the past week, and almost half are among people aged 30 and under. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes to the rules on face coverings in England last weekwhen he also postponed the further easing of lockdown due to the spike in virus cases. Those who break the law on wearing masks in England face fines of up to Â£100, with the PM saying there would be a ""greater police presence"" to ensure the rules were being followed. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon,announced the new face mask rules, along with other measures, on Friday,explaining that the ""risks are heightened"" as the country eases lockdown restrictions. In Wales and Northern Ireland it is only currently compulsory to wear a face covering on public transport. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Toby Bradon, general manager for Vue cinemas in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, said wearing face coverings had become ""the new normal"" but customers would be able to remove their masks to eat and drink in its cinemas. He added: ""We recognise that some people will be exempt so it is appropriate that we encourage people to wear them but we won't be policing it."" London's Science Museum said while customers would be required to wear face masks in line with government guidance when it reopens on 19 August, it hoped visitors would be ""respectful"" of those who were exempt from doing so. Those exempt from wearing face coverings include children under 11, those with a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability and employees in indoor settings. People are also able to remove their mask if asked to do so in a bank for identification or in order to receive treatment or services, such as a haircut. Under the government rules face coverings are not required for those getting married or at restaurants, bars and pubs with table service. Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said pupils over 11 years of age will be expected to wear masks. But he reiterated they will not be necessary in the classrooms as ""there are a whole raft of other measures we've introduced in schools to make sure we minimise the risk of transmission"". ""The advice we've had about wearing masks in school is if they're not competently handled you can actually increase the risk of spreading the virus,"" he said. LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? In Scotland, the expanded list of settings where masks are required was announced alongside the tightening of other anti-coronavirus measures, particularly for the hospitality sector. From Friday 14 August the recording of contact details for customers of pubs and other venues will become mandatory rather than advisory. Businesses should also be asking people to pre-book tables and there should be no queues. On Saturday, the UK reported a further 55 people had died with the virus, taking the total to 46,566. A further 758 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours,according to the latest government statistics,external. On Friday, the latest reproduction number - the R number - for the UK was published and was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.0. However, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said it did ""not have confidence"" that the R number in England was below one. R describes the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. A value above 1.0 means cases are growing exponentially, whereas if the number is kept lower than 1.0 the disease will eventually peter out. But it came as data from the Office for National Statistics suggestedthe number of people testing positive for coronavirus may be levelling offin England. In another development, the Department for Transport has announced that emergency funding for bus and tram operators in England is being extended. The money will support services in September when schools are set to fully reopen and brings the total amount spent during the pandemic on the sector to at least Â£700m. public transport transport hubs, like airports shops and supermarkets shopping centres auction houses premises providing legal or financial services, like banks or post offices personal care and beauty premises, like hair salons and tattoo parlours attractions, like museums and theatres libraries and public reading rooms places of worship funeral service providers community centres and social clubs public areas in hotels and hostels storage and distribution facilities NHS settings such as hospitals People should also wear face coverings at any indoor places not listed but where social distancing may be difficult or you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. shops and supermarkets public transport takeaway restaurants estate agents beauty salons libraries museums aquariums indoor zoos visitor farms any other indoor tourist, heritage or cultural site banks, building societies, credit unions cinemas community centres post offices FEELING LOST?:How to start thinking about the future 'HOMELESS HOTEL':Lockdown life inside emergency accommodation Tighter rules on visors, masks and contacts How to stay cool in a face mask in the heat Where do I still need to wear a mask?

"The photograph - published by Nius - appears to show Juan Carlos arriving in Abu Dhabi on the day he announced he was leaving Spain Spain's former king Juan Carlos has reportedly travelled to the United Arab Emirates after leaving his home country amid a corruption investigation. A photograph published by Spanish media group NIUS appears to show the ex-monarch arriving in Abu Dhabi. Juan Carlos made the shock announcement on Monday that he was leaving Spain. The former king denies any wrongdoing and has said he would be available if prosecutors needed to interview him. His departure has sparked a huge debate in Spain about the monarchy and intense speculation about where the former king has gone. Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Media puzzles over former king's whereabouts Local reports said he had travelled to the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean or to Spain's neighbour, Portugal. But there are now reports Juan Carlos is occupying an entire floor at Abu Dhabi's five-star Emirates Palace hotel. The former king was reportedly close with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. As yet however his location remains unconfirmed. Spain's royal family and government have so far declined to comment on his whereabouts. Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after close to 40 years in power and handed power to his son Felipe. His decision to give up the throne came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. The controversies however did not stop there. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched an investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication. This video can not be played King Juan Carlos, 76, has had health problems in recent years On 3 August Juan Carlos announced he was now leaving his home country in a letter to his son. ""Guided by the conviction to best serve the people of Spain, its institutions, and you as king, I inform you of my decision at this time to leave Spain,"" he wrote. He said he made the decision ""in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating"" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with ""tranquillity"". A statement said King Felipe VI had conveyed ""his heartfelt respect and gratitude"" to his father for this decision. The departure has sparked a fresh debate about the role of the Spanish monarchy and the corruption allegations against Juan Carlos. Catalonia's parliament - which is controlled by separatist parties who seek independence from Spain - voted in a non-binding motion on Friday to condemn the monarchy after the ex-king's departure. ""Neither Spaniards nor Catalans deserve such a loud and ridiculous scandal on an international scale,"" regional president Quim Torra told lawmakers. There have also been demonstrations calling for Spain to become a republic again. The country last removed its monarchy in 1931 before a devastating civil war which ended with the victory of dictator Francisco Franco in 1939.

"More than Â£12.3bn was given to local authorities to pass on to eligible small businesses across England Emergency coronavirus funding for firms will go back to the Treasury at the end of the month if it is not claimed, business leaders have said. Four months after Â£12bn was released to help them through the coronavirus pandemic, Â£1.5bn is unclaimed. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) warned the money was sitting in councils' bank accounts. The government said it was working with councils to reach eligible businesses. The Local Government Association (LGA) said local authorities needed more time and flexibility to ensure businesses benefited from the funding. A month after the schemes launched nearly 500,000 businesses had received a grant Emergency grants for businesses in England were announced on 17 March. Lump sums of Â£10,000, through the Small Business Grant Fund, and Â£25,000 through the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund, were intended to help businesses' cash flows during the coronavirus pandemic. As of 3 August, Â£10.8bn had been paid out to nearly 900,000 businesses, leaving Â£1.5bn yet to reach nearly 80,000 eligible firms by late August,according to official data,external. The figures suggest more than one in five businesses in areas such as Wealden, South Lakeland and South Somerset have not claimed grants. Of the 314 English councils distributing the money, 291 have at least one business entitled to support that has not received it. The figures also suggest there are 24 authorities that paid out more than they were allocated. Westminster City Council paid Â£17m more than it was allocated. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged firms to apply for the grant funding, but added it should not be returned to the government if it was not claimed by the deadline. ""There are many small businesses who aren't eligible, so the government should widen the criteria to those on the periphery,"" he said. He added the money would be a ""Godsend"" for businesses left out by the ""restrictive criteria"" for the grant, such as firms in supply chains to other small ventures. Wirral Council held Â£14.7m of unspent funding as of the end of July. Councillor Ian Lewis said: ""From my discussions with business owners and shopkeepers in Wallasey, some do not realise that this is a grant, not a loan, so it doesn't have to be repaid. Even businesses that were able to stay open are eligible. ""It would be tragic if businesses close or jobs are lost because they do not apply for this money - it's literally sitting in the council's bank waiting to be claimed."" Places like shops, live music venues, gyms or hotels are eligible for grants, and many others Businesses can apply for one of the following funds: For the small businesses grant they must be based in England, occupy property for business use and have been eligible for relief on various rates by 11 March 2020. To access the retail, hospitality and leisure grant the business must be mainly used as a venue for hospitality, retail or leisure. Some charities can also apply. Brent Council in London said it was telling businesses in ""any way we can"" about the grants, as the borough did not want to hand back any of its Â£4.5m remaining funds to the government. Councillor Shama Tatler said it was ""a surprise"" the government was looking to ""end the schemes and demand the money back"", before all eligible businesses had been contacted. ""We now even have a team of officers physically knocking on people's doors and urging them to claim before the deadline,"" she said. Chairman of the LGA's resource board, Richard Watts, said councils had worked hard to set up discretionary schemes to ""help support as many more as possible"". He added: ""The funding has been a lifeline to struggling businesses worried about the future. ""Shutting the discretionary scheme would be a mistake by the government at this time. Councils need more time and flexibility to ensure as many businesses can benefit from this funding. ""The government also needs to commit to redistributing any unspent resources from the original schemes, including any clawed back, to councils to be spent on local efforts to help further support businesses and reboot local economies."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are working with local councils to ensure funds get to as many eligible small business owners as possible. ""Businesses that are eligible but have not yet received grant funding should speak to their local council as soon as possible.""

"Sammie Richardson says a so-called competition on Instagram was a scam to ""get some cash out of us"". When Sammie Richardson saw an Instagram post about winning a week's holiday to Tenerife she tagged a friend to enter and thought little more about it. Then she got an email saying she'd won. ""I was shaking,"" she said. But after the competition organisers started asking for personal details, Ms Richardson discovered it was a scam. She isn't the only person who has nearly been caught out - experts warn there has been a surge in fraudulent prize promotions since lockdown. Crooks are exploiting the fact that more of us are online for longer periods and are trying to trick consumers into revealing sensitive personal information. ""Criminals know people are spending far more time online, and they're capitalising on that,"" said Jeremy Stern, chief executive of PromoVeritas, a company that helps firms run legitimate prize promotions. ""We've seen a significant increase in the number of online scams."" After Ms Richardson was told she'd won the holiday, the organisers asked for her and her partner's passport details. ""I asked them if I could take my kids could on the holiday,"" says Ms Richardson of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, who has three children, aged three, five and 13. ""They said no problem at all, but said it would cost Â£300 for each child, Â£900 in total. I thought it was worth it. ""They asked for my children's passport details but when I told them my children didn't have passports they said no problem at all. ""I had a feeling something was a little weird,"" she said. She checked out the resort where the holiday prize was and discovered it was for adults only, so there was no way her kids could go. So she contacted the travel company supposedly behind the prize only to be told they'd never heard of the competition. ""It was all a big scam to get our details and some cash out of us,"" Ms Richardson said. ""Consumers need to be very careful about the kind of promotions they enter, and the information they give out,"" warned Mr Stern. ""There are lots of great prizes to be won through major brands in your supermarket and online which should cause you no concern at all. ""But the same is not always true for prizes offered through social media such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."" He said that if you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a promotion - such as a prize draw or the opportunity to 'test' a new product - walk away. ""Entering the wrong one could cost you thousands,"" he said. The crooks behind the scams are hoping to trick people into handing over personal information which can be sold on to lots of market companies. This can end up landing people with a lifetime of spam emails or letters. However, in the worst cases, criminals could use the information to try to steal a person's identity, resulting in their bank account being emptied out or using the details for fraudulent purposes. How can you spot a dodgy offer? Mr Stern said promotions on social media or unbranded websites are likely to be suspect if they ask you lots of irrelevant questions. The prize draw is often just a way to pull you in and gather lots of your personal details to sell on. Be wary of offers to 'Be a tester' or 'You could be a mystery shopper' - they're often prize draws under another name. They rarely care for your views, they just want your data. If there are not even basic terms and conditions, such as deadlines to enter, rules and details of how winners will be selected, that's a sign of a suspicious offer. Also, steer clear of promotions that ask you to enter by liking a Facebook page, or a post or that encourages people to tag a page on Facebook, or retweet on Twitter. They are breaking the rules of the platforms, so the promotion is likely to be dodgy, said Mr Stern. Prize draws that want to charge you money to enter or call themselves a ""raffle"" could be breaking the law. In the UK, it's illegal to run a pay-to-enter prize draw without a gaming licence, unless the promoter is a charity. If you are charged for entry, then it must be a competition, a game of skill, and have a reasonably hard question, or a parallel free entry route. If you spot a scam competition or promotion, report it to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud. It will increase the chance of the scammers being caught and stopped.

"Lockdown restrictions were reintroduced in Aberdeen on Wednesday Another 60 confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland, including 39 in the NHS Grampian area. A cluster of linked cases was discovered in Aberdeen last week, leading tolockdown restrictions being reintroduced in the city. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch said 110 cases had been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak, with more expected to be confirmed. Almost 650 ""close contacts"" from the infections are being investigated. The positive cases includetwo players at Aberdeen FC. The players were among a group of eight footballers who visited a bar in the city a week ago. The whole group are now self-isolating. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Mr Leitch told BBC Scotland that the increase of 60 cases was ""not unexpected"" but ""still worries us"". He said it was difficult to be sure how many of the 39 new cases in NHS Grampian were linked to the Aberdeen cluster. ""We know that at 15:30 yesterday we had 110 cases connected to this outbreak,"" he said. ""We allow test and protect to do its work, rather than be constantly sending us hourly updates and that's the way it should be. I would expect a number of those positives to be connected."" Mr Leitch said the Scottish government was working to prevent community transmission outside the Aberdeen outbreak. ""We want to find each of these cases, break the chain, self-isolate the people so that we can get those numbers down again and Grampian can go back to normal - or semi-normal - like the rest of the country,"" he told the BBC. But the clinical director added that the effects of the local lockdown in Aberdeen may not be seen for ""days, even weeks"". Aberdeen has seen a total of 112 new coronavirus cases in the seven days up to 7 August - a rate of 49 infections per 100,000 people. This compares to a rate of 80.6 in Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, which is currently top ofPublic Health England's local authority watchlist,external. NHS Grampian said it was investigating 643 ""close contacts"" from cases in the area. Susan Webb, director of public health for NHS Grampian, said: ""There has been a substantial rise in the number of close contacts which is not entirely unexpected. ""We speak to detected cases more than once, as we know they will recall different details as they reflect on what they have been doing and where, and who they have met."" Ms Webb said people who developed any of the recognised symptoms of Covid-19 should isolate at home and arrange a test. A picture taken at the weekend showed people queuing outside the Soul bar in Aberdeen On Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""unacceptable"" the Aberdeen footballers had gone to the Soul Bar last Saturday. Images were shared on social media showing queues of people gathered outside the bar, which is one of about 30 venues now linked to the cluster. The players concerned have nowreleased a statement apologising for their actions, saying they never ""could have foreseen the escalation of Covid-19 cases in the Grampian area"". They also deny deliberately attempting to ""flaunt or disobey government guidelines"". ""As a player group, we once again apologise unreservedly to the fans, the manager, the board and all the staff at the club,"" the statement adds. The lockdown restrictions which have been reintroduced for the city's 228,000 residents include: not to travel more than five miles for leisure or holidays not to travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you live in Aberdeenshire if you are currently visiting the city, you can stay - but take necessary precautions when returning home no indoor visits with other households bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs must close, although takeaways can remain open.

"Swansea was the location for one of the demos in Wales by nurses and other NHS staff Hundreds of nurses and NHS staff in Wales are protesting at being excluded from a recent pay rise announcement. Grassroot NHS workers are angry after they were left out of plans to give almost a million public sector workers an above-inflation increase. Marches on Saturday morning in Cardiff, Swansea, Merthyr and Bridgend are part of a UK-wide protest. Ministers said they were working with unions to ensure the ""best possible"" pay package for all health workers. One nurse said: ""To be ignored felt like a kick in the teeth after what we've been through during the pandemic."" Almost 900,000public sector workers have been given an above-inflation pay rise, including doctors, dentists and police. However nurses and junior doctors were not included because they agreed aseparate three-year dealin 2018. They have been told they were already covered by a separate three-year deal struck in 2018 ""We're not saying other people don't deserve a rise - but so do we,"" said Naomi Jenkins, 29, a staff nurse from Swansea. ""We've worked so hard and been through so much during this crisis, and we still are because Covid hasn't gone away. ""It has been such a scary time for all NHS staff - I even wrote a will in case anything happened to me. ""Each day I came home in tears, worrying I might bring the virus back home to my little girl. Some of my colleagues didn't see their children for weeks, but none of us failed to go to work. A crowd of protesters also gathered outside the Senedd in Cardiff Bay ""It was my job to help people, that's what I was made to do and I wanted to do, but I was putting myself and my family at risk - and still am. ""So for the government to exclude us from a pay rise is awful - a real kick in the teeth."" Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died PM joins nationwide clap on NHS 72nd anniversary What are key workers paid? The 2018 deal covered the three years up to April 2021. But unions want the UK and Welsh governments to bring it forward to this year to show its appreciation for the response of NHS staff to the pandemic. The current agreement is said this year to have seen the average nurse receiving an average increase of 4.4%. However, nurses in the higher bracket of their pay grade said the rise is worth ""pennies"" each month. ""It's not just about what happened during the pandemic, we've been chronically underfunded for years,""  said clinical nurse specialist Amy Mainwaring, who has organised the Cardiff march. ""I saw an advert for a litter picker job in London offering a higher salary than me and yet there are nurses who are having to access food banks. It's so wrong."" She said 540 NHS staff died from coronavirus and many nurses ""have lost colleagues"". ""So when we're ignored from the pay rise, nurses and staff felt it was time to stop standing quietly by. I just hope ministers are listening,"" she added. ""Nurses making life and death decisions are paid less than supermarket managers"", said Amy Mainwaring Hundreds of people, mostly NHS staff, are at the four marches in Wales. They are outside the Senedd in Cardiff Bay, from Castle Gardens to the Guildhall in Swansea, at Merthyr Tydfil fountain and outside the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. Staff are hoping they can count on support from the public who regularly turned out to clap for the NHS during lockdown. Unison saida survey showed 69% of the public,externalthink all NHS staff should get an early pay rise before the end of this year, in light of coronavirus. ""The public support we had with the clapping during lockdown was so amazing. It genuinely lifted all our spirits at a very difficult and emotional time,"" said Ms Jenkins. An online petition calling for all frontline NHS workers to have an ""adequate pay rise"" has so far been signed more than 116,000 times. Nurse Meg Wood said: ""Compared with cost of living increases since 2010, we are still earning less than we were ten years ago in real terms. This video can not be played ""This is where the NHS started"" ""Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak clapped for carers, but don't think we deserve a pay rise. What a joke."" The Welsh Government said a new deal for NHS staff in Wales would be agreed through an independent public pay review. It said it recognised the ""incredible work"" done by NHS workers every day and was working with unions to ensure the ""best possible"" pay package for all health workers. A spokesperson added: ""We remain committed to tackling poverty in Wales which is why earlier this year the health minister announced funding to top-up the pay of those Agenda for Change staff on the lower pay points to bring their pay in line with the Living Wage Foundation's independent recommended real-wage rate from April 2020.""

"Sammie Richardson says a so-called competition on Instagram was a scam to ""get some cash out of us"". When Sammie Richardson saw an Instagram post about winning a week's holiday to Tenerife she tagged a friend to enter and thought little more about it. Then she got an email saying she'd won. ""I was shaking,"" she said. But after the competition organisers started asking for personal details, Ms Richardson discovered it was a scam. She isn't the only person who has nearly been caught out - experts warn there has been a surge in fraudulent prize promotions since lockdown. Crooks are exploiting the fact that more of us are online for longer periods and are trying to trick consumers into revealing sensitive personal information. ""Criminals know people are spending far more time online, and they're capitalising on that,"" said Jeremy Stern, chief executive of PromoVeritas, a company that helps firms run legitimate prize promotions. ""We've seen a significant increase in the number of online scams."" After Ms Richardson was told she'd won the holiday, the organisers asked for her and her partner's passport details. ""I asked them if I could take my kids could on the holiday,"" says Ms Richardson of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, who has three children, aged three, five and 13. ""They said no problem at all, but said it would cost Â£300 for each child, Â£900 in total. I thought it was worth it. ""They asked for my children's passport details but when I told them my children didn't have passports they said no problem at all. ""I had a feeling something was a little weird,"" she said. She checked out the resort where the holiday prize was and discovered it was for adults only, so there was no way her kids could go. So she contacted the travel company supposedly behind the prize only to be told they'd never heard of the competition. ""It was all a big scam to get our details and some cash out of us,"" Ms Richardson said. ""Consumers need to be very careful about the kind of promotions they enter, and the information they give out,"" warned Mr Stern. ""There are lots of great prizes to be won through major brands in your supermarket and online which should cause you no concern at all. ""But the same is not always true for prizes offered through social media such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."" He said that if you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a promotion - such as a prize draw or the opportunity to 'test' a new product - walk away. ""Entering the wrong one could cost you thousands,"" he said. The crooks behind the scams are hoping to trick people into handing over personal information which can be sold on to lots of market companies. This can end up landing people with a lifetime of spam emails or letters. However, in the worst cases, criminals could use the information to try to steal a person's identity, resulting in their bank account being emptied out or using the details for fraudulent purposes. How can you spot a dodgy offer? Mr Stern said promotions on social media or unbranded websites are likely to be suspect if they ask you lots of irrelevant questions. The prize draw is often just a way to pull you in and gather lots of your personal details to sell on. Be wary of offers to 'Be a tester' or 'You could be a mystery shopper' - they're often prize draws under another name. They rarely care for your views, they just want your data. If there are not even basic terms and conditions, such as deadlines to enter, rules and details of how winners will be selected, that's a sign of a suspicious offer. Also, steer clear of promotions that ask you to enter by liking a Facebook page, or a post or that encourages people to tag a page on Facebook, or retweet on Twitter. They are breaking the rules of the platforms, so the promotion is likely to be dodgy, said Mr Stern. Prize draws that want to charge you money to enter or call themselves a ""raffle"" could be breaking the law. In the UK, it's illegal to run a pay-to-enter prize draw without a gaming licence, unless the promoter is a charity. If you are charged for entry, then it must be a competition, a game of skill, and have a reasonably hard question, or a parallel free entry route. If you spot a scam competition or promotion, report it to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud. It will increase the chance of the scammers being caught and stopped.

"Mark Meadows (left) and Steven Mnuchin represent the White House in the talks Last-ditch negotiations at the US Congress to forge another stimulus package for the coronavirus-ravaged economy have collapsed in stalemate. Democrats and Republicans remain at odds over everything from unemployment benefits to financial aid for schools to cash injections for states' coffers. The US unemployment rate stands at 10.2%, higher than any level during the 2008 financial crisis. Jobless benefits have expired, as has a federal moratorium on evictions. The failure to reach a deal will disappoint tens of millions of unemployed Americans who had been receiving an extra $600 (Â£450) a week on top of normal unemployment benefits during the pandemic. That payment expired last month and Republicans want to reduce it. On Friday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful elected Democrat, held a meeting in her Capitol Hill office with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Mrs Pelosi said in a news conference that she was willing to offer a trillion-dollar compromise on a $3.5tn (Â£2.7tn) stimulus bill passed by her Democratic-controlled chamber but rejected by the Republican-held Senate. US jobs growth slows in July as pandemic takes toll US economy suffers sharpest contraction in decades ""We'll go down one trillion, you go up one trillion,"" she told reporters as she staked out her position, adding: ""We have a moral responsibility to find common ground."" As he entered Mrs Pelosi's office on Friday, Mr Mnuchin called her proposal ""a non-starter"". Republicans prefer a package closer to $1tn total and want any deal to include legal protections for employers against virus-related health claims from workers. They also want far less aid to local governments than Democrats are seeking. Why US is expecting an 'avalanche' of evictions The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' In a surprise news conference on Friday evening from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is spending the weekend, President Trump blamed Democratic congressional leaders for the impasse. ""Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left-wing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus,"" he said. He added: ""If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need."" This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied Mr Trump said he may seek to defer the payroll tax, unemployment benefits and student loan interest until the end of the year, as well as extending the eviction moratorium. The White House has previously suggested the president would take unilateral action through executive order. But it is unclear how much he can change by fiat, given that Congress controls federal spending. After weeks of negotiations, during which federal unemployment support for millions of Americans ended and economic numbers indicated the recovery was stalling, congressional Democrats and administration officials were able to offer the nation... nothing. Both sides agreed that something had to be done to help the unemployed, provide some support to schools that are struggling to cope with the pandemic and protect those facing eviction. The challenge was there was still at least a trillion dollars in daylight between their two plans, and neither side seemed willing to budge. That suggests that both sides are willing to endure the political and economic fallout of a continued impasse. Democrats may believe that Americans will blame the president or recalcitrant Senate Republicans who have shown little interest in more deficit spending. The White House may hope that whatever unilateral actions Donald Trump can take will offer him some political protections. The bottom line, however, is that millions of Americans will teeter closer to the edge of the financial abyss - and with Congress leaving town for summer recess, there's little sign of substantive help from Washington anytime soon. The US unemployment rate continued to fall in July in the US, but it was a much lower decrease than in May and June, denting hopes of an economic revival. Negotiations have been going on for the past two weeks, as the US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpasses 160,000. The US has far more Covid-19 cases by volume than any other country - more than 4.9 million - and its rate of infection has risen steadily throughout the summer. Congress has already allocated some $3tn for pandemic relief so far. Some Republicans in Congress do not wish to spend any more. Nearly half of Republican senators say they would oppose any new relief bill at all. Following the 90-minute meeting, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters it was ""disappointing"". ""We're asking them again to be fair, to meet us in the middle, not to have a 'my way or the highway attitude,' which they seem to have.""

England all-rounder Chris Woakes at the presentation:""We felt that [attacking] was the way to go on that surface. The match situation made our minds for us. It was good idea to take them on and put them under pressure. I was playing second fiddle at one point. I was devastated Jos got out but it was a great partnership.

""That's why Jos Buttler is in this team. It shows his strength of character, strength of mind, being able to read those situations. I think this could be a real stepping stone in his career.

catch knows itâs the worst feeling in Test cricket. âI found it tough and hard to shut out. If I am going to continue
to be a wicketkeeper in this team, I'm going to have to be better. âI'm honest enough to know I have
to be better.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

"Lockdown restrictions were reintroduced in Aberdeen on Wednesday Another 60 confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland, including 39 in the NHS Grampian area. A cluster of linked cases was discovered in Aberdeen last week, leading tolockdown restrictions being reintroduced in the city. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch said 110 cases had been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak, with more expected to be confirmed. Almost 650 ""close contacts"" from the infections are being investigated. The positive cases includetwo players at Aberdeen FC. The players were among a group of eight footballers who visited a bar in the city a week ago. The whole group are now self-isolating. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Mr Leitch told BBC Scotland that the increase of 60 cases was ""not unexpected"" but ""still worries us"". He said it was difficult to be sure how many of the 39 new cases in NHS Grampian were linked to the Aberdeen cluster. ""We know that at 15:30 yesterday we had 110 cases connected to this outbreak,"" he said. ""We allow test and protect to do its work, rather than be constantly sending us hourly updates and that's the way it should be. I would expect a number of those positives to be connected."" Mr Leitch said the Scottish government was working to prevent community transmission outside the Aberdeen outbreak. ""We want to find each of these cases, break the chain, self-isolate the people so that we can get those numbers down again and Grampian can go back to normal - or semi-normal - like the rest of the country,"" he told the BBC. But the clinical director added that the effects of the local lockdown in Aberdeen may not be seen for ""days, even weeks"". Aberdeen has seen a total of 112 new coronavirus cases in the seven days up to 7 August - a rate of 49 infections per 100,000 people. This compares to a rate of 80.6 in Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, which is currently top ofPublic Health England's local authority watchlist,external. NHS Grampian said it was investigating 643 ""close contacts"" from cases in the area. Susan Webb, director of public health for NHS Grampian, said: ""There has been a substantial rise in the number of close contacts which is not entirely unexpected. ""We speak to detected cases more than once, as we know they will recall different details as they reflect on what they have been doing and where, and who they have met.""

Tune in if you can. We'll be back on Thursday for the second Test. I cannot wait! That Buttler-Woakes partnership should be remembered for a very long time. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special The manner in which they've won this game, on an awkward surface, is truly remarkable. England all-rounder Chris Woakes at the presentation:""We felt that [attacking] was the way to go on that surface. The match situation made our minds for us. It was good idea to take them on and put them under pressure. I was playing second fiddle at one point. I was devastated Jos got out but it was a great partnership. ""He is one of the best white-ball players in the world - one of best run-chasers - and he showed why today. He put them under pressure. I couldn't have picked a better partner at the other end."" England captain Joe Root speaking on TMS:""What a fantastic day's cricket. I couldn't be more proud of the team. They showed immense character. That partnership was breathtaking. It had it all. ""That's why Jos Buttler is in this team. It shows his strength of character, strength of mind, being able to read those situations. I think this could be a real stepping stone in his career. ""When you play poorly and still find a away to win a game as a great train, shows a great deal about that team. ""So many parts of this game, we were behind. We were up against it but we found a way and that's a sign of a good team with clarity."" More from
Buttler on his wicketkeeping errors:âIf I take those chances, we're not
chasing 270 odd. I know it's not good enough as an international wicketkeeper
and I have to perform at a level accustomed to international cricket. I know I didnât
keep well enough. As a wicketkeeper there is nowhere to hide. Anyone who drops a
catch knows itâs the worst feeling in Test cricket. âI found it tough and hard to shut out. If I am going to continue
to be a wicketkeeper in this team, I'm going to have to be better. âI'm honest enough to know I have
to be better.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

a lot of character and determination from the boys to get over the line. ""Woakes was
outstanding, walking off not out and winning the game. ""When we saw that ball to Ollie Pope it made us feel like we have
to score runs, change the momentum and sort of score four an over and take us
to the target before the second new ball. It
was a brute of a delivery, it was very nasty. It caught him nastily on the
wrist, hope he's OK. ""As
soon as the game becomes more winnable, the pressure comes on and the
expectation of getting there. I think Pakistan started bowling well towards the
end, but I am just delighted and relieved."" England captain Joe Root at the presentation:""[Where does that win rank?] Up there. It was a brilliant chase. I couldn't be more proud of the lads. The way we approached the day was outstanding and that partnership with Woakesy and Jos was magnificent. I am thrilled to bits to be stood here having won the game.

It was a very special partnership, it was turning and even for the fast bowler it was jumping up from a length. So credit to them, they outplayed us in that period. Maybe we were too late to bring fielders up. ""It's disappointing but not over yet, there are still two Tests to go. There a lot of positives from this game, we outplayed England on most parts of this Test match. We lost a couple of sessions and we lost them badly.""

What confidence that win will give the young England players in that dressing room. England looked finished when they lost 4-31 in the afternoon session. Some comeback. Jos Buttler speaking to Sky Sports:""We tried to grab initiative. It felt like we had to stay in and bat the time. We wanted to be positive and put pressure back on Pakistan and try to replicate a one-day chase."" Azhar MahmoodFormer Pakistan all-rounder on Test Match Special Extraordinary game of cricket. I must give credit to England. It was tough when Woakes and Buttler came. It was a brilliant effort from the bowlers but the thing that cost Pakistan was the captaincy.

"Sammie Richardson says a so-called competition on Instagram was a scam to ""get some cash out of us"". When Sammie Richardson saw an Instagram post about winning a week's holiday to Tenerife she tagged a friend to enter and thought little more about it. Then she got an email saying she'd won. ""I was shaking,"" she said. But after the competition organisers started asking for personal details, Ms Richardson discovered it was a scam. She isn't the only person who has nearly been caught out - experts warn there has been a surge in fraudulent prize promotions since lockdown. Crooks are exploiting the fact that more of us are online for longer periods and are trying to trick consumers into revealing sensitive personal information. ""Criminals know people are spending far more time online, and they're capitalising on that,"" said Jeremy Stern, chief executive of PromoVeritas, a company that helps firms run legitimate prize promotions. ""We've seen a significant increase in the number of online scams."" After Ms Richardson was told she'd won the holiday, the organisers asked for her and her partner's passport details. ""I asked them if I could take my kids could on the holiday,"" says Ms Richardson of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, who has three children, aged three, five and 13. ""They said no problem at all, but said it would cost Â£300 for each child, Â£900 in total. I thought it was worth it. ""They asked for my children's passport details but when I told them my children didn't have passports they said no problem at all. ""I had a feeling something was a little weird,"" she said. She checked out the resort where the holiday prize was and discovered it was for adults only, so there was no way her kids could go. So she contacted the travel company supposedly behind the prize only to be told they'd never heard of the competition. ""It was all a big scam to get our details and some cash out of us,"" Ms Richardson said. ""Consumers need to be very careful about the kind of promotions they enter, and the information they give out,"" warned Mr Stern. ""There are lots of great prizes to be won through major brands in your supermarket and online which should cause you no concern at all. ""But the same is not always true for prizes offered through social media such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."" He said that if you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a promotion - such as a prize draw or the opportunity to 'test' a new product - walk away. ""Entering the wrong one could cost you thousands,"" he said. The crooks behind the scams are hoping to trick people into handing over personal information which can be sold on to lots of market companies. This can end up landing people with a lifetime of spam emails or letters. However, in the worst cases, criminals could use the information to try to steal a person's identity, resulting in their bank account being emptied out or using the details for fraudulent purposes. How can you spot a dodgy offer? Mr Stern said promotions on social media or unbranded websites are likely to be suspect if they ask you lots of irrelevant questions. The prize draw is often just a way to pull you in and gather lots of your personal details to sell on. Be wary of offers to 'Be a tester' or 'You could be a mystery shopper' - they're often prize draws under another name. They rarely care for your views, they just want your data. If there are not even basic terms and conditions, such as deadlines to enter, rules and details of how winners will be selected, that's a sign of a suspicious offer. Also, steer clear of promotions that ask you to enter by liking a Facebook page, or a post or that encourages people to tag a page on Facebook, or retweet on Twitter. They are breaking the rules of the platforms, so the promotion is likely to be dodgy, said Mr Stern. Prize draws that want to charge you money to enter or call themselves a ""raffle"" could be breaking the law. In the UK, it's illegal to run a pay-to-enter prize draw without a gaming licence, unless the promoter is a charity. If you are charged for entry, then it must be a competition, a game of skill, and have a reasonably hard question, or a parallel free entry route. If you spot a scam competition or promotion, report it to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud. It will increase the chance of the scammers being caught and stopped.

"Lebanon is in the throes of its worst crisis for many years The Lebanese government has resigned amid growing public anger following a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August that killed at least 200 people and injured about 5,000 others. The blast came at a difficult time for Lebanon, which is not only trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus but is also mired in an unprecedented economic crisis. The economic situation has pushed tens of thousands people into poverty and triggered large anti-government protests. Announcing the move on Monday, outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab said his government was taking ""a step back... to stand with the people, in order to wage the battle of change with them"". Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the then government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation continued to worsen and last week's deadly explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. People have taken to the streets again, and there have been clashes between protesters and police. The government's plans to investigate the cause of the explosion were not enough for most people, who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption. In his strongly worded speech on Monday, Mr Diab blamed ""a system of corruption... deeply-rooted in all the functions of the state"". ""One of the many examples of corruption exploded in the port of Beirut, and the calamity befell Lebanon,"" he said. ""But corruption cases are widespread in the country's political and administrative landscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which pose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the country."" Even before the coronavirus pandemic at the start of this year, Lebanon seemed to be headed for a crash. Its public debt-to-gross domestic product (what a country owes compared to what it produces) was the third highest in the world; unemployment stood at 25%; and nearly a third of the population was living below the poverty line. The Lebanese pound has lost about 80% of its value over the past 10 months Late last year also saw the unravelling ofwhat analysts said was effectively a state-sponsored pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme,externalrun by the central bank, which was borrowing from commercial banks at above-market interest rates to pay back its debts and maintain the Lebanese pound's fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. At the same time, people were getting increasingly angry and frustrated about the government's failure to provide even basic services. They were having to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water, limited public healthcare, and some of the world's worst internet connections. 'Now there is nothing' - Lebanon pushed to brink How did Lebanon get into such a deep crisis? How Lebanon became the third most indebted nation Many blamed the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. At the start of October 2019, a shortage of foreign currency led to the Lebanese pound losing value against the dollar on a newly emerged black market for the first time in two decades. When importers of wheat and fuel demanded to be paid in dollars, unions called strikes. Then, unprecedented wildfires in the country's western mountains highlighted how underfunded and underequipped the fire service was. Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister in response to the protests In mid-October, the government proposed new taxes on tobacco, petrol, andvoice calls via messaging services such as WhatsAppto drum up more revenue, but a backlash forced it to cancel the plans. However, the debacle unleashed a surge of discontent that had been simmering in Lebanon for years. Tens of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets, leading to the resignation of Western-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his unity government. The protests have cut across sectarian lines and involved people from all sections of society Protests cut across sectarian lines - a rare phenomenon since the country's devastating 1975-1989 civil war ended - and brought the country to a virtual standstill. Newly appointed Prime Minister Hassan Diab subsequently announced that Lebanon would default on its foreign debt for the first time in its history, saying its foreign currency reserves had hit a ""critical and dangerous"" level and that those remaining were needed to pay for vital imports. In the wake of the first Covid-19 deaths and a surge in infections, a lockdown was imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the disease. On the one hand, it forced anti-government protesters off the streets, but on the other, it made the economic crisis much worse and exposed the inadequacies of Lebanon's social welfare system. The prime minister has warned that Lebanon is at ""risk of a major food crisis"" Many business were forced to lay off staff or put them on furlough without pay; the gap between the Lebanese pound's value on the official and black-market exchange rates widened; and banks tightened capital controls. As prices rose further, many families were unable to buy even basic necessities. Growing economic hardship triggered fresh unrest. In Aprila young man was shot dead by soldiers during a violent protest in Tripoliand several banks were set ablaze. The government, meanwhile, finally approved a recovery plan that it hoped would end the economic crisis and win support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package worth $10bn. Banks have been attacked and set on fire by protesters By the time the coronavirus restrictions began to be lifted in May, the prices of some foodstuffs had doubled and Mr Diab warned that Lebanon was at risk of a ""major food crisis"". ""Many Lebanese have already stopped buying meat, fruits and vegetables, and may soon find it difficult to afford even bread,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. Most analysts point to one key factor: political sectarianism, or groups looking after their own interests. Lebanon officially recognises 18 religious communities - four Muslim, 12 Christian, the Druze sect and Judaism. The three main political offices - president, speaker of parliament and prime minister - are divided among the three biggest communities (Maronite Christian; Shia Muslim; and Sunni Muslim, respectively) under an agreement dating back to 1943. Parliament's 128 seats are also divided evenly between Christians and Muslims (including Druze). The seats in parliament are divided between religious communities It is this religious diversity that makes the country an easy target for interference by external powers, as seen with Iran's backing of the Shia Hezbollah movement, widely seen as the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon Since the end of the civil war, political leaders from each sect have maintained their power and influence through a system of patronage networks - protecting the interests of the religious communities they represent, and offering - both legal and illegal - financial incentives. Lebanon ranked 137th out of 180 countries,external(180 being the worst) on Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. The watchdog says corruption ""permeates all levels of society"" in Lebanon, with political parties, parliament and the police perceived as ""the most corrupt institutions of the country"". It says it is the very system of sectarian power-sharing which is fuelling these patronage networks and hindering Lebanon's system of governance.

"James Nash was described as a ""kind-hearted individual and a proactive parish councillor"" A ""kind-hearted"" children's author and parish councillor shot at his home in Hampshire has died. James Nash suffered serious head injuries in the attack at Upper Enham, near Andover, on Wednesday afternoon. The suspect, a 34-year-old man, died in a police chase after trying to flee on a motorcycle. Hampshire Constabulary confirmed Mr Nash died in hospital in the early hours and the investigation was being treated as murder. A 40-year-old woman was also assaulted during the attack and suffered minor injuries. According to theAndover Advertiser,external, Mr Nash's mother Gillian Nash said: ""Very sadly I have to tell you that James Nash died of his brutal injuries today. ""His father, his sister and I are in a total state of shock and grief. ""We have lost a beautiful, talented son and brother and I know all who knew him would say he was the kindest, most caring person."" Mr Nash was shot in MacCallum Road in Upper Enham Tributes have been sent from friends and colleagues of the writer and parish councillor, who represented the village of Enham Alamein. Piet van Drunick from Andover was close friends with Mr Nash. He said: ""James was the kindest man ever. ""He was always there for everyone. He loved life and was so knowledgeable about so many things, he was clever in every way. ""My tears have not stopped since I heard this terrible news. He was with my sister and brother-in-law just before this all happened. My heart goes out to his wife and family."" Mr Nash gave a reading of his children's book in a Sherborne bookshop three years ago Phil North, leader of Test Valley Borough Council, posted on Facebook: ""This is such devastating news, not just for his family and friends who will obviously miss him terribly, but for the whole community of Enham Alamein where he was a public representative. ""He was such a kind-hearted individual and a proactive parish councillor who cared deeply for his community."" He added: ""As a talented children's author and illustrator, I was extremely touched last year when one of the dedications in his latest book was to my newborn daughter, Eleanor-Ivy Mae. ""We will always treasure our copy."" Claire Porter from Chapter House Books, in Sherborne, Dorset, where Mr Nash went to school, said he would always pop in when visiting family. She said: ""He was a really nice guy who was brave enough to follow his dream of being a professional artist, then children's author after a successful career in the aerospace industry. ""He was so proud when he published his first book Winter Wild in 2016 and then came into the shop to give a reading in December 2017. "" Mr Nash had left his career in the aerospace industry to pursue his dream of becoming a professional artist The Test Valley Arts Foundation said Mr Nash worked with its artists on many occasions and said his death was a ""huge loss"". The foundation's statement read: ""James was a talented artist and writer. He was charming, soft spoken and completely genuine. He captivated the audiences he worked with and young people adored him. ""His passion was wild life, the natural world and the community of the Test Valley which came through in almost everything he did."" Mr Nash's local newspaper, the Andover Advertiser, haspaid tribute,externalto him by looking back at his life and achievements in a series of tweets.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We take this action with a heavy heart"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are now facing new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules impact people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. The health secretary told the BBC the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Labour criticised the timing of the announcement - late on Thursday night. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing, which he said showed that ""most of the transmission is happening between households visiting each other, and people visiting relatives and friends"". Pubs and restaurants to reopen in Leicester Luxembourg taken off UK travel exemption list What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. There is an inescapable fact here - the coronavirus has not gone away and it still thrives on close human contact. The more we come together the easier it will spread. We have seen this happen as national lockdowns have been lifted from Europe, to the US, to Australia and more. Better testing means we can now spot where cases are starting to spike. The warning signs are in the data with cases climbing in areas like Manchester, Trafford, Salford and Tameside. The hope is the government has acted quickly enough to suppress the virus with ""local restrictions"" before it becomes a national problem. It is now the turn of millions of people in northern England to take the hit, but these local lockdown-tightening measures could happen anywhere. This is the ""new normal"" as we buy time until a vaccine is developed. The health secretary said the move was not an attempt to curtail Eid celebrations after Miqdaad Versi, from the Muslim Council of Britain, said the restrictions were likely to have a ""large impact"" on Muslim families celebrating Eid. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop the celebrations from taking place, Mr Hancock said: ""No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are."" Also on the Today programme, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham suggested that the rise in transmission had been caused in part by gatherings ""in multi-generational households"". Asked whether he meant predominantly the Asian population of Greater Manchester, Mr Burnham replied: ""Yes, I do mean that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, while welcoming the measures, condemned the government's decision to announce the changeson Twitter just after 21:00 BST,externalon Thursday as ""a new low for the government's communications during this crisis"". This video can not be played After Matt Hancock appeared to contradict the new rules, Andy Burnham said it was up to the government to clear up the confusion The government published details of the new restrictions two hours after the health secretary tweeted the announcement, and then releasedfurther guidance on the changes,externalon Friday morning. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules. The latest announcement in detail: People in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester cannot mix with other households (apart from those in their support bubbles) in private homes or gardens People in those areas can only go to pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues with other members of their household From Monday in Leicester, restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers can open but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed Cinemas and museums will also be able to open in Leicester from Monday and religious ceremonies will be able to take place The borough of Oadby and Wigston on the outskirts of Leicester is taken out of local lockdown Also, gyms and leisure centres will remain closed in Blackburn, but they will be able to reopen in Luton -both towns saw the lifting of restrictions paused last week SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Some local Conservative MPs questioned the government's decision to apply the measures to the whole of Greater Manchester, which includes 10 local authority areas - Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport,tweeted,externalthat Greater Manchester was ""not one homogeneous area"" and treating all 10 boroughs the same was ""not the right approach"". The government always warned it would slam on the brakes if it had to. Now it has - on an unprecedented scale, with two-and-a-half hours notice. Liberties recently returned, almost instantly snatched away. And snatched with a rebuke from the health secretary for England - Matt Hancock - who repeatedly said this was necessary because some in the areas affected had failed to stick to social distancing rules. I'm told the change comes without a time limit, but will be reviewed every week. And don't be surprised if the government, from the prime minister down, make the case that this could happen elsewhere too if people are cavalier about the rules. And yet, in Leicester, the local, more severe restrictions imposed there are to be eased. The baby steps back towards normality are going to be hesitant and faltering; messy in their detail and messy in their geography. The virus has robbed us of many things. It continues to rob us of any certainty. The current rules for the rest of England allow two households - up to a maximum of 30 people - to meet indoors. In Wales, indoor meetings between different households are still not allowed, but two households of any size can join up in an ""extended household"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to 10 people from four different households can meet indoors, while in Scotland, up to eight people from three different households can meet indoors. On Thursday, a further 38 people in the UK died, bringing the total number of Covid-19 associated deaths to 45,999. And 846 cases were reported - the highest number of cases in a day for a month.

"Much of the UK is set to enjoy hot weather over the weekend. But what are you allowed to do while following the latest coronavirus guidelines? Yes, people are now allowed to meet up outdoors across the UK. However, social distancing guidelines are still in place. These include limits on the number of people in a group - the details of which vary. For example, in England the guidelines say you can can meet six people from multiple households outdoors, or up to 30 people from two households. In Scotland, the limit is 15 people from up to five households. Although people will be meeting up outdoors, you should still think about how far apart you keep. That means one metre plus where 2m (6ft) is not possible in England, 2m in Scotland and Wales, 1m with restrictions in Northern Ireland. So, with that in mind, you can get together for a chat, a picnic, or to play sport. However, if a particular place becomes too crowded, it is possible visitors could be turned away. In England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has anexceptional new power to completely close a specific public place. And he has also given local councils a suite of new powers to close down premises, stop events and shut down places like parks. This could be used to close beaches or beauty spots if there are concerns about crowds potentially spreading the virus. How to stay cool in a face mask as hot UK weather forecast Hot weather: How to sleep in the heat Dr Julian Tang, an expert in respiratory sciences from the University of Leicester, said that while the risk is lower when meeting people outside, there are things to bear in mind. He said: ""If you are within 50 to 70cm you are at what I call garlic breath distance - if you can smell what they've been eating then you're almost certainly breathing their air. ""If you're on a really crowded beach where people are less than 1m apart, then the sun and wind may not have time to kill or blow away the virus before it is inhaled by the other person."" He also suggests if you're talking to a friend on the beach, it's better to both be looking out to sea rather than facing each other. You can now take part in plenty of other activities outdoors, including: Usingoutdoor gyms and swimming poolsin England Playing sports such as tennis, golf and cricket Visiting theme parks and funfairs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Funfairs in Scotlandwill be closed until at least 24 August Go to an outdoor theatre Unless youare affected by a local lockdown,you can entertain guests at home this weekend. If you are serving food, or having a barbecue, experts recommend precautions such as: Put food straight on plates and don't use large serving bowls Avoid serving cold food which needs ""handling"", like cold meats or salads Use detergent or soapy water to regularly wipe down places people touch regularly Wash hands frequently Eating outdoors is recommended, but if you eat indoors try to keep windows and doors open for ventilation. Numbers of people allowed in houses and private gardensin England, Scotland and Northern Ireland differ,while indoor meetings are not allowed in Wales. If you want to go and sit in a beer garden, or on a restaurant terrace, you can, as pubs, restaurants and cafes across the UKare now open again. Guidance has been issued inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Irelandon measures they need to take to keep customers and staff safe. You should expect to: Book ahead Give contact details Follow a one-way system Be offered table service Businesses have been asked to try to: Monitor crowd density, and cut the number of people in enclosed spaces Improve ventilation Changing shift patterns so staff work in set teams Going away this weekend with members of your own household, on your own, or with friends, is possible. Again, social distancing guidelines should be followed and the number of people who can make the tripdiffers across the UK. For example, in England, two households of any size can meet up indoors - and this can be in shared accommodation away from home. In Wales, overnight stays are only permitted where two households have formed an ""extended household"". Holidaymakers are advised to ""take particular care to maintain excellent hygiene - washing hands and surfaces - and avoid using shared facilities like bathrooms wherever possible"". You are also advised not to share private swimming pools, paddling pools or any sort of garden equipment with anyone outside your own household or support bubble.
