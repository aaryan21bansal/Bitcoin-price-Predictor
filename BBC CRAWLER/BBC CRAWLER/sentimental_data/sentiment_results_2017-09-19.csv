"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake?

""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican It is feared the death toll will rise further The Mexican government earlier issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

"This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? US President Donald Trump has told the UN General Assembly that America would destroy North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. In his debut speech, he mocked North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" North Korea has tested nuclear bombs and missiles in defiance of the UN. Just before Mr Trump spoke, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had urged statesmanship, saying: ""We must not sleepwalk our way into war."" The American leader also attacked Iran, saying it was a ""corrupt dictatorship"" intent on destabilising the Middle East. This video can not be played Trump's UN audience agrees on one thing about his speech He called on the government in Tehran to cease supporting terrorism and again criticised the Obama-era international agreement over Iran's nuclear programme, which he called an embarrassment. In his own debut speech, French President Emmanuel Macron strongly defended the Paris climate accord, signed in the same room in New York two years ago and rejected in June by Mr Trump, towidespread international dismay. TheGeneral Assembly,external, which continues until Monday, is an annual event, bringing together leaders of the UN's 193 member states. Key messages from Trump's speech Reality Check: Has UN staffing doubled since 2000? In other parts of Mr Trump's speech he: said the US could ""no longer be taken advantage of or enter one-sided deals"" said the crisis in Venezuela, which is led by a leftwing government hostile to the US, was ""unacceptable"" and America could not ""stand by and watch"" denounced socialism as an ideology, saying it had only brought ""anguish and devastation and failure"" condemned ""uncontrolled migration"" but insisted America was a ""compassionate nation"" which had spent billions of dollars on helping refugees return to their home countries Washington has repeatedly warned North Korea over its weapons tests, which violate UN Security Council resolutions. The crisis worsened last month whenthe North announced plans to test missiles around the US Pacific territory of Guam. Kim Jong-un watched a recent missile test in person ""If [the US] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump's threat to ""totally destroy"" North Korea is implausible, according to Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' ""I think the folks in the Pentagon when they look at military options are just aghast at the potential loss of life that could occur with at a minimum hundreds of thousands of South Koreans killed in Seoul,"" he told the BBC. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? President Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his ""America First"" doctrine but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. In contrast to the focus on globalisation that has driven so much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s, Mr Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system. There was a nod to the old axis of evil theme. He opposed ""the righteous many"" to ""the wicked few"", with his rogues' gallery taking in a predictable cast of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. Nonetheless Mr Trump's world view contained many contradictions. Where exactly is the boundary between national sovereignty and collective action? And does America's newfound foreign policy pragmatism extend just to calling for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela or actually for doing something practical about it? The 2015deal between Iran, the US and other world powers, including China and Russia, was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. ""Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it,"" Mr Trump told the General Assembly on Tuesday. Iran's government, he said, was bent on ""death and destruction"", while its people wanted change. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on Twitter that ""Trump's ignorant hate speech"" belonged ""in medieval times - not the 21st Century UN"". Allow Twitter content?

Using almost biblical language, the American leader portrayed the world in terms of ""decent nations"" confronted with ""rogue regimes"". ""If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph,"" he said in thespeech,external. ""When decent people and nations become bystanders to history the forces of destruction only gather power and strength."" The General Assembly was opened by Mr Guterres, who said that millions of people were living in dread as a result of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. ""The use of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable,"" he said. ""But today global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at the highest level since the end of the Cold War."" The former head of the UN refugee agency also spoke of being ""pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated - and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain"". According to Reuters news agency, when Mr Trump made his remarks about destroying North Korea, one man in the audience covered his face with his hands, while Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom crossed her arms. Loud, startled murmurs filled the hall, according to the agency. Mr Macron was elected French president in May and also addressed the General Assembly for the first time In his speech, President Macron said climate change was starting to take revenge on man, and extreme weather events would erase the differences between rich and poor countries. He promised an extra â¬5bn ($6bn; Â£4.4bn) of French investment to fight climate change. The French leader also defended the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Renouncing it would be a grave error,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sided with Mr Trump in his speech, saying the deal with Iran should be amended or scrapped altogether, and warned against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his speech to urge the Iraqi government to stop the  Kurdistan Regional Government holding areferendum on independenceon 25 September.

"Debbie Speranza (centre) with her identically dressed friends, and the bride, Julia Mammone For many women, turning up to a 'do' in the same dress as someone else would be crushing, but when you find five other wedding guests have picked the same outfit all you can probably do is laugh. So instead of spending the day at a wedding in Sydney, Australia, trying to avoid each other, six friends in almost identical dresses decided to poke fun at themselves and lined up for a photograph with the bride, Julia Mammone. Julia also saw the funny side along with Facebook users who have viewed and shared the photo more than 42,000 times. It was posted by Debbie Speranza, who dubbed herself and her friends ""#backupbridesmaids,external."" Laughing at the coincidence, Debbie posted a second photo, and asked: ""What are the odds,external?"" Slightly overwhelmed at the ""outta control"" social media reaction, Debbie said she was still amused by what happened. Harassed women are Facebook tagging this man for help Parsons Green: Treating trauma with tea and kindness Will Germany's new law kill free speech online? Debbie also shared the photo with the shop where the women had bought their dresses, saying: ""You really should start a bridal registry so that your customers can enquire whether anyone else has purchased one of your dresses for the same event  -no we are NOT the bridesmaids just the guests,external."" That post alone drew more than 10,000 comments with friends tagging each other with memories of similar, if not such large-scale, fashion faux pas. Jamie-Leigh Austin's friend Laura Frazer said wearing the same dress to a wedding as a stranger was a great conversation starter. But Yeng Vang wrote: ""My worst nightmare being dressed the same as someone else. I would literally go home and change."" And Sandra James wrote about turning up to her daughter's wedding only to find she was wearing the same outfit as the mother-of-the-groom. Rather than dodging the photographer, she said she was on ""such a high"" that both women just decided to get on and embrace the day. But spare a thought for Chantel Lopex-Rubio. It can be hard enough to cope when you're at a fancy function wearing the same dress as another guest - or as five others - but how do you recover when you realise your expensive frock is a dead ringer for the curtains?

Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News In the heat and humidity of
Mexico City, there's also hope. Police officers guard a six-storey office and
residential building in the bohemian La Condesa neighbourhood. The concrete
structure has been flattened to a towering mass of bricks and twisted metal. The damage is so severe I have
to look at the building next door, which remains intact, to get an idea of its
neighbour's pre-quake state. Moments later a team of rescuers in blue overalls
and red hats strap head torches on as they prepare to enter the building. More than 50 people have been
rescued in this city so far. People here are determined to make sure the number of those saved outpaces the death toll. As is often the case in the wake
of a devastating natural disaster, people are also displaying resilience.
Hundreds of people are wandering the streets holding handwritten signs that offer water and food to people. A man also holds a sign that says ""no
smoking"". The earthquake has also led to many gas leaks and that, as well
as the fear of further aftershocks, remains a concern here.

"This video can not be played A man was arrested in Newport on Tuesday in connection with the attack A third man has been arrested over Friday's Tube attack in Parsons Green. The 25-year-old was arrested in Newport, south Wales, on Tuesday evening, Scotland Yard said. An address in Newport is being searched. On Saturday an 18-year-old man, who the BBC has learnt had previously been referred to an anti-extremist programme, was arrested in Dover port. A 21-year-old man was also arrested in Hounslow, west London. Both are still in custody. A homemade bomb partially exploded in a train at Parsons Green station, injuring 30 people in rush hour. The 25-year-old was arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act. The arrest was carried out by the Met's Counter-Terrorism Command, supported by Gwent Police and the Welsh Extremism and Counter-Terrorism Unit. A police cordon remained in place on Jeffrey Street in Newport on Wednesday morning Tube staff's accounts of bomb 'pandemonium' Residents in Sunbury told to get out of homes Metropolitan Police Commander Dean Haydon said: ""This continues to be a fast-moving investigation. ""A significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday. ""We now have three men in custody and searches are continuing at four addresses."" About 30 people were injured in the tube attack, some were treated for burn injuries The 18-year-old arrested man is thought to have lived in a foster home owned by Ronald and Penelope Jones in Sunbury-on-Thames. He is thought to have moved to the UK from Iraq aged 15 when his parents died. The BBC has learnt that he had been referred to an anti-extremist programme before his arrest. It is not known who made the referral and when - or how serious the concerns were. Sources did not name the flagship Prevent programme, but it is thought that this is the mostly likely case as the referral for help was at local authority level. Prevent is managed and delivered locally by multi-agency teams of social workers, police officers and other specialists. He was already in contact with social services because of his foster care placement.

Mr Farroukh worked at Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, and has been described as a former foster child who had lived in the Jones's house. Mr Farroukh posted a picture on his Instagram page in May this year with a suitcase on Cavendish Road, Sunbury, almost directly outside the Jones's house. Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh is believed to be the 21-year-old suspect arrested by police The properties already being searched are the Jones's house in Sunbury, Mr Farroukh's house in Stanwell, and Aladdins chicken shop. At 08:20 BST on Friday a homemade bomb, which was transported in a Lidl bag, partially exploded in a Tube train at Parsons Green station, causing burns to a number of victims. BBC News has obtained CCTV footage showing a person leaving the property in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag at 07:04 BST on Friday morning. It has also established more precise details of the suspect's movements: The man carrying the shopping bag then took the 07:15 BST train to Wimbledon, which arrived at 07:46. After leaving the train he spent 20 minutes in the station toilets, before joining the District Line towards central London. Detectives believe the suspect got off four stops later at Putney Bridge, which is one stop before Parsons Green station where the homemade bomb caught fire minutes later.

"Three people have been arrested following the death of a British woman who disappeared while kayaking up the Amazon, police in Brazil have said. Emma Kelty, 43, of London, went missing last week. Her body has not been found. While drug traffickers and pirates operate in the region, police say she had been robbed, with one of the suspects claiming she was shot twice. Ms Kelty's family said they were extremely proud of her and ""her strength would be sorely missed"". The Foreign Office said earlier it was ""supporting the family of a British woman following her death in Brazil"". Ms Kelty disappeared in the upper stretches of the Amazon in northern Brazil, often referred to as the Solimoes River - an area known for pirate attacks and drug traffickers. Some of her belongings, including her kayak, were found by the Brazilian navy on Friday, according to police chief Ivo Martins. According to the chief of the Amazonas state police, the robbers had attempted to sell Ms Kelty's two mobile phones, GoPro camera and a tablet computer. Frederico Mendes told BBC Brasil he suspected the Briton had been killed because she had been seen by local people the day before. Ms Kelty was 42 days into a 4,000-mile trip along the Amazon river from its source to the Atlantic Ocean and had been documenting her trip on Twitter. Ms Kelty's brothers Piers and Giles and sister Natasha said in a statement: ""Emma was an active and determined sister who challenged herself, latterly through her adventures on the Pacific Coast Trail, as well as in the South Pole and Amazon River. ""In a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable. ""We wish to give our immense thanks to the Brazilian navy, police and Foreign Office for their action and support."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The day before she tweeted that she saw ""30 to 50 men armed with rifles and arrows in boats"". Ms Kelty, in a Facebook post on 10 September, wrote about the dangers of the area she was entering: ""So in or near Coari (100km away) I will have my boat stolen and I will be killed too. Nice."" After travelling past the town, she posted two days later: ""Am in the clear. All OK"". Emma Kelty posted a picture of her tent on 10 September, a few days before she went missing The former head teacher's previous expeditions included a solo ski trip to the South Pole in January. Speaking to BBC Surrey in February, she talked about the risks she would face in the Amazon, including ""people who organ-harvest and rob and fire guns"". Asked if she was risking her life on these adventures, she said: ""Oh yes, I mean that's half the challenge. ""But it's about minimising the risk. I'm going to a self-defence course which is going to be tailored to de-arming people, so if I do come across that situation at least I'm prepared for it."" Olie Hunter Smart, an explorer who completed a similar route in 2015, said Coari was an area known for its danger. He had met Ms Kelty before her trip to help her plan for the journey. Mr Smart, who is currently walking the length of India, said: ""The Emma that I met was an incredibly brave and courageous person who lived life to the full. ""My thoughts go out to her close friends and family at this very sad time.""

"Hull has one of the highest levels of problem debt In at least 10 areas of the UK, more than a fifth of the residents are missing bill payments repeatedly, according to research. New figures from the Money Advice Service suggest inner-city areas are the worst affected. In Newham, in the East End of London, and Sandwell in the West Midlands, at least 22% of residents have problem debts. In Manchester, more than 90,000 adults are struggling with repayments. The total number of people in such difficulties has risen by about 100,000 in the past six months to 8.3 million, according to the Money Advice Service. However, that is fewer than the 8.8 million who had problem debts in 2013. Reality check: Has personal debt been growing? Personal borrowing slows down Over-indebted individuals are defined as those who find meeting monthly bills a heavy burden, or those who miss at least three bill payments in a six-month period. Newham, East London: 22.7% Tower Hamlets, East London: 22.7% Sandwell, West Midlands: 22.1% Nottingham: 21.9% Barking and Dagenham, East London: 21.8% Blaenau Gwent, South Wales: 21.6% Hull: 21.5% Manchester: 21.5% Leicester: 21% Hackney: 20.9% Source: Money Advice Service By contrast, 9.7% of the population in East Dorset has difficulty meeting bills. Residents of Surrey and Buckinghamshire also tend to have fewer difficulties. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),told the Guardian,externalthat debt was a particular issue for those with erratic incomes, such as workers in the gig economy. ""Credit is a means of smoothing (incomes), but the question is how do you structure it in a sustainable fashion? ""It needs government involvement,"" he said. The latest figures from the Bank of England indicate that the growth in consumer credit is actually slowing. In July,annual growth fell to 9.8%, the slowest pace in over a year. It peaked at a rate of 10.8% in November last year. However, the squeeze on living standards induced by high inflation and low wage growth could make it harder for many people to repay their debts.

"Many of the affected apps are games and educational titles Owners of iPhones and iPads who install the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system will find that some older apps will stop working. The move will generally affect apps that have not been updated in the past two years. Although many will have been abandoned by their developers, owners will still use some of them frequently. It is a consequence of iOS 11 being restricted to running apps written in what is known as 64-bit code. The number signifies how much data a processor can handle at once - the larger the figure, the faster a computer can potentially operate. Dropping support for 32-bit software lets Apple streamline its operating system and helps it run more quickly since it no longer needs to load software libraries to make sense of the older programs. Apple has explained in the past that it is relatively easy for app-makers to reversion their products, and its App Store has rejected updates that lack 64-bit support since June 2015. Even so, the move bucks a general trend for operating systems to support legacy software for longer periods of time. ""Two years is a very short period for something to become obsolete, even in the technology world where things move very fast,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey's computing department. ""What most vendors have done so far - and Microsoft is the biggest example of this - is to keep as many things as compatible as possible for as long as possible. ""It wouldn't have taken a huge amount of work for iOS 11 to have continued supporting 32-bit, so it's difficult not to conclude that Apple is really trying to force the pace and make people move on."" The iOS 11 update became available to download earlier in the day. Apple has made it possible to check which apps will stop working before iOS 11 is installed Many of the affected apps are by independent developers who have shifted focus to other projects. However, the list also contains software from more established publishers, including: several Disney products, including its Winnie the Pooh Puzzle Book, Tangled digital book, and Princess & the Frog app high-profile video games, including 2K's XCom: Enemy Within and Gears' Flappy Bird American Express's Amex UK-iPad several Penguin Books apps for young children, including its Ladybird I'm Ready to Spell and First Focus titles, as well as its Spot Goes to School interactive book Some of these products were still on sale in the App Store at time of writing. IPhone and iPad owners can find out which, if any, products they will lose access to by going into their devices' Settings menu, clicking the About button and then tapping the Applications subheading. There are, however, benefits to installing iOS 11. Users of iOS 11 will be presented with a revamped App Store Among them are: support for new augmented-reality apps, which mix together graphics and real-world views a redesigned App Store that includes articles about some of the products and developers it features improved voices for Siri a ""do not disturb"" facility that activates when a device detects it is being used in a moving vehicle ""Of course, you don't have to upgrade to iOS 11, and in theory you could say people have a choice,"" said Prof Woodward. ""But in practice users are bound to go up to the new version, assuming their products support it."" Apple unveils Â£999 iPhone X Apple explains Face ID's on-stage failure iPhone X: the internet reacts Apple's augmented ambitions iPhone X: 10 key moments leading to the handset The number of bits in relation to a microprocessor affects the size of the numbers that can be handled by its registers - the tiny bits of memory on the processing chip itself. Those numbers are then used to address Ram (random-access memory). In the case of 32-bit architecture, the amount of memory than can be addressed is two to the power of 32, in other words 4.3 billion values. In the case of 64-bit architecture the processor can theoretically address 18,400,000 trillion values. As a result, operating systems written for 32-bit chips can only access up to 4GB of Ram, but those written for 64-bit processors can, in theory, support up to 16 billion gigabytes of Ram. If a program has been written to take advantage of a 64-bit operating system, it should mean the processor can access data that is in this larger memory rather than retrieving it from flash storage or a hard disk, which can speed up the whole processing chain. However, including more Ram also makes equipment more expensive and power-hungry. None of Apple's iOS products to date has included more than 4GB of Ram.

"Dark sky experts are gathering for the first European conference - which is being staged in southern Scotland. The three-day event is taking place in Gatehouse of Fleet in Dumfries and Galloway. The nearby Galloway Forest Park was the first area in Europe to achieve dark sky park status. Organisers said they hoped the conference would further help to cement south west Scotland's reputation as a premier destination for stargazing. The conference will bring together some of the world's top dark sky experts with the aim of promoting rural development, tourism and tackling light pollution issues. Astronomers, town planners, lighting specialists, environmentalist and academics will attend to discuss the benefits that dark sky status can bring. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham gave the keynote speech. ""Scotland's natural environment, including its dark sky places, is one of its unique selling points and one that we should never take for granted,"" she said. ""Dark sky places have an important part to play in raising awareness of light pollution and its effects on people and the environment. ""However, we can share best practice and use more efficient technologies to reduce energy consumption and overall light pollution."" She said dark sky places could improve the environment and provide a ""big attraction"" for stargazers from all over the world, helping to boost the economy. ""It's a win win situation,"" she said. The conference has been organised by Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Biosphere (GSAB), the International Dark Sky Association (IDSA) and Forest Enterprise Scotland (FES), which manages the Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park. FES visitor services manager Keith Muir said a lot had been achieved since the park reached dark sky status. ""We set it up on the back of bringing people into the south west of Scotland over the winter months,"" he said. He said an impact study in 2012/13 had shown it was generating about Â£500,000 for the local economy. However, with the introduction of dark sky rangers and more events he believes that figure will have risen further. ""It has developed greatly and I would estimate we are easily up around about the Â£800,000 mark a year now just on dark skies alone and that's a big thing,"" he said. Mr Muir added that there would be some important issues on the agenda over the three days. ""There's the straight fact that we are losing the ability to see our night sky,"" he said. ""The stars are not just used by us in lots of different ways but they are also used by migrating birds and everything else to actually navigate by. ""Light pollution is causing all sorts of health issues and there is lots of research out there saying that we are only just beginning to see the long-term effects of that. He said there were also environmental issues related to energy use. ""We spend hundreds of millions of pounds lighting our streets,"" he said. ""If we were to do something about that - not just about putting in better lighting but actually using less power - then we would be saving us all a lot of money, saving the government a lot of money and saving the planet from a whole load of other things that go round as well. ""But we are not there yet.""

"A huge earthquake has killed more than 200 people in central Mexico Almost half of those killed died in the capital, Mexico City A school in Mexico City's Coapa district collapsed, killing at least 30 people, mostly children Hundreds of volunteers have joined emergency services in the search for survivors The magnitude 7.1 quake had its epicentre in Puebla, south-east of the capital Four thousand troops have been brought in to help Gareth Evans and Claudia Allen Thank you for following our live coverage of the aftermath of Mexico's worst earthquake in over 30 years. At time of writing, Mexican officials are still searching through collapsed buildings, including one school where an eight-year-old girl named Frida has been spotted by rescuers. The Mexican government has confirmed that 255 people have died around the country, and at least 38 buildings collapsed on Mexico City during Tuesday's quake. As the sun sets on Mexico City, the country's foreign minister tells BBC News at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York that ""the world is embracing Mexico"". For all the latest updates,go to our main story here. Speaking to the BBC at the UN General Assembly in New York, Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso says his country is overwhelmed by the international response to the quake. This video can not be played 'The world is embracing Mexico' - foreign minister at UN meetings The El Universal daily newspaper reports that the eight-year-old girl detected under the rubble of her school is named Frida. She was discovered trapped in a space only ""45cm high"" (17.5in). Rescuers also tell El Universal their thermal
detection equipment may have also picked up signs of life in other parts of the
building. They believe there may be three other people trapped alive inside the collapsed building. The Israeli Defence Forces have sent 70 soldiers, including building engineers, to Mexico City to help with structural assessments. Allow Twitter content?

Mexico City, there's also hope. Police officers guard a six-storey office and
residential building in the bohemian La Condesa neighbourhood. The concrete
structure has been flattened to a towering mass of bricks and twisted metal. The damage is so severe I have
to look at the building next door, which remains intact, to get an idea of its
neighbour's pre-quake state. Moments later a team of rescuers in blue overalls
and red hats strap head torches on as they prepare to enter the building. More than 50 people have been
rescued in this city so far. People here are determined to make sure the number of those saved outpaces the death toll. As is often the case in the wake
of a devastating natural disaster, people are also displaying resilience.
Hundreds of people are wandering the streets holding handwritten signs that offer water and food to people. A man also holds a sign that says ""no
smoking"". The earthquake has also led to many gas leaks and that, as well
as the fear of further aftershocks, remains a concern here. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan sends us this report from Mexico City in front of an apartment block that became a tomb for 20 residents when it collapsed. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The bomb disposal unit was sent to assess the ""suspicious object"" Motorists were left stranded for several hours after a ""suspicious object"" was found under a bridge, forcing the closure of the M1. The 11-mile (18km) stretch between junctions 15 at Northampton and 14 at Milton Keynes was shut both ways at 07:30 BST. Thames Valley Police later said the object was not an explosive. The northbound carriage has now reopened, but southbound remains closed, Highways England said. It said ""specialist"" carriageway clearance work was still ongoing on the southbound side, but all trapped traffic has now been released. Trapped northbound motorists were stranded for several hours before being redirected from the scene via Newport Pagnell services. Footage earlier showed a bomb disposal robot pulling a bin bag off the hard shoulder. The bag appeared to contain a yellow substance. Police said the liquid appeared to be a corrosive chemical and analysis was ongoing. Thames Valley Police chief inspector Mark Lewis said there was ""no evidence to suggest that this is a terrorist-related incident"".

"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake? If it is safe to do so you can email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Jennifer Swaddle, a teacher at the British International School in Mexico City, told the BBC that part of her classroom had collapsed. ""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican It is feared the death toll will rise further The Mexican government earlier issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

"Highways England say the window height bins are easier for drivers to dispose of litter without leaving their vehicles Drivers are being encouraged to throw rubbish out of their windows into bright orange bins in a bid to keep motorways cleaner. The funnel-shaped bins would be introduced at 12 service areas in the  North West, said Highways England. They are designed so drivers do not need to leave their vehicles. The first are on the M6 at Lymm, Cheshire. Clean Up Britain founder John Read described the funnel bins as a low-cost gimmick. Highways England said the first bins were aimed at lorry drivers, as many HGVs used the motorway services, Further funnel bins would be installed for both cars and lorries at other service stations in the coming weeks. The bins are designed to be at window height. The first bins are aimed at lorry drivers Mr Read said: ""This appears like a low-cost gimmick to try and pretend that Highways England is doing something about the massive problem of litter on motorways. ""Highways England just needs to do its job properly, and keep the entire motorway network clear of litter, not just 25 so-called 'hotspots'. ""The reality is that virtually the entire network is a litter hotspot."" An initial 10-week trial on the M3 at Winchester last year showed a 25% reduction in litter on the ground within the service area, Highways England said. The company said more than 40,000 sacks of litter were collected from motorways in the North West last year - an average of 108 sacks for every mile of motorway.

"This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Hurricane Maria, the devastating storm pushing north-west through the Caribbean, is battering Puerto Rico. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it made landfall in Yabucoa in the east of the US territory, and now has strong winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The US territory's governor said damage was inevitable as driving rain and winds hit the Puerto Rican capital. On the island of Dominica, which was badly affected on Monday, seven people are reported to have been killed. Aerial footage over the island shows flattened houses and the death toll on Dominica is likely to rise, with details remaining scant as communication links are down. On Tuesday, Maria ploughed through St Croix in the US Virgin Islands, home to around 55,000 people. Shortly before making landfall in Puerto Rico, the storm was downgraded from category five to category four by the NHC. Footage posted on social media showed a torrent of water pouring through the streets of Guayama on the island's south coast. Palm trees were bent double in Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan In San Juan, palm trees were bent double and electricity cables were blown loose as debris was thrown through the air. As of 11:00 local time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was around 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan. Up to 90% of island residents were without electricity, El Nuevo Dia newspaper quoted Governor Ricardo Rossello as saying. Mr Rossello earlier told the island's 3.5 million people to seek shelter. He warned residents to prepare for ""the worst storm of the last century"" as about 500 shelters were made available to accommodate tens of thousands of people. ""God is with us; we are stronger than any hurricane,""Mr Rossello said,external. ""Together we will rise again."" Puerto Rico has experienced just one category five storm since 1851 - the Okeechobee Hurricane in 1928. PM's Facebook posts detail storm drama Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after This video can not be played Hurricane Maria brought high winds to Guadeloupe Maria is the second storm of this strength to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season - the first being category five Irma earlier in September. Maria began moving roughly along the same track as Irma. Officials in Puerto Rico feared the debris left by Irma could prove extremely dangerous in the high winds. There were also concerns that heavy rain could cause landslides in some places, and that a predicted storm surge of up to 9ft (2.7m) could swamp low-lying areas, with ""destructive waves"" expected to pummel the coast. The NHC also warned that Maria could deliver several tornadoes over Puerto Rico on Wednesday. By Will Grant in San Juan People across Puerto Rico are just trying to ride out this storm as best they can now. From where we're hunkered down, the powerful winds are creating an incredible noise, rattling storm shutters and doors almost off their hinges. The electricity is out in our hotel and it is too dark and too dangerous to try to see what is happening outside. Like millions of others, we have little choice at present except to stay put and wait in the darkness for the huge hurricane to pass. The difficulty is, it is moving slowly - giving Maria more time to unleash its power on the island and its infrastructure. Some projections have shown the storm covering the entire island in the coming hours, hitting Puerto Rico with sustained hurricane force winds and large amounts of rainfall. Hurricane Maria is now the strongest storm to make landfall on the island in almost a century. Most are just praying that when they can eventually emerge from their places of shelter, they and their loved ones are safe and that the damage hasn't been too extensive. Are you in an area affected by Hurricane Maria? Share your experience:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hurricane Maria early on Tuesday On Wednesday an adviser to Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Hartley Henry, said the full extent of the storm's damage was not yet known and that the death toll was likely to rise. ""It's difficult to determine the level of fatalities but so far seven are confirmed as a direct result of the hurricane,"" he said. As a result of the strong winds, roofs had been ripped from dozens of buildings. ""The main general hospital took a beating,"" Mr Henry said, adding: ""Patient care has been compromised."" The first aerial footage of the island confirms ""significant damage"", Ronald Jackson of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said. This video can not be played First aerial footage from Dominica It shows flattened buildings, rivers which have burst their banks and a flooded runway. Dominica has been virtually cut off with telecommunications severed, but local amateur radio operators say more than 90% of properties have been damaged. The former British colony, which has a population of 72,000 and is less than 50km long and 25km wide, escaped Hurricane Irma two weeks ago. But on Monday the eye of the new category five storm passed directly over. The last communication from the island was from Mr Skerrit just as the storm struck late on Monday, when he said in aFacebook post,externalthat the winds had swept away the roofs of ""almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with"". This video can not be played Hurricane Maria gathers strength again The storm arrived at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday in St Croix, where roughly half the US Virgin Islands' residents live. On Monday, the French territory of Martinique was hit by power cuts but escaped serious damage. This video can not be played Footage from Martinique shows early devastating winds There was flooding in the French territory of Guadeloupe, where one person was killed by a falling tree and another died on the seafront. At least two others were missing after their ship sank near Desirade, the easternmost island in the archipelago. About 80,000 homes lost power in Guadeloupe. There are reports of flooding, mudslides and power outages in parts of St Lucia. Some islands in Maria's path escaped the worst of Hurricane Irma and have been used as bases to distribute relief to places that were not so fortunate. Now there are concerns that this work could be jeopardised if they are badly hit, too. Puerto Ricans have been preparing in the capital, San Juan Guadeloupe has been a bridgehead for aid going to Irma-hit French territories, while Puerto Rico has also been offering crucial assistance to its neighbours.

History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican It is feared the death toll will rise further The Mexican government earlier issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

Here's what you need to know: The BBC's David Shukman explains why there has been a recent flurry of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic. This video can not be played Why are there so many hurricanes? Harvey, Irma, Maria. The intensity of this hurricane season means fast and strong storms have been bearing down one after another. So, how should people prepare? For expert advice,read our piecedetailing what to do before, during and after a hurricane. Lena Samuels, an aide to the prime minister of St Kitts and Nevis, gives an update from the islands as Hurricane Maria approaches. She told the BBC that the ""wind and the rain hadn't let up"" and the island country is ""battening down the hatches"". This video can not be played Hurricane Maria: St Kitts and Nevis battens down the hatches The French Interior Minister, GÃ©rard Collombâ,says,external80,000 homes are without electricity in Guadeloupe. He adds that the extent of the damage on the island is ""uncertain"". One death has been confirmed in the French overseas territory, which has a population of 465,000. A flooded road in Guadeloupe after Hurricane Maria passed Will GrantBBC News, San Juan, Puerto Rico Thereâs an uneasy combination of expectation and
nervousness in San Juan as residents wait for the arrival of a second huge
hurricane in as many weeks. Irma didnât cause significant damage in Puerto Rico, yet thousands
are still without power and conditions for those in poorer, less stable housing
remain difficult. Hurricane Maria, however, is likely to make a far more direct
hit on the island and could be the most powerful storm to make landfall on the
territory in 85 years. In advance of the high winds and rain, people are boarding
up their homes, many businesses have already closed and it appears most
families are simply not venturing out except to find the most necessary items. Bottled water is beginning to sell out in stores and people are tracking the
path of the storm carefully. Tension has risen a little further since people heard
of the damage that Hurricane Maria caused on the tiny island of Dominica. With Puerto Rico in the middle of a deep economic crisis
and some communities still recovering from the last event, this is a bad time for
the island to be experiencing another giant storm. For now, however, Governor Ricardo Rossello has simply
urged people not to risk their lives and for those in wooden or poorly
constructed housing to seek refuge with family or friends. People are boarding up their homes in advance of Hurricane Maria Radar imagery from the UK's national weather service shows the outer rain bands of Hurricane Maria beginning to cross the US and British Virgin Islands. A curfew was imposed in the British Virgin Islands on Monday night, and residents have been asked to stay indoors until the storm has passed. US forecasters say a storm surge - rising seawater coming in from the coast - is also expected to bring ""life-threatening"" swells of up to 9ft (2.7m) above ground in the Virgin Islands as well as Puerto Rico.

Speaking on John Bishop's TV show, the former Bake Off winner described her condition as ""a monster"". And she said she hadn't become ""a new woman"" since shooting to fame in 2015. ""Some days the monster shouts in my face. No matter where I turn, he will keep shouting at me. I can't get him out of my face,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down.

The 11-mile (18km) stretch between junctions 15 at Northampton and 14 at Milton Keynes was shut both ways at 07:30 BST. Thames Valley Police later said the object was not an explosive. The northbound carriage has now reopened, but southbound remains closed, Highways England said. It said ""specialist"" carriageway clearance work was still ongoing on the southbound side, but all trapped traffic has now been released. Trapped northbound motorists were stranded for several hours before being redirected from the scene via Newport Pagnell services. Footage earlier showed a bomb disposal robot pulling a bin bag off the hard shoulder. The bag appeared to contain a yellow substance. Police said the liquid appeared to be a corrosive chemical and analysis was ongoing. Thames Valley Police chief inspector Mark Lewis said there was ""no evidence to suggest that this is a terrorist-related incident"". Live updates on this story and more Motorists were stranded on the M1 between junctions 15 and 14 for hours The Ministry of Defence said it had provided police with ""explosive ordnance device assistance"". Insp Lewis said as there was no explosive device there had been no controlled explosion. ""The object contains a highly corrosive material which has leaked across lanes one and two, therefore the clear up process will take a significant amount of time,"" he said. Motorists resorted to playing games and walking to service stations Tim Mayer, a Conservative councillor from Coventry caught up in the delays, earlier said people had been trying to make the most of the free time. ""There's a five-a-side football competition, a bit of rugby, a guy cycling up and down in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""There are a few people with coffee in the car who have shared it around and others with some boiled sweets who have been generous. ""But the communication from police has been appalling."" On Twitter, former England cricketerJames Taylor,externaljoked he ""might get the clubs out - perfect driving range"". Highways England has a diversion in place for those travelling southbound via the A508. At the scene - Mike Cartwright, BBC News I've been speaking to people who have been stuck on the M1 for hours now. Trevor Larkun has been stranded since 08:30, he says people are being ""mostly patient"" and chatting to other motorists. ""The mood is OK, we've had a few people come and deliver bottles of water and crisps,"" he said. ""I've got sympathy for people I've seen walking down the hard shoulder with suitcases, presumably trying to catch a flight. ""The worst thing is you don't know how long you're going to be here for."" Mr Larkun said that police officers told other motorists they may cut the central reservation at some point to release vehicles from the carriageway. A number of fire crews are also in attendance Some people caught up in the delays have been playing football on the empty stretch of M1 Allow Twitter content?

"Some pilots have blamed a lack of staff for the cancellations Is Ryanair short of pilots? It's a critical question. It could help explain why 400,000 Ryanair passengers are having flights cancelled over the next few weeks. But it's hard to give a straight answer. The company's boss, Michael O'Leary, is adamant that they don't have a pilot shortage. He says the cancellations are down to a cock-up with the holiday rotas, combined with bad weather and air traffic control delays and strikes. But I got a completely different message from several former and current Ryanair pilots, who are equally as strident that a lack of pilots is also to blame. Some of these people told me that they are risking their jobs by talking to the media. At least two used the word ""droves"" to describe the numbers leaving right now. There is a buoyant market for pilots, as airlines such as Norwegian and Jet2 are expanding. We know 140 Ryanair pilots have gone to Norwegian this year. Jet2 wouldn't give us a number. One pilot told me that on a recent recruitment drive for another airline, 32 of the 40 people they took on were from Ryanair. I heard: ""Pilots are really annoyed at being blamed for taking holidays."" They feel they were being used as scapegoats for these cancellations. They were all sure that the problems were ""self-induced"", because people are leaving ""quicker than they can replace them"". And the training programmes for pilots are ""weeks, even months"" in arrears, so ""cadets aren't getting trained"". Boss Michael O'Leary is adamant Ryanair doesn't have a shortage Many instructors ""have quit, causing extreme disruption"". I asked Ryanair if their training department was understaffed and they said it was ""untrue"". This comment from one pilot sums up what most were telling me. ""The issue is one of crewing, and crewing only. No company plans to implement a leave system that leaves them woefully undermanned during a peak period. Had Ryanair had enough pilots, this would not have been an issue. However, the lack of pilots has been laid bare for all to see."" Ryanair publishes full list of cancellations Ryanair and 'total disaster' holiday Ryanair: What should I do if my flight is cancelled? Another said: ""Bizarrely, people that work here are laughing, because it's finally all coming out."" Several talked about a ""toxic"" atmosphere and how they felt ""undervalued"". The company is offering a Â£12,000 bonus to captains who stay from now until the end of October 2018. But there is anger at the strings attached. You must fly 800 hours over the year, work extra days, you can't take more than four days' sick leave and so on. They tell me it's a high bar to qualify. The people I spoke to said Ryanair was a good company to join as a young pilot, because they make you a captain quickly. But once you've gained experience, you can get a much better and more secure job elsewhere, especially now.  And that's exactly what they are doing. To me, talking to these pilots, it felt like payback. This all came from more than a dozen staff, but that is out of 4,200 pilots. They all contacted me because they wanted a voice for their frustrations and they'd had enough of their employer. So they had an axe to grind. And they all admitted that they'd got good, well-paid jobs compared to many. No-one is forcing them to work at Ryanair. The company could not have been clearer yesterday. When I asked if a lack of pilots was exacerbating the problem, they told me: ""This is not true. These cancellations are not a result of pilot shortages."" But the staff that I spoke to universally disagreed. In fact, the company's denial riled them so much that they decided to get in touch. One warned that this problem could rear up again next summer, because it takes three months for a pilot to work their notice at another airline and another three months to train them. So you can't just employ a load of pilots at short notice. ""The only way to stop this happening again is for the company to get better at keeping its staff,"" said one.

"This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? US President Donald Trump has told the UN General Assembly that America would destroy North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. In his debut speech, he mocked North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" North Korea has tested nuclear bombs and missiles in defiance of the UN. Just before Mr Trump spoke, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had urged statesmanship, saying: ""We must not sleepwalk our way into war."" The American leader also attacked Iran, saying it was a ""corrupt dictatorship"" intent on destabilising the Middle East. This video can not be played Trump's UN audience agrees on one thing about his speech He called on the government in Tehran to cease supporting terrorism and again criticised the Obama-era international agreement over Iran's nuclear programme, which he called an embarrassment. In his own debut speech, French President Emmanuel Macron strongly defended the Paris climate accord, signed in the same room in New York two years ago and rejected in June by Mr Trump, towidespread international dismay. TheGeneral Assembly,external, which continues until Monday, is an annual event, bringing together leaders of the UN's 193 member states. Key messages from Trump's speech Reality Check: Has UN staffing doubled since 2000? In other parts of Mr Trump's speech he: said the US could ""no longer be taken advantage of or enter one-sided deals"" said the crisis in Venezuela, which is led by a leftwing government hostile to the US, was ""unacceptable"" and America could not ""stand by and watch"" denounced socialism as an ideology, saying it had only brought ""anguish and devastation and failure"" condemned ""uncontrolled migration"" but insisted America was a ""compassionate nation"" which had spent billions of dollars on helping refugees return to their home countries Washington has repeatedly warned North Korea over its weapons tests, which violate UN Security Council resolutions. The crisis worsened last month whenthe North announced plans to test missiles around the US Pacific territory of Guam. Kim Jong-un watched a recent missile test in person ""If [the US] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump's threat to ""totally destroy"" North Korea is implausible, according to Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' ""I think the folks in the Pentagon when they look at military options are just aghast at the potential loss of life that could occur with at a minimum hundreds of thousands of South Koreans killed in Seoul,"" he told the BBC. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? President Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his ""America First"" doctrine but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. In contrast to the focus on globalisation that has driven so much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s, Mr Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system. There was a nod to the old axis of evil theme. He opposed ""the righteous many"" to ""the wicked few"", with his rogues' gallery taking in a predictable cast of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. Nonetheless Mr Trump's world view contained many contradictions. Where exactly is the boundary between national sovereignty and collective action? And does America's newfound foreign policy pragmatism extend just to calling for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela or actually for doing something practical about it? The 2015deal between Iran, the US and other world powers, including China and Russia, was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. ""Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it,"" Mr Trump told the General Assembly on Tuesday. Iran's government, he said, was bent on ""death and destruction"", while its people wanted change. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on Twitter that ""Trump's ignorant hate speech"" belonged ""in medieval times - not the 21st Century UN"". Allow Twitter content?

Using almost biblical language, the American leader portrayed the world in terms of ""decent nations"" confronted with ""rogue regimes"". ""If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph,"" he said in thespeech,external. ""When decent people and nations become bystanders to history the forces of destruction only gather power and strength."" The General Assembly was opened by Mr Guterres, who said that millions of people were living in dread as a result of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. ""The use of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable,"" he said. ""But today global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at the highest level since the end of the Cold War."" The former head of the UN refugee agency also spoke of being ""pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated - and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain"". According to Reuters news agency, when Mr Trump made his remarks about destroying North Korea, one man in the audience covered his face with his hands, while Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom crossed her arms. Loud, startled murmurs filled the hall, according to the agency. Mr Macron was elected French president in May and also addressed the General Assembly for the first time In his speech, President Macron said climate change was starting to take revenge on man, and extreme weather events would erase the differences between rich and poor countries. He promised an extra â¬5bn ($6bn; Â£4.4bn) of French investment to fight climate change. The French leader also defended the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Renouncing it would be a grave error,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sided with Mr Trump in his speech, saying the deal with Iran should be amended or scrapped altogether, and warned against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his speech to urge the Iraqi government to stop the  Kurdistan Regional Government holding areferendum on independenceon 25 September.

"This video can not be played Vince Cable: ""I ask you to join me on the journey as we, together, take the Liberal Democrats back to government"" Sir Vince Cable has said he can lead the Liberal Democrats back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"". In his first conference speech as leader, he said he was ""impatient for success"" and had the vision and ""grown-up"" approach to ""fill a huge gap in the centre of British politics"". He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality. And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer. Live: Vince Cable speech to Lib Dem conference Lib Dems will be 'radical and popular' Lib Dems mull how to stop Brexit All you need to know about Brexit The Lib Dems, he told activists in Bournemouth, were the ""only real, undiluted pro-European"" party in the country as he attacked the government's handling of the Brexit negotiations and what he said was Labour equivocation over whether to stay in the single market and customs union. He said his party must not be solely defined by their opposition to Brexit - but he repeated his call for the public to have the final say on whether the UK actually leaves or not through a further referendum. The 74-year old, who succeeded Tim Farron after June's general election, said the Lib Dems ""did a lot of good and stopped a lot of bad"" in their five years in coalition government with the Conservatives. But the party - which increased its MPs from eight to 12 in June, but saw its vote share go down - had paid a ""very high political price"". ""Trust was lost,"" he said. ""For many voters, we still have to scrub ourselves hard to get rid of the smell of clearing up other people's mess."" By the BBC's Eleanor Garnier in Bournemouth It was what you might call serious and sensible. Firmly fixed behind the lectern, Vince Cable drew a sharp contrast with his predecessor, Tim Farron, who would bound around the stage, bubbling with energy. He had no problem winning applause from the faithful Lib Dem audience but whether his first conference speech as leader will punch through to the wider electorate is another question. This was not a policy-rich speech but an attempt to set out broad ambitions, the principles behind the way Sir Vince wants the Lib Dems to grapple with the biggest issues the country faces. The Lib Dems look to him as a heavyweight politician, a former business secretary and one of the few to predict the financial crash. But leading the Lib Dems is a huge challenge. He needs to persuade voters of the party's stance on Brexit, improve on the disappointing general election result and make the party relevant in British politics once again. But he insisted the Lib Dems must see their future as a party of government again, with radical solutions to what he said were the main challenges facing the UK, including ""deeply corrosive"" inter-generational inequality, low economic productivity, skills shortages and the cost of living and housing for young people. On tuition fees, he said levels of student debt were a source of ""real concern"" and the party was ready to consider all options to improve the current system, including a graduate tax, in a wide-ranging review. Barriers to young people getting on the housing ladder must be removed, he said, with councils being able to borrow to build affordable homes and private sector investment in new garden cities. And he vowed to end the ""stranglehold of oligarchs and speculators in our housing market,"" with ""fierce tax penalties on the acquisition of property for investment purposes, by overseas residents"". Deputy leader Jo Swinson applauds Sir Vince's speech The Lib Dem leader left the auditorium with his wife Rachel Drawing on his parents' experience of going to night school after work to improve their prospects, he said all young people should be given an endowment or learning account to fund further studies at any stage of their lives - to be paid through the ""fair taxation of wealth"". Calling for a bigger programme of investment in the railways, broadband and other infrastructure, to be funded by government borrowing, he said his party would be both pro-enterprise and pro-worker, prepared to stand up to tech giants over corporate tax avoidance. But the former business secretary said the Lib Dems would never be a ""something for nothing"" party, contrasting them with Labour, for whom he suggested ""budgeting was a bourgeois hobby"". He said politics was often a long game and he had learnt from personal experience - including losing his first wife to cancer and losing his seat in 2015 - that success was ""often laced with setbacks"" and endurance was vital. ""What the country needs is hope and realism,"" he added. ""In a Britain increasingly dominated by extremists and ideologues, I want us to fill the huge gap in the centre of British politics."" He said the Lib Dems had been proved right in their opposition to the Iraq war and their economic warnings prior to the 2008 banking crisis and they were right to take a stand on Brexit. It was becoming ever clearer that the UK's exit from the EU was a ""looming disaster"" which could leave the UK poorer and weaker, he told party activists. ""There is another word for that - masochism. It isn't illegal. I am told some people pay good money to indulge in it. But unlike masochists, the Brexit ideologues usually envisage someone else bearing the pain. ""And that pain will mainly be felt by young people who overwhelmingly voted to Remain."" He urged members of other parties to join the Lib Dems: ""There are sensible grown-ups in the Conservative Party and Labour Party and the Greens. And beyond them are millions of people deeply worried about what is happening. ""We have to put aside tribal differences and work alongside like-minded people to keep the single market and customs union, essential for trade and jobs.""

"The number of people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire may be a little lower than the previous estimate of 80, police have said. They say the figure ""may come down a little bit"" because of some potential cases of fraud. Scotland Yard also said it may consider individual as well as corporate manslaughter charges. Meanwhile, eight-year-old Mehdi El-Wahabi is the latest victim of the 14 June blaze to be named. The Metropolitan Police, in a briefing, said 60 of the estimated 80 people killed have been formally identified. Commander Stuart Cundy said progress made in recovering remains was ""much higher"" than he had expected three months ago. In the initial weeks following the fire, police were unwilling to speculate on the final death toll. That left some people convinced that the eventual figure would be much higher than officially confirmed. Police said CCTV footage from the foyer of Grenfell Tower ""clearly"" showed around 240 people escaped the 24-story block, which contained 129 flats. 'Why I took photos of Grenfell victim' Grenfell inquiry 'will provide answers' Who were the victims? Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner said the investigation would deal with ""whatever offences come to light"". He said: ""The kind of stuff I would envisage we may come across would involve offences perhaps of fraud, misconduct offences, health and safety breaches, breaches of fire safety regulations, and of course offences of manslaughter, whether that be on a corporate or an individual level."" It emerged that the force is investigating eight fraud cases where people have tried to financially benefit from the fire - two people have been charged, one has been bailed, while the other allegations are still being looked into. This video can not be played A relative of one of victims says he wants people jailed over the disaster There have also been four allegations of theft from the lower levels while the building was under 24-hour security - one involving a ""considerable"" sum of money. Detective Chief Superintendent Fiona McCormack said: ""I can't tell you how personally devastating these reports of thefts are, for the victims, for me and everyone involved in the investigation who is working so hard."" The 24-hour security at Grenfell Tower has since been reviewed and changes have been ""immediately put into place"". Police also doubled the number of officers working in the tower this week in the hope of completing the recovery process by the New Year. Eight-year-old Mehdi El-Wahabi Mehdi El-Wahabi is believed to have died on the 21st floor of the tower block, along with his family. Paying tribute, his cousin, Senate Jones, said: ""You made me laugh and smile every day."" The deaths of his parents - Abdulaziz El-Wahabi, 52, and Faouzia, 41 - and their eldest son Yasin, 20, were confirmed at inquests, although there has still been no official news on their 15-year-old daughter Nur Huda. In a statement released by the Metropolitan Police, his surviving family said: ""Mehdi was a calm and friendly young boy who loved his family very much. ""He was loved by staff and pupils at his school who held a beautiful memorial and made a plaque in memory of him."" Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, wants ""individuals charged, prosecuted and sent to prison"" but says he knows the police inquiry will take time. He added: ""For us, it's been such a long wait just to get any news about my uncle - some people may never get that news. ""I can't begin to imagine what that feels like. It's awful. But that's why we will fight for justice."" The police have seized 31 million documents and identified 336 companies of interest.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Maria has hit Dominica and is making its way through the Caribbean Dominica has suffered ""widespread damage"" from Hurricane Maria, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit says, as the storm hammers neighbouring Guadeloupe. ""We have lost all that money can buy,"" Mr Skerrit said in a Facebook post. The hurricane suddenly strengthened to a ""potentially catastrophic"" category five storm, before making landfall on the Caribbean island. Earlier Mr Skerrit posted live updates as his roof was torn off, saying he was ""at the complete mercy"" of the storm. ""My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains,"" he wrote after being rescued. Latest updates on Hurricane Maria PM's Facebook posts detail storm drama Meanwhile officials on the French island of Guadeloupe are warning locals to stay sheltered, even if the hurricane appears to be easing in parts. Houses and roads have been submerged and half of the rain expected in the region has yet to fall, the Prefect of Guadeloupe, Eric Maire, has warned. ""The phenomenon is still ongoing, it is necessary to remain in a safe place even if lulls appear,"" Mr Maire said. Hurricane Maria is moving roughly along the same track as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region earlier this month. It has maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph), and was downgraded to a category four after hitting Dominica, before picking up full strength again. Life-threatening mudslides, flash floods and storm surges have been predicted by the US National Hurricane Center, which monitors the region. Allow Facebook content?

Dominica, a former British colony with a population of 72,000, is less than 50km long and 25km wide, and the eye of the storm passed directly over it. It made landfall at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT Tuesday), and Dominica's PM has called the damage ""devastating"" and ""mind boggling"". ""My focus now is in rescuing the trapped and securing medical assistance for the injured,"" he said, and called on the international community for help. ""We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds."" This video can not be played Hurricane Maria gathers strength again Curtis Matthew, a journalist based in the capital, Roseau, told the BBC that conditions went ""very bad, rapidly"". ""We still don't know what the impact is going to be when this is all over. But what I can say it does not look good for Dominica as we speak,"" he said. All ports and airports are closed and residents near the coast have been ordered to go to authorised shelters. This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Maria jumped from a category three to a brutal category five within just a few hours, which was an unexpected shock for people in Dominica. A factor in its rapid development is that local sea surface temperatures are currently anomalously high by a margin of around one to two degrees, says BBC weather forecaster Steve Cleaton. The elevated sea surface temperature will have contributed to the rapid development of this system, in concert with other very favourable atmospheric conditions within the locale such as low wind shear, our meteorologist adds. Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory just to the north of Guadeloupe, is likely to be affected next. It has been issued with hurricane warnings, along with St Kitts and Nevis, the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Antigua, as well as Barbuda, St Martin and Anguilla, all of which are still reeling after Irma. UK territories prepare for worst There is a similar warning for Dutch islands Saba and St Eustatius. In the British Virgin Islands, British authorities - who have been working on Irma relief projects - are among those who have expressed fears that debris left behind by the first storm could be whipped up by the second, posing an extra threat. As the hurricane struck in the middle of the night it has been difficult to assess the extent of the damage so far. The French territory of Martinique has been hit by power cuts but is thought to have escaped serious damage. ""Reconnaissance operations are still under way but already we can see that there is no significant damage,"" said Jacques Witkowski, France's head of civil protection and crisis response, according to Reuters. This video can not be played Footage from Martinique shows early devastating winds AFP news agency said there were reports of flooding, mudslides and power outages in parts of St Lucia. Both places had their hurricane warnings downgraded to tropical storm watch. However, in this part of the world, the danger does not always pass when the hurricane moves on. Heavy rains mean mudslides can still be a risk. Some islands in Maria's path escaped the worst of Hurricane Irma and have been used as bases to distribute relief to places that were not so fortunate. Now there are concerns that that this work could be jeopardised if they are badly hit too. Puerto Ricans have been preparing in the capital, San Juan Guadeloupe has been a bridgehead for aid going to Irma-hit French territories, while Puerto Rico - which is expected to be hit later on Tuesday by Maria - has also been offering crucial assistance to its neighbours. Hurricane Irma's damage mapped Britain, France, the US and the Netherlands all have overseas territories in the Caribbean. The British government said more than 1,300 troops were staying put in the region and an additional military team had been deployed. A 42-strong military resilience team has also been deployed to the British Virgin Islands. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told AFP that 110 more soldiers would be sent to the region to reinforce about 3,000 people already there. Members of the US military are being evacuated from the US Virgin Islands ahead of Maria's arrival The Dutch navy tweeted that troops were heading to Saba and St Eustatius to bolster security, after St Martin - an island shared between France and the Netherlands - was hit by looting after the earlier hurricane. On Monday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the US territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, where the US military has been evacuating personnel.

"Toys 'R' Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada as it attempts to restructure its debts. The firm was once a dominant player in the US toy market, but has struggled against larger rivals such as Amazon. The move casts a shadow over the future of the company's nearly 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees. However, a US bankruptcy judge approved a loan of more than $2bn to help stabilise the toy chain. The aim is to give Toys 'R' Us money and time to prepare for the upcoming Christmas shopping season. The firm's European operations are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings and Toys R Us says it does not expect any immediate impact on its UK stores. Toys 'R' Us's operations in Australia, about 255 licensed stores and a joint venture partnership in Asia are also not included in the bankruptcy move. The bankruptcy filing is more evidence that traditional retailers are struggling in the US, as online retailers continue to capture market share. Toys 'R' Us said the majority of its stores around the world remained profitable, and would continue to operate as normal through the holiday period, which is when they do most of their business. But the company is also looking to online sales to secure its future, with recently launched web stores for its products. GlobalData Retail estimates that in 2016 about 13.7% of all toy sales were made online, up from 6.5% five years ago. ""The past decade has seen a dramatic change in the domestic toy market with new channels, increased competition, and new technology all having a deleterious impact on the sector and traditional toy stores. Unfortunately, Toys 'R' Us has not responded effectively to these challenges,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Gary Grant, founder of UK toy shop chain The Entertainer, said people's buying habits were changing. ""We're seeing it even in the supermarkets, where the big sheds aren't being visited as frequently as more convenient in-town locations,"" he told the BBC. ""So we're seeing in grocery the convenience stores are much more successful now than some of the over-spaced units that the grocers have."" 1948:  Charles Lazarus opens a baby furniture store in Washington, but quickly expands into toys 1957:  Inspired by early supermarkets, Mr Lazarus opens first Toys 'R' Us 1966:  Toys 'R' Us bought by Interstate Department Stores 1974:  Interstate Stores files for bankruptcy, Mr Lazarus returns 1978:  Toys 'R' Us sells shares on the stock exchange for first time 1980s: Period of rapid expansion in the US and overseas 1992:  President Bush opens first Toys 'R' Us in Japan 1994:  Mr Lazarus steps down as chairman and chief executive 2001:  Flagship store in New York's Times Square opened 2005:  Toys 'R' Us bought by private equity investors for $6.6bn 2012:  Sales peak at $13.9bn Toys 'R' Us wants to use the bankruptcy process to restructure and make the company viable over the long term. Enormous debt levels are its most immediate problem. Various lenders, including a JPMorgan-led bank syndicate and some of the company's existing lenders, have committed more than $3bn in new financing to turn the company around. ""A combination of high debt and severe structural changes in the industry created a toxic mix against which Toys 'R' Us had little choice but to restructure and try to put itself on a firmer footing,"" said Mr Saunders. However, the company says the new financing will improve the company's financial health and support its operations during the court-supervised bankruptcy process. ""Our objective is to work with our debt holders and other creditors to restructure the $5bn of long-term debt on our balance sheet, which will provide us with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business,"" said chief executive Dave Brandon.

"Sham (left) joined the Girl Guides 10 years ago and has been going to meetings throughout the Syrian war Sham thinks I should learn to milk a cow. Her new enthusiasm for farming bursts forth over a Skype call between London and Damascus, along with a loud and confident laugh. She has been to visit a farm with her local Girl Guide group in Syria. From Damascus and Hama to Aleppo and the seaside city of Latakia, through six years of war in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives and more than 12 million have been forced from their homes, the Girl Guides have continued. Women first started holding Guide meetings in Syria in the 1950s and they are being granted full membership of the movement's worldwide body this week. The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (Wagggs) praised the Syria groups' ""incredible work"" at giving their more than 1,000 members ""a sense of normality"" and ""a safe space to play and make friends"". ""Everyone thinks that we're all dying. Actually we are having a normal life,"" says Sham, a 22-year-old student who lives in Damascus, the capital. That might seem incongruous - Damascus has been rocked by suicide bombings and air strikes and has seen battles between rebels and the government. Why is there a war in Syria? But in any war the intensity of conflict depends on where you are. In government-held Damascus,cafes and markets have stayed openagainst a backdrop of shelling, even asother cities have been destroyed, displaced families have beenleft destitute, and millions more people have left Syria altogether. Living in a middle-class part of the capital, Sham knows how lucky she is. Girl Guide activities in Syria include singing songs, dancing, camping, and practical skills like first aid and changing tyres ""The war has taken its toll on my country, however, I am thankful it hasn't affected me in person,"" she says. ""Instead, it's made me stronger and helped me realise what I want to do in life. I know now that studying is the key to everything. ""Girl Guides has helped me no end and it's one of the reasons I consider myself successful. ""I am a part of the efforts of rebuilding Syria because I am a leader in the Scout movement."" From cooking to campaigning: Girl Guides modernise Sham even went to Sudan earlier this year to train Girl Guides there in body confidence. Since she took part in the scheme, she has stopped wearing make up altogether and wants other girls to feel proud of their bodies. Sham and Rim went to Sudan to deliver the Free Being Me body confidence programme While in the UK Guides have traditionally been associated with Christianity, Sham is a Sunni Muslim and says the members come from different religions and celebrate both Eid and Christmas together. ""No one would even ask"" her religion, she says. Girlguiding UK drop God vow from promise Girl Guides were banned in Syria in 1980 along with other youth organisations, as the ruling party tried to consolidate power. One woman, Rim, had been a member since she was six years old and the movement meant so much to her, she flouted the ban to hold meetings in a local church. Rim (L) has been a member of Girl Guides since she was six years old Girl Guides groups started to re-form in 2000 after the ban was lifted, and Rim is now a leader, a board member and a training co-ordinator. She says it has made her a ""strong, confident woman"" and she tries to pass that on to the girls in her charge by organising guest speakers including writers and businesswomen. ""Not only in Syria but in the Middle East women have not reached the position that they should be in yet,"" she says. ""The community still thinks that women cannot be decision makers or independent. It is hard to persuade people that even though I am a woman, I can still be a leader, a decision-maker and be able to create positive change. ""Girls are the key to our future. They are capable of amazing things."" ""On my honour, I promise that I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country, to help others and to obey the Girl Guide law."" Some of Rim's friends have died or had to leave, and she can no longer travel around the country to go hiking at the weekend as she used to. When the Girl Guides in Syria go camping, they have to check with the army beforehand that the area around their campsite is safe. And in such a divided country, it is difficult to be as inclusive as they might like. They operate in government-held areas. Their events use the national flag of Syria, the anthem and the national motto - contentious symbols all. Even the Syrian version of the promise - a pledge Girl Guides are invited to make when they join - mentions duty to one's country. It is not inconceivable that this would stop families who oppose the government of Bashar al-Assad from sending their daughters to meetings. Rim says that is not the case and some parents who ""object to"" the government do send their children. ""The Guides and Scouts is a movement that is not political,"" she says. ""The promise is promising for the country and not for a specific government. ""It is for the country. It is for Syria."" Sham agrees: ""We never talk about politics. It's open for everyone. Christians, Muslims, everyone."" Girl Guides are aged between five and 22 They started in 1909 in Britain as a girls' version of the Boy Scouts The Damascus unit meets once a week in the winter and three times a week in the summer Members can earn badges for new skills including learning an exercise, having an adventure or for learning facts Guides wear a uniform Associate members do not have voting rights at annual conferences of the movement; full members do Along with Syria, groups in Aruba, Azerbaijan and the Palestinian territories will become full members this week Guides plan huge overhaul of badges Has Girl Guiding stood the test of time?

"Toyota blazed a trail in hybrid car design with its Prius Are electric cars really about to take over from the old-fashioned internal combustion engine? Judging by some of the headlines we've seen recently, you could be forgiven for thinking petrol and diesel engines were about to be consigned to the scrap heap. Yet the reality is rather different. There is no question that the car industry is undergoing a radical change. At this year's Frankfurt Motor Show - currently under way in the German city - the buzzword throughout the cavernous exhibition halls has been ""electrification"". The day before the show, for example,Volkswagen said it would build electrified versionsof every model in its range - including those sold under the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands - by 2030. The same evening, Mercedes' parent company Daimler said it would have electrified versions of its own models by 2022. It's not just new cars, countries will need to invest in new infrastructures for fuelling electric vehicles Other companies, including Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda have made similar pledges. These are undoubtedly ambitious plans - but it is important to recognise their limitations. They are not saying they will get rid of diesel or petrol cars completely. They are simply promising to make electrified versions of them available. It is also important to recognise what ""electrified"" actually means. It can, of course, refer to fully electric battery powered vehicles. But it can also be used to describe hybrids - and hybrids come in many forms. A plug-in hybrid, for example, has a large battery capacity and is often capable of running entirely on electric power at least part of the time, though it will have a petrol engine as well. One type of plug-in hybrid, often referred to as a range-extended EV, is essentially an electric car with a small petrol engine that acts as an on-board generator. This video can not be played Mercedes unveils its F1-derived hybrid hypercar A strong or full hybrid, like the Toyota Prius, uses a relatively powerful electric motor alongside a conventional engine, but you don't need to plug it in for a recharge. A mild hybrid, meanwhile, is effectively a conventional car, equipped with a small electric motor that allows the engine to shut down temporarily when the car is stopped at traffic lights, for example. It can also be used to improve acceleration and power auxiliary systems. To fulfil their commitments, carmakers could simply offer a range of mild hybrids. They are cheaper to produce than full hybrids, yet they can offer significant benefits in terms of performance and fuel consumption. More and more cars are already being built in this way. Although their pledges may sound a bit more dramatic than they really are, it is true that carmakers are investing a great deal of money in new electric models. Volkswagen, for example, says that by 2025, one in four of its cars could be battery powered. BMW says it will be offering 12 pure-electric models by the same date. This video can not be played ""A hydrogen society needs to be created,"" says Toyota's Johan van Zyl So what is driving the move towards electric vehicles? There are several factors at play. The launch of the Tesla Model S in 2012 proved that electric cars could perform as well as their petrol equivalents and have a decent battery range, albeit at a high price. Since then the cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen significantly, while battery management technology has improved, making that kind of performance more affordable. Secondly, anti-pollution legislation is being tightened in key markets. Here in Europe, for example, there will be new limits in force for emissions of carbon dioxide from 2021. Those limits are much stricter than the current ones, and they are based on the average level of pollution produced by a manufacturer's entire fleet. From 2021 there will be new limits on carbon dioxide emissions in Europe So by producing zero-emissions cars, manufacturers will find it much easier to meet the targets. The same logic applies to building more hybrids. Both of these factors were already affecting the major manufacturers' long term thinking, when in September 2015, another factor came into play. The diesel emissions scandalcast an unwelcome spotlight on the industry - exposing not just sharp practice, but the fact that diesel cars in particular routinely produced far more harmful pollution than official figures would suggest. The result was a backlash from politicians and consumers - while Volkswagen, the architect of the scandal, tried to restore its reputation by becoming a leader in electric car technology. As the VW Group chief executive Matthias Mueller told me in Frankfurt: ""We've got the message of course. Consumers want clean vehicles. People want clean air, and we want to make our contribution."" This video can not be played VW is still having to deal with the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal Electrification was on the cards long before the VW scandal erupted. But the events of two years ago may well have helped to accelerate the process. Now, it seems that carmakers are making a virtue out of a necessity, trying to gain some useful PR mileage from a process that was, in reality, more or less inevitable. So, too, are politicians. Talk of banning petrol and diesel cars may sound dramatic, draconian even. But here in the UK, for example, the proposed ban doesn't cover hybrids. Industry experts say that by 2040 - the date when the ban is due to take effect - it is highly unlikely there will be any non-hybrid cars left on the market anyway. Then there is the question of infrastructure. How to make money the Instagram way Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? There are currently about 7,300 charging points for electric cars in the UK, and the number is increasing at a rate of about 10 per day, according to ZapMap. Globally, the figure is around two million, according to the International Energy Agency. Clearly, if millions of petrol and diesel cars are to be replaced by electric versions, then we will need a huge investment in charging infrastructure, or they won't be going anywhere. They will also need batteries - a lot of batteries. And the power to charge them has to be generated somewhere. That will take time and money. Meanwhile, hybrid cars offer a convenient and effective stop-gap. As BMW's chief executive Harald Krueger puts it, petrol and diesel cars ""are not dead yet"". ""You will see a transition time, with investments in combustion engines - petrol engines, diesel engines, very efficient engines,"" he says. ""But long term, we will see sustainable mobility with e-mobility."" Audi's Aicon autonomous electric concept - but will such concepts really become reality soon? VW Group's Matthias Mueller agrees. ""There will be a coexistence between internal combustion engines and electric drive systems for a certain period. I can't tell you how long that will be,"" he says. ""And that's because we do have to get the right infrastructure in place... we have to create the battery capacity. ""We're talking about enormous capacity here, and it has yet to be created.""

"Toy guns can lead to eye injuries, particularly if the bullets are hard and travel at speed Bullets from Nerf guns can cause serious eye injuries, doctors from a London eye hospital are warning. They treated three people with internal bleeding around the eye, pain and blurred vision after they were shot with the toy guns by children. Writing inBMJ Case reports,external, the doctors recommended wearing protective eye goggles and said the safe age limit for the guns may need to be reviewed. Hasbro warns players not to aim Nerf guns at the eyes or face. The company said its products had all gone through rigorous reviews and testing to assure they were safe and fun to play with. On its packaging, it also advises that only branded bullets designed for the product should be used. Nerf guns, made by Hasbro, are designed for children aged eight and over. The company also sells replacement bullets or darts - but cheaper versions are also available online from other retailers. Eye experts, from Accident & Emergency at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said the unlabelled bullet heads were harder and could potentially cause more damage - something that parents may not realise. Sarah Smith and her husband were ""messing around"" with their children's Nerf guns in January when he accidentally shot her in the eye at close range. She said the impact immediately caused the vision in her eye to ""go black"", as if someone had ""squirted black ink"" into it. ""It's excruciating pain and just really frightening because of the loss of vision,"" she said. ""I thought I'd lost my vision for good."" After about 20 minutes the vision returned but remained blurry with occasional ""flashes of light"". Sarah was taken to A&E the next day, where they told her she had suffered a flattened pupil. She said it took six months for her sight to return to normal. The guns are now locked away and can only be used by Sarah's sons, who are four and five, when they are supervised and wearing eyewear. ""They are dangerous. For children to use them they have to have goggles as well,"" Sarah added. Natalie Hearn-Smith's seven-year-old son was accidentally shot in the eye at ""point blank"" range by one of his friends. ""I heard his shrill scream, and I screamed and ran into the other room,"" Natalie said. ""I see him on the floor cowering, saying 'mummy, mummy, mummy, my eye...' ""He looked like he'd been 10 rounds in a fight. It was awful."" Natalie said her son had to have two appointments at a specialist eye hospital and then had to take antibiotic eye drops and cream. His eyesight has since returned to normal, but she has now banned the guns from her house. ""He has been very, very lucky."" In their report, they describe the injuries of two adults and a child in separate incidents linked to Nerf guns. One 32-year-old man was shot in the eye from eight metres away by a child with a Nerf gun. He suffered blurred vision and a red eye. A 43-year-old woman was shot in her right eye from a distance of one metre and complained of blurred vision and a red, sore eye. An 11-year-old child also suffered a shot in his right eye from a distance of two metres, and complained of pain and blurred vision. He developed swelling of the outer layer of the eye (cornea), and the inner layer of the eye (retina), from the force and speed of the bullet fired by the gun. All the patients were examined and treated with eye drops, the researchers said. Check-ups after a few weeks showed that their sight had returned to normal. While it was good news for the three patients, the doctors said that projectiles like Nerf gun bullets travelling at speed could cause long-term loss of vision. One patient told the doctors that there were ""numerous online videos which show children how to modify their guns to make them shoot harder, faster and further distance"". They added: ""This case series emphasises the seriousness of eye injury from Nerf gun projectiles and calls into consideration the need for protective eyewear with their use."" But they said more research was needed to find out if eye injuries were on the rise as a result of toy guns. The authors said they could not advise on a safe distance for shooting to avoid eye injuries on the basis of three patients. A statement from Hasbro said product safety was of ""utmost concern"" to the company. It said: ""NERF products are designed based on years of consumer insights and research, and undergo rigorous reviews and testing to assure that they are safe and fun to play with, and meet or exceed global standards and regulations. ""NERF foam darts and foam rounds are not hazardous when used properly. Consumers must never aim NERF blasters at a person's eyes or face, should only use the foam darts and foam rounds designed for specific NERF blasters, and never modify darts or blasters. ""There are darts available to buy claiming to be NERF compatible, however these darts are not NERF-branded and may not meet safety standards and regulations.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson ambushed by press pack Boris Johnson says the government is ""working together"" and that he will not be resigning after criticism of his intervention on Brexit. The foreign secretary has been accused of undermining Theresa May with a4,000-word article,externalsetting out his own post-EU vision. But he told journalists the government was ""a nest of singing birds"". Mr Johnson - along with other ministers - is due to attend the PM's Brexit speech in Florence on Friday. Asked about his article, Mrs May said she was ""getting on with the job"" of delivering Brexit. Is PM heading for 'Florentine fudge' in speech? May 'driving from the front' on Brexit What was behind Boris Johnson's Brexit article? Earlier the foreign secretary was accused by ex-chancellor Ken Clarke of making a pitch for a future Tory leadership election with his article. Mr Clarke said that ""in normal circumstances"" Mr Johnson would have been sacked. Some reports have claimed Mr Johnson will resign if his blueprint for Brexit is not followed. But speaking in New York, the foreign secretary said ""of course not"" when asked whether he was going to quit, and predicted the government would ""deliver a fantastic Brexit"". Asked whether there was a cabinet split on Europe, Mr Johnson said: ""No, we are a government working together. ""We are a nest of singing birds."" This video can not be played Theresa May asked about Johnson's intervention on Brexit Mr Johnson and Mrs May are both attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Asked repeatedly about Mr Johnson and reports of cabinet disunity over Brexit, the PM stressed that the government was united in trying to get the best possible deal. ""What I think the majority of the British public want to see is what we're doing, which is getting on with the job of those negotiations with the European Union and getting on with the job of the best deal for the UK,"" she told the BBC. Responding to questions about the so-called divorce bill for the UK to pay on leaving the EU, she said the UK was a ""law-abiding nation"" and would ""stand by our obligations"" as well as carrying on contributing to programmes it wants to be a part of after Brexit. Mr Johnson's article said the UK should not pay for access to the EU single market. This video can not be played Kenneth Clarke calls Boris Johnson's Brexit article an ""irrelevant nuisance"" on Radio 4's Today The continuing fallout from the article - published in Saturday's Telegraph - led, on Monday, to Mrs May having to rebut claims that Mr Johnson was trying to become a ""back-seat driver"" in her cabinet. The PM, who is due to set out her vision for Brexit in a speech in Florence on Friday, declared: ""This government is driven from the front."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said that in her speech Mrs May had to set out ""for the first time, really"" what the UK can ""can realistically achieve in negotiations"". That must include ""free access to the European market and no new barriers for our trade,"" he argued, and how best ""to avoid economic damage to the country"". ""Alongside that, personal publicity and campaigning by the foreign secretary is actually just an irrelevant nuisance."" This video can not be played Theresa May is making a big Brexit speech in Florence. But why do it there? Mr Clarke said: ""Sounding off personally in this way is totally unhelpful and he shouldn't exploit the fact she hasn't got a majority in Parliament. ""He knows perfectly well that normally the foreign secretary would be sacked for doing that - and she, unfortunately, after the general election, is not in the position easily to sack him - which he should stop exploiting."" He also attacked Mr Johnson for repeating ""one of the more simplistic and dishonest arguments of the hardline Leavers"" in his article - a reference to ""taking back control"" of Â£350m a week after Brexit. Mr Johnson met US President Donald Trump at the UN on Monday The foreign secretary said on Monday that his article was meant to be an ""opening drum roll"" for the PM's speech. ""Because I was involved in that Brexit campaign, people want to know where we are going,"" he added. Mrs May attempted to avoid a public row with her foreign secretary, telling reporters travelling with her on a trade mission to Canada: ""Boris is Boris."" Lord Hague is concerned about cabinet disunity over Brexit Former foreign secretary, Lord Hague,writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, warned that disunity over Brexit could hand power to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. He wrote: ""It is putting it a bit too politely to say, in the wake of Boris Johnson's article in this newspaper on Saturday, that the approach of senior ministers to the Brexit negotiations appears to lack co-ordination. ""More bluntly, it is now 15 months since the referendum, and high time that all members of the government were able to express themselves on this subject in the same way as each other, putting forward the same points, as part of an agreed plan.""

"Fully grown worms sit on the surface of the eye and cause irritation An eye infection caused by a parasitic worm increasingly common in mainland Europe could spread to the UK, pet owners are being warned. The disease,Thelazia callipaedaor oriental eye worm, is transmitted by a type of fruit-fly that lands on the eyes and deposits infective larvae. Cats, dogs and people catch it from the flies, which feed on eye secretions. There have been three recent canine cases reported in the UK, but the animals had been imported from abroad. One had been brought to the UK from Romania. The other two had recently travelled to mainland Europe with their owners. All made a full recovery following drug treatment and eye washes to flush out the adult worms. Britain has the same type of fruit-fly -Phortica variegata- and the concern is these could become infected and then spread the condition to people and animals in the UK, says veterinary expert John Graham-Brown, from Liverpool University, in the BMJ publicationVeterinary Record,external. Male drosophilid fruit-fly Phortica variegata can spread the infection to people and animals Mr Graham-Brown said there was no risk of people catching the infection directly from their pets. But dog owners should be on the lookout for signs of the infection in themselves and their pet if they had recently travelled to places where the disease was endemic. Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Belgium and Serbia have reported locally transmitted cases. Infected animals show a variety of symptoms, from mild conjunctivitis (pink eye) to severe corneal ulceration, which, if untreated, can lead to blindness. Fully grown adult worms might also be visible, but the microscopic larvae cannot be seen with the naked eye. Mr Graham-Brown said: ""So far, there has been only one strain of the infection round in Europe. But it's been spreading quite rapidly recently. We are not sure why. ""We do have this type of fly in the UK as well, so there is the potential for an infected dog to come back and give it to the fly here, and then it could spread.""

"Toyota blazed a trail in hybrid car design with its Prius Are electric cars really about to take over from the old-fashioned internal combustion engine? Judging by some of the headlines we've seen recently, you could be forgiven for thinking petrol and diesel engines were about to be consigned to the scrap heap. Yet the reality is rather different. There is no question that the car industry is undergoing a radical change. At this year's Frankfurt Motor Show - currently under way in the German city - the buzzword throughout the cavernous exhibition halls has been ""electrification"". The day before the show, for example,Volkswagen said it would build electrified versionsof every model in its range - including those sold under the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands - by 2030. The same evening, Mercedes' parent company Daimler said it would have electrified versions of its own models by 2022. It's not just new cars, countries will need to invest in new infrastructures for fuelling electric vehicles Other companies, including Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda have made similar pledges. These are undoubtedly ambitious plans - but it is important to recognise their limitations. They are not saying they will get rid of diesel or petrol cars completely. They are simply promising to make electrified versions of them available. It is also important to recognise what ""electrified"" actually means. It can, of course, refer to fully electric battery powered vehicles. But it can also be used to describe hybrids - and hybrids come in many forms. A plug-in hybrid, for example, has a large battery capacity and is often capable of running entirely on electric power at least part of the time, though it will have a petrol engine as well. One type of plug-in hybrid, often referred to as a range-extended EV, is essentially an electric car with a small petrol engine that acts as an on-board generator. This video can not be played Mercedes unveils its F1-derived hybrid hypercar A strong or full hybrid, like the Toyota Prius, uses a relatively powerful electric motor alongside a conventional engine, but you don't need to plug it in for a recharge. A mild hybrid, meanwhile, is effectively a conventional car, equipped with a small electric motor that allows the engine to shut down temporarily when the car is stopped at traffic lights, for example. It can also be used to improve acceleration and power auxiliary systems. To fulfil their commitments, carmakers could simply offer a range of mild hybrids. They are cheaper to produce than full hybrids, yet they can offer significant benefits in terms of performance and fuel consumption. More and more cars are already being built in this way. Although their pledges may sound a bit more dramatic than they really are, it is true that carmakers are investing a great deal of money in new electric models. Volkswagen, for example, says that by 2025, one in four of its cars could be battery powered. BMW says it will be offering 12 pure-electric models by the same date. This video can not be played ""A hydrogen society needs to be created,"" says Toyota's Johan van Zyl So what is driving the move towards electric vehicles? There are several factors at play. The launch of the Tesla Model S in 2012 proved that electric cars could perform as well as their petrol equivalents and have a decent battery range, albeit at a high price. Since then the cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen significantly, while battery management technology has improved, making that kind of performance more affordable. Secondly, anti-pollution legislation is being tightened in key markets. Here in Europe, for example, there will be new limits in force for emissions of carbon dioxide from 2021. Those limits are much stricter than the current ones, and they are based on the average level of pollution produced by a manufacturer's entire fleet. From 2021 there will be new limits on carbon dioxide emissions in Europe So by producing zero-emissions cars, manufacturers will find it much easier to meet the targets. The same logic applies to building more hybrids. Both of these factors were already affecting the major manufacturers' long term thinking, when in September 2015, another factor came into play. The diesel emissions scandalcast an unwelcome spotlight on the industry - exposing not just sharp practice, but the fact that diesel cars in particular routinely produced far more harmful pollution than official figures would suggest. The result was a backlash from politicians and consumers - while Volkswagen, the architect of the scandal, tried to restore its reputation by becoming a leader in electric car technology. As the VW Group chief executive Matthias Mueller told me in Frankfurt: ""We've got the message of course. Consumers want clean vehicles. People want clean air, and we want to make our contribution."" This video can not be played VW is still having to deal with the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal Electrification was on the cards long before the VW scandal erupted. But the events of two years ago may well have helped to accelerate the process. Now, it seems that carmakers are making a virtue out of a necessity, trying to gain some useful PR mileage from a process that was, in reality, more or less inevitable. So, too, are politicians. Talk of banning petrol and diesel cars may sound dramatic, draconian even. But here in the UK, for example, the proposed ban doesn't cover hybrids. Industry experts say that by 2040 - the date when the ban is due to take effect - it is highly unlikely there will be any non-hybrid cars left on the market anyway. Then there is the question of infrastructure. How to make money the Instagram way Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? There are currently about 7,300 charging points for electric cars in the UK, and the number is increasing at a rate of about 10 per day, according to ZapMap. Globally, the figure is around two million, according to the International Energy Agency. Clearly, if millions of petrol and diesel cars are to be replaced by electric versions, then we will need a huge investment in charging infrastructure, or they won't be going anywhere. They will also need batteries - a lot of batteries. And the power to charge them has to be generated somewhere. That will take time and money. Meanwhile, hybrid cars offer a convenient and effective stop-gap. As BMW's chief executive Harald Krueger puts it, petrol and diesel cars ""are not dead yet"". ""You will see a transition time, with investments in combustion engines - petrol engines, diesel engines, very efficient engines,"" he says. ""But long term, we will see sustainable mobility with e-mobility."" Audi's Aicon autonomous electric concept - but will such concepts really become reality soon? VW Group's Matthias Mueller agrees. ""There will be a coexistence between internal combustion engines and electric drive systems for a certain period. I can't tell you how long that will be,"" he says. ""And that's because we do have to get the right infrastructure in place... we have to create the battery capacity. ""We're talking about enormous capacity here, and it has yet to be created.""

"Judge Rinder is the latest Strictly participant to comment on the same-sex debate Strictly Come Dancing shouldn't have same-sex couples because it would ""politicise"" the show, according to former contestant Judge Rinder. ""Would it be a big step forward for the LGBTQI community if there were same-sex couples on Strictly? Do me a favour!"" he told the Radio Times. ""Some things ain't politics and Strictly is one of them."" The debate over whether gay contestants should dance with people of the same gender has been a talking point. Comedian Susan Calman said she received criticism on social media for taking part in the BBC One show because it doesn't have same-sex dancing couples. ""There will be a time for same-sex dancing,""she told the BBC.""I think what annoyed me slightly is that I seem to be getting it in the neck."" The judge turned TV personality danced with Oksana Platero last year The Reverend Richard Coles, another of this year's celebrity hopefuls, said he would be happy to dance with a man. Judge Craig Revel Horwood, meanwhile,has saidthere will ""probably"" be same-sex couples on next year's edition. According to Robert Rinder, however, a contestant's dance partner on Strictly should have nothing to do with sexual orientation. The criminal barrister turned daytime TV personality, who married his partner Seth Cummings in 2013,  danced with Ukrainian professional Oksana Platero on the show last year. ""One of the first questions I was asked when I joined Strictly Come Dancing last year was, 'Ooh, how come you're dancing with a woman?'"" he said. Susan Calman will dance with Kevin Clifton on this year's show ""The answer was always, 'What a thoroughly absurd question!' My sexuality, in terms of Strictly or whatever else I do in my life, ought to be as irrelevant as the length of my big toe. ""The reality is that ballroom dancing is a professional sport, and the dancers are athletes who have competed at the highest level. ""I soon realised that for Oksana it was like playing tennis at Wimbledon. And just like in tennis, there are ballroom championships and rankings. ""Nobody would dream of asking gay players in the mixed doubles to be partnered with someone of the same sex. The Reverend Richard Coles has been partnered with Australia's Dianne Buswell ""There are plenty of organisations making a real difference to the lives of gay people around the country that do need our help, so why undermine the wonder of Strictly by politicising it?"" That said, Judge Rinder said he would be prepared to dance with a male partner as a festive one-off. ""If it would satiate these Twitter trolls, I'll offer myself up to dance with a man on the Strictly Christmas special,"" he told the magazine. Meanwhile, gay MP Mhairi Black has backed the calls for same-sex couples on the show. ""It's about time big TV programmes are fully inclusive of LGBTI people,"" the SNP politician toldPink News.,external ""That includes having same-sex dance partners on Strictly - but the onus is on the programme-makers, not individual contestants.

"Parts of downtown Miami were under water Miami dodged much of Irma's wrath but the aftermath of the storm has been devastating for the city's poor. Tiffany Strong walks through the debris in the top floor of her house and sighs as she points to a stack of shoes in one of the rooms. Everything is drenched and neither she nor her two children can use them again. This has been their home for 12 years in Miami, but they can't go back. Heavy rains flooded the property on Sunday as Hurricane Irma hit the city. The winds caused the ceiling to collapse and now there is nothing but wet furniture and damaged walls everywhere. ""I don't even know where to begin. To come back to your house and see it like thisâ¦ it is devastating,"" says Strong, 42, who evacuated with her two children days before the storm hit. ""We don't have nothing. We don't even have any food. [What] I had got bad when the power was out."" Tiffany Strong's house Strong's life was already hard before Irma destroyed her house. She is one of 9,000 residents of the historically black neighbourhood of Overtown, one of the lowest-income areas of Miami. The average annual family income in this area is $15,280 (Â£11,300), while in Miami Dade County it is nearly $42,000, according to official figures. Overtown is just two miles away from downtown Miami, where high-rise luxury buildings look out to the bay and millions of tourists visit every year. But the landscape in this neighbourhood is very different, with ramshackle buildings, old cars and discount shops. Days after Hurricane Irma hit Florida, more than 300,000 homes remained without electricity in Miami Dade County, a densely populated area with 2.7 million inhabitants. Tiffany Strong says she has no food due to the power cuts Although Miami did not suffer the full wrath of a hurricane that devastated several Caribbean islands, there are communities like Overtown that are struggling to recover. Most of its residents didn't have money to buy food and water before the storm and the few supplies they had are now gone. It's the same situation in other vulnerable areas in metropolitan Miami, where more than 21% of the population lives in poverty, according a 2015 county report. Franklin Wright, 38, walked to a public school near his home to pick up three boxes full of US Army food rations. Streets in Miami were blocked by fallen trees More than a dozen schools have opened their doors since Thursday to distribute 30,000 meals. ""We will continue this operation until we run out of food. It's the right thing to do,"" says Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade public schools. Franklin Wright says he feels a sense of relief after finding food for his family. He didn't experience the chaos last week, when hundreds of thousands of Miami locals queued in supermarkets to buy as many supplies as they could. ""I just bought the minimum at the stores around the corner,"" he says. ""We were just hoping someone came here. We needed the help."" People wait for food at the public school For families with children, schools closed for over a week not only represented a pause in their children's education, but also in their nutrition. Many low-income parents count on free meals distributed in public schools to feed their children. One of them is Eve McKenzie, 30, who struggled before and after the hurricane to feed her seven children who live with her in northwest Miami. ""We survived the hurricane but I don't have money to feed my kids. I can barely pay for my bills,"" she says while asking three of her children to lift the boxes they just claimed at the school. Food distributed in Overtown school In another school in the mostly Latino neighbourhood of Hialeah, to the northwest of the city, breakfast meals ran out after just three hours on Thursday. ""We are planning on serving hot meals within the next days. People are really needed here,"" says the school principal, Nelson Gonzalez. Many Hispanics, a group which accounts for almost 68% of the total county population, face another concern besides electricity outages and home damages. Almost half a million Miami residents are also undocumented immigrants, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. Most are Hispanics. Ernesto Garcia, who asked for his real name not to be revealed, is originally from Nicaragua and has lived in Miami for the past 12 years as an undocumented immigrant. The construction worker didn't want to take risks in looking for assistance prior to the arrival of the storm. ""At first I thought of going to a shelter with my wife but then we got scared; there were rumours that they were taking people's fingerprints,"" he says. After the storm, Garcia avoided driving through highways in the city because he was afraid the police might pull him over and ask for a licence he doesn't have. For other families, the main difficulty now is to wait for the approval of federal money to fix their damaged homes. One of Ana Araica's rooms in her house in Allapattah, northwest of the city, was damaged by the storm, even though the family was in an area considered as low risk. Ana Araica withi her family ""The winds were so strong the roof went off and now you can't live in that bedroom,"" she says. Just days after Irma created a severe emergency in Miami, local authorities are taking actions to restore the power service and reopen schools for children. But more residents like Tiffany Strong and Ana Araica it will be far longer before they can return to their normal lives.

"Noma Dumezweni attended The Stage Debut Awards on Sunday Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is gearing up to transfer to Broadway after a hugely successful run in London's West End. Noma Dumezweni, who played Hermione in the original London production, is among the original cast members set to reprise her role across the Atlantic from March. The actress attended The Stage Debut Awards on Sunday and told BBC News that one of the aspects of Cursed Child she's most proud of is bringing theatre to a new audience. ""What I understood for London was that 60 or 65% of the audience were first-time theatregoers, because of those [Harry Potter] books,"" she said. ""And you go, OK, you've read the books, seen the films, and now I love that it's in script form - all those people with scripts of the Cursed Child will now go and play those parts in their garden. ""It's now there to create your version. So the through line is huge."" Noma starred alongside Paul Thornley and Cherrelle Skeete in Cursed Child Noma added that her 10-year-old daughter's enthusiasm for Harry Potter reassured her of the franchise's enduring popularity. ""To go to the theatre, with that percentage of people being first-time theatregoers, that's phenomenal, it's quite special and I'm part of it."" The actress said she has ""no idea"" whether changes will be made to the show ahead of its Broadway transfer, but added: ""I'm so excited for it."" Along with several members of the principal cast, Noma has now left the London production before she reprises her role in the US from March 2018. ""I went to see the new [London] cast, with Rakie Ayola playing Hermione, and I loved it,"" the actress said. Noma was one of the celebrity narrators on BBC Radio 2's 500 Words project ""I went, 'Oh my God they're doing their own thing', and within that there were little changes, and I thought, yes, that makes sense. ""And I said to Rakie, 'I'm totally stealing some of your stuff, because I really enjoy what you do'. But that's the highest compliment I can give her, as an actress to another actress, I love what she did."" Noma added that she may well make some changes of her own when she returns to the role next year. ""Hopefully there'll be room for us to expand. The first time I was at the Royal Shakespeare Company was to do The Winter's Tale, and I came back to it nine months later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The so-called Blue Whale challenge reportedly refers to the whales' habit of deliberately swimming to the shore to die The rumoured internet challenge known as Blue Whale, which has recently been allegedly linked to several suicides by teenagers and young men in India, has set off near panic in the country. Police have not confirmed any link with the deaths or even that ""Blue Whale"" exists, even though it has been mentioned in investigations into teenage suicides in a number of countries. The parents of some Indian children who killed themselves have since told reporters that they did so under its influence - also a charge that remains unconfirmed by police. Some internet experts evensuspectthat it is a hoax. The UK Safer Internet Centrehas called it,externala ""sensationalised fake news story"". But Indian media have widely reported on the alleged links, leaving authorities scrambling to cope and many people increasingly alarmed. Now the Supreme Court has even stepped in and is hearing a petition that calls for it be banned, if that's possible. Multiple high courts, state governments and authorities have already issued similar calls but they have not explained how they plan to enforce a ban. Meanwhile, the federal government has asked Facebook, Google, Instagram and Whatsapp to remove alleged ""links"" that reportedly lead to alleged Blue Whale groups or sites. But it is unclear how that can be done too. Schools have begun issuing warnings to students about its dangers, raising alarm among many parents - and feeding into the sense of hysteria. In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh authorities havebanned,externalsmartphones in schools, and one school in Punjab has asked its students to wear short-sleeved shirts so they can check for whale-shaped tattoos - alleged proof of participation. There is some confusion about the origins, but the title is believed to be a reference to an act carried out by some blue whales, who appear to beach themselves on purpose, causing them to die. The name is apparently being used by an alleged online pressure group, which is said to assign a curator to individual participants who then encourages them to complete tests over the course of 50 days. These assigned tasks reportedly escalate from straightforward demands such as watching a macabre video or horror film to something more sinister - even leading to suicide. Unfortunately it is not unusual for teenagers to be drawn to social media groups that ultimately have a detrimental effect on their mental health. The online group associated with the reports is said to have thousands of members and subscribers on Facebook and YouTube. The name has cropped up in countries including Russia, Ukraine, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. The first news reports linking it to suicides, which appeared in Russian media, have beendiscredited,external. Vkontakte, the Russian social network where it allegedly originated, said it had traced Blue Whale hashtags to ""tens of thousands of bots,external"". Blue Whale: Should you be worried about online pressure groups? Why are young Indians killing themselves? But with reports of alleged Blue Whale-related suicides appearing every day in the local media, Indian schools are taking no chances. ""My own notion about this is that it's just like drugs where even the first step is not to be taken,"" principal Rajiv Sharma told a roomful of 16-year-olds at his Spring Dale school in the northern state of Punjab. ""Remember just one mantra: nothing is more precious than life,"" he added. ""I got very scared... because something that can do this to you, you should not even try it, you should not try searching for it, you should try not even thinking about it,""  Shivram Rai Luthra, a student who attended Mr Sharma's talk, told BBC Hindi. But not everyone thinks that this is the best approach. ""Schools doing Blue Whale sessions are advertising for Blue Whale,"" Sunil Abraham, an internet researcher, told the BBC. Schools have been warning students about the rumoured challenge Why single it out, he asked, instead of talking about every internet-related concern from bullying online to sexting. ""We are going through a moral panic,"" he added. ""And the response seems to be moral education. It discounts the root cause of why people are suicidal."" A2012 studyshows that suicide is the second most common cause of death among India's youth. Added to that, very little is known about the suicides that have been linked to Blue Whale. The supposed links often boil down to alleged mentions of it on their Whatsapp chat groups and rumours of them having been glued to their phones in the weeks before they took their own lives. ""Nobody has looked at the histories of these kids,"" technology writer Mala Bhargava told the BBC. ""All we can really do is speculate away."" Concerns are growing over suspected links between teenage suicides and online groups Dr Achal Bhagat, a psychiatrist in Delhi, told the BBC he had not encountered a single Blue Whale case, although he speaks to young people every day. ""People join narratives to explain their experiences,"" said Dr Bhagat, adding that is possibly why some children have said they participated in the rumoured challenge despite there being no proof of its existence. Mental health in children, according to Dr Bhagat, is ""extremely neglected"" because India has no national programme to prevent suicide or even guidelines for improving mental health in schools. When you don't know how to talk to children every day, he added, how will you know how to communicate in a crisis? ""We all need to listen to children rather than telling them what not to do,"" Dr Bhagat said. Rather than obsessing about something that might not even exist, experts like Dr Bhagat wish the media and others would focus more on real mental health issues in young people. He advises parents that if they are concerned a teenager they know may be influenced by the alleged Blue Whale internet challenge or may require emotional support they should contact a mental health professional.

"This video can not be played Aung San Suu Kyi: 'We will accept refugees who want to return' Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said her government does not fear ""international scrutiny"" of its handling of the growing Rohingya crisis. It was her first address to the country about the violence in northern Rakhine state that has seen more than400,000 Rohingya Muslims cross into Bangladesh. Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism for her response to the crisis. She said there had been no ""clearance operations"" for two weeks. In her speech in English to Myanmar's parliament, Aung San Suu Kyi said she felt ""deeply"" for the suffering of ""all people"" in the conflict, and that Myanmar was ""committed to a sustainable solutionâ¦ for all communities in this state"". Ms Suu Kyi, who has decided not to attend the UN General Assembly in New York later this week, said she nevertheless wanted the international community to know what was being done by her government. Hours after her speech, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva called for full access to the region so it can investigate the situation ""with its own eyes"". Rakhine has faced unrest and sporadic violence for years, but the current crisis began in August with an armed attack on police posts which killed 12 people. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? That was blamed on a newly emerged militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa). The Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority, are denied citizenship and equal opportunities by the Myanmar government, which says they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They are largely despised by the wider Burmese majority-Buddhist population. Reality Check: Are Suu Kyi's Rohingya claims correct? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? BBC reporter tries to question Suu Kyi over crisis The attack led to a massive security crackdown by the military, which the UN's human rights chief later said seemed like a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Rohingya Muslims started leaving in vast numbers, crossing into Bangladesh with tales of their villages being burned and saying they were facing persecution at the hands of the military. Thousands of Rohingya had already fled to Bangladesh in recent years. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims had to decide what to bring and what to leave. Access is restricted to the area, but on a government-controlled trip for journalists the BBC found reason to question the official narrative that Muslims were setting fire to their own villages. Seeing through the official story in Myanmar How much power does Aung San Suu Kyi really have? The Myanmar government does not use the term Rohingya - calling the group Bengali Muslims instead - and Ms Suu Kyi did not do so in her speech. Delivering her address in a tone of measured defiance, she said she and her government ""condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence"". Among the key points: She did not address allegations against the military, saying only that there had been ""no armed clashes or clearance operations"" since 5 September. She said most Muslims had decided to stay in Rakhine and that indicated the situation may not be so severe. She said she wanted to speak to both Muslims who had fled and those who had stayed to find out what was at the root of the crisis. She said the government had made efforts in recent years to improve living conditions for the Muslims living in Rakhine: providing healthcare, education and infrastructure. She also said that all refugees in Bangladesh would be able to return after a process of verification. Ms Suu Kyi has overwhelming support in her home country, where she was a political prisoner for years before coming to power. But her speech has been criticised internationally for failing to address the allegations of abuse by the military. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in neighbouring Bangladesh, disputed the claim that there had been no clearance operations since 5 September, pointing out thathe had seen villages being burneddays after that date. This video can not be played Rohingya refugees say they would return to Myanmar if it was safe for them to be there Amnesty International said Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was ""burying her head in the sand"" by ignoring the abuses by the army. ""At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming,"" the rights group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific, James Gomes,said in a statement,external. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Nay Pyi Taw Aung San Suu Kyi is either completely out of touch or wilfully blind to the realities of what her army is up to. It is simply not credible to say we don't know why more than 400,000 Rohingya have fled.  The evidence is being gathered every day in the testimony of refugees. There were other moments that raised eyebrows. Like when she presented as good news the fact that more than half the Muslims in Rakhine haven't fled. Or when she said that there had been no clashes in Rakhine for the last two weeks. To say as she did that ""all people in Rakhine state have access to education and healthcare without discrimination"" is simply wrong. The Rohingya, particularly those in camps around Sittwe, have long been denied access to the most basic services, in particular healthcare. While Ms Suu Kyi is the de facto head of the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, it is the military which holds real power in Rakhine state as it is in charge of internal security. The Burmese military says its operations in the northern Rakhine state are aimed at rooting out militants, and has repeatedly denied targeting civilians.

"Toys 'R' Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada as it attempts to restructure its debts. The firm was once a dominant player in the US toy market, but has struggled against larger rivals such as Amazon. The move casts a shadow over the future of the company's nearly 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees. However, a US bankruptcy judge approved a loan of more than $2bn to help stabilise the toy chain. The aim is to give Toys 'R' Us money and time to prepare for the upcoming Christmas shopping season. The firm's European operations are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings and Toys R Us says it does not expect any immediate impact on its UK stores. Toys 'R' Us's operations in Australia, about 255 licensed stores and a joint venture partnership in Asia are also not included in the bankruptcy move. The bankruptcy filing is more evidence that traditional retailers are struggling in the US, as online retailers continue to capture market share. Toys 'R' Us said the majority of its stores around the world remained profitable, and would continue to operate as normal through the holiday period, which is when they do most of their business. But the company is also looking to online sales to secure its future, with recently launched web stores for its products. GlobalData Retail estimates that in 2016 about 13.7% of all toy sales were made online, up from 6.5% five years ago. ""The past decade has seen a dramatic change in the domestic toy market with new channels, increased competition, and new technology all having a deleterious impact on the sector and traditional toy stores. Unfortunately, Toys 'R' Us has not responded effectively to these challenges,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Gary Grant, founder of UK toy shop chain The Entertainer, said people's buying habits were changing. ""We're seeing it even in the supermarkets, where the big sheds aren't being visited as frequently as more convenient in-town locations,"" he told the BBC. ""So we're seeing in grocery the convenience stores are much more successful now than some of the over-spaced units that the grocers have."" 1948:  Charles Lazarus opens a baby furniture store in Washington, but quickly expands into toys 1957:  Inspired by early supermarkets, Mr Lazarus opens first Toys 'R' Us 1966:  Toys 'R' Us bought by Interstate Department Stores 1974:  Interstate Stores files for bankruptcy, Mr Lazarus returns 1978:  Toys 'R' Us sells shares on the stock exchange for first time 1980s: Period of rapid expansion in the US and overseas 1992:  President Bush opens first Toys 'R' Us in Japan 1994:  Mr Lazarus steps down as chairman and chief executive 2001:  Flagship store in New York's Times Square opened 2005:  Toys 'R' Us bought by private equity investors for $6.6bn 2012:  Sales peak at $13.9bn Toys 'R' Us wants to use the bankruptcy process to restructure and make the company viable over the long term. Enormous debt levels are its most immediate problem. Various lenders, including a JPMorgan-led bank syndicate and some of the company's existing lenders, have committed more than $3bn in new financing to turn the company around. ""A combination of high debt and severe structural changes in the industry created a toxic mix against which Toys 'R' Us had little choice but to restructure and try to put itself on a firmer footing,"" said Mr Saunders. However, the company says the new financing will improve the company's financial health and support its operations during the court-supervised bankruptcy process. ""Our objective is to work with our debt holders and other creditors to restructure the $5bn of long-term debt on our balance sheet, which will provide us with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business,"" said chief executive Dave Brandon.

"IS militants are moving to less well-known sites after being chased off mainstream social media Online jihadist propaganda attracts more clicks in the UK than any other country in Europe, a report has found. Britain is the fifth-biggest audience in the world for extremist content after Turkey, the US, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Policy Exchange'sstudy,externalsaid. The think tank suggested the UK public would support new laws criminalising reading content that glorifies terror. The governmenthas told internet companieslike Facebook and Google to do more to remove jihadist material. Former US military chief General David Petraeus, who wrote a foreword to the report, said efforts to combat online extremism were ""inadequate"". He said thebombing of a London Tubetrain last week ""merely underscored once again the ever-present nature of this threat."" ""There is no doubting the urgency of this matter,"" he said. ""The status quo clearly is unacceptable."" The report suggested new laws to criminalise the ""aggravated possession and/or persistent consumption"" of extremist ideology - but not to criminalise someone who ""stumbles across"" jihadist content. It said images of child abuse were approached in a similar way, with tougher penalties for the most serious cases. Under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000, it is currently an offence to possess information that could assist a would-be terrorist, but not material which glorifies terrorism. Policy Exchange surveyed 2,001 adults in the UK, finding 74% of people supported new laws to criminalise the ""persistent consumption"" of extremist material online. Its 130-page report found IS produces more than 100 new articles, videos and newspapers in a week - saying any decline of the terror group in the online space had been ""significantly overstated"". ""For at least a year, the production of content has continued despite the death of key figures, loss of territory and ongoing fighting,"" it said. The jihadist group hasretreated from territoriesit has seized in the Middle East, following pressure from a number of Iraqi and Syrian forces. IS, also known as Daesh, disseminated its online propaganda across a ""vast ecosystem"" of platforms, the report found - including file-sharing services, encrypted messaging platforms and social media websites, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter. Internet giants say they have madeefforts to clamp down on extremist content, with Google describing online extremism as a ""critical challenge for us all"". Facebook said it was working ""aggressively to remove terrorist content"" from its website, and had developed a shared industry database of ""hashes"" - unique digital footprints - which catalogues violent extremist videos or images. Twitter said that terrorist content had no place on its platform. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""We know that Daesh pose a threat online and this report helps to highlight the scale of the issue. ""I have made it crystal clear to internet bosses that they need to go further and faster to remove terrorist content from their websites and prevent it being uploaded in the first place."" The report suggested the UK government introduce a ""sliding scale"" of measures to bear down on internet companies - including giving the proposed newcommission for countering extremismpowers to oversee the removal of online content. Policy Exchange said 74% of Britons surveyed thought big internet companies should be more pro-active in locating and deleting extremist content. Martyn Frampton, Policy Exchange's co-head of security and extremism, said governments and security services were playing a ""fruitless game of whack-a-mole"" by focusing on removing individual pieces of content. ""If the internet companies won't do what their customers want and take more responsibility for removing this content, then government must take action through additional regulation and legislation,"" he said. Mrs Rudd added: ""The internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals, and industry need to ensure that the services they provide are not being exploited by those who wish to do us harm.""

"Fully grown worms sit on the surface of the eye and cause irritation An eye infection caused by a parasitic worm increasingly common in mainland Europe could spread to the UK, pet owners are being warned. The disease,Thelazia callipaedaor oriental eye worm, is transmitted by a type of fruit-fly that lands on the eyes and deposits infective larvae. Cats, dogs and people catch it from the flies, which feed on eye secretions. There have been three recent canine cases reported in the UK, but the animals had been imported from abroad. One had been brought to the UK from Romania. The other two had recently travelled to mainland Europe with their owners. All made a full recovery following drug treatment and eye washes to flush out the adult worms. Britain has the same type of fruit-fly -Phortica variegata- and the concern is these could become infected and then spread the condition to people and animals in the UK, says veterinary expert John Graham-Brown, from Liverpool University, in the BMJ publicationVeterinary Record,external. Male drosophilid fruit-fly Phortica variegata can spread the infection to people and animals Mr Graham-Brown said there was no risk of people catching the infection directly from their pets. But dog owners should be on the lookout for signs of the infection in themselves and their pet if they had recently travelled to places where the disease was endemic. Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Belgium and Serbia have reported locally transmitted cases. Infected animals show a variety of symptoms, from mild conjunctivitis (pink eye) to severe corneal ulceration, which, if untreated, can lead to blindness. Fully grown adult worms might also be visible, but the microscopic larvae cannot be seen with the naked eye. Mr Graham-Brown said: ""So far, there has been only one strain of the infection round in Europe. But it's been spreading quite rapidly recently. We are not sure why. ""We do have this type of fly in the UK as well, so there is the potential for an infected dog to come back and give it to the fly here, and then it could spread.""

"Taxpayers' money is being wasted on ""propping up rents"" in a ""failing housing market"", a report says. The National Housing Federation report highlights how money spent on housing benefit rose from Â£16.6bn in the mid-1990s to Â£25.1bn in 2015-16. It added that since 2011, no government money has been made available to build homes in England for low paid people to rent. The government said building more homes was its absolute priority. A Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) spokesman said it was continuing to work closely with the sector. But the report from the federation, which represents housing associations and social landlords, says housing someone in a private rented property costs Â£21 a week more than housing them in a social rent property, on average. Its chief executive David Orr said this was ""poor value for the taxpayer"" and had ""a knock-on effect, with everyone struggling to rent or buy"". ""We know we need more, better quality social housing. And yet, rather than putting public money into building the homes we need, we are propping up rents in a failing market."" The country could do better, he said, as he prepared for his organisation's annual conference in Birmingham. He added that he thought that Prime Minister Theresa May was right to say, in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, that social housing had been neglected and needed attention. After this tragedy, the crisis in social housing could no longer be ignored, he said. ""The government must be bold and make a break with the past by making money available to build genuinely affordable homes,"" Mr Orr said. The report pointed out that after the government decided to halt the funding of social rented housing in 2011, the building of such properties fell from 36,000 to 3,000 the next year. This was despite the fact that there are more than a million families on housing waiting lists, the report said. The report concluded: ""Not only is it more expensive to house someone in the private rented sector than social housing, but none of that money increases the supply of new homes. ""Social landlords do reinvest in new homes, building a third of all new homes last year including for social rent from their own funds, but the same does not happen in the private rented sector."" A DCLG spokesman said: ""We introduced Affordable Rent in 2012 to maximise government investment and build more homes for below market rent. ""We've already delivered nearly 333,000 affordable homes since 2010 and have announced an additional Â£1.4bn for our Affordable Homes Programme, increasing the total investment to Â£7.1bn."" Affordable rented housing is defined as 80% of the market rent, while social rent is defined as 60% of the market rent. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, said the failure of successive governments to build enough social housing was ""no secret"". ""The whole reason the government is having to offer housing benefit is precisely because we haven't built enough social housing,"" she said. ""The solution in the long term is to build more affordable accommodation, but in the meantime we must maintain housing benefit to give desperate families the help they need. ""With party conference season upon us, we're calling on politicians across all the major parties to commit to ending the freeze on housing benefit which is pushing thousands of families to the brink of homelessness.""

"This video can not be played Aung San Suu Kyi: 'We will accept refugees who want to return' Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said her government does not fear ""international scrutiny"" of its handling of the growing Rohingya crisis. It was her first address to the country about the violence in northern Rakhine state that has seen more than400,000 Rohingya Muslims cross into Bangladesh. Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism for her response to the crisis. She said there had been no ""clearance operations"" for two weeks. In her speech in English to Myanmar's parliament, Aung San Suu Kyi said she felt ""deeply"" for the suffering of ""all people"" in the conflict, and that Myanmar was ""committed to a sustainable solutionâ¦ for all communities in this state"". Ms Suu Kyi, who has decided not to attend the UN General Assembly in New York later this week, said she nevertheless wanted the international community to know what was being done by her government. Hours after her speech, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva called for full access to the region so it can investigate the situation ""with its own eyes"". Rakhine has faced unrest and sporadic violence for years, but the current crisis began in August with an armed attack on police posts which killed 12 people. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? That was blamed on a newly emerged militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa). The Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority, are denied citizenship and equal opportunities by the Myanmar government, which says they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They are largely despised by the wider Burmese majority-Buddhist population. Reality Check: Are Suu Kyi's Rohingya claims correct? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? BBC reporter tries to question Suu Kyi over crisis The attack led to a massive security crackdown by the military, which the UN's human rights chief later said seemed like a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Rohingya Muslims started leaving in vast numbers, crossing into Bangladesh with tales of their villages being burned and saying they were facing persecution at the hands of the military. Thousands of Rohingya had already fled to Bangladesh in recent years. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims had to decide what to bring and what to leave. Access is restricted to the area, but on a government-controlled trip for journalists the BBC found reason to question the official narrative that Muslims were setting fire to their own villages. Seeing through the official story in Myanmar How much power does Aung San Suu Kyi really have? The Myanmar government does not use the term Rohingya - calling the group Bengali Muslims instead - and Ms Suu Kyi did not do so in her speech. Delivering her address in a tone of measured defiance, she said she and her government ""condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence"". Among the key points: She did not address allegations against the military, saying only that there had been ""no armed clashes or clearance operations"" since 5 September. She said most Muslims had decided to stay in Rakhine and that indicated the situation may not be so severe. She said she wanted to speak to both Muslims who had fled and those who had stayed to find out what was at the root of the crisis. She said the government had made efforts in recent years to improve living conditions for the Muslims living in Rakhine: providing healthcare, education and infrastructure. She also said that all refugees in Bangladesh would be able to return after a process of verification. Ms Suu Kyi has overwhelming support in her home country, where she was a political prisoner for years before coming to power. But her speech has been criticised internationally for failing to address the allegations of abuse by the military. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in neighbouring Bangladesh, disputed the claim that there had been no clearance operations since 5 September, pointing out thathe had seen villages being burneddays after that date. This video can not be played Rohingya refugees say they would return to Myanmar if it was safe for them to be there Amnesty International said Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was ""burying her head in the sand"" by ignoring the abuses by the army. ""At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming,"" the rights group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific, James Gomes,said in a statement,external. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Nay Pyi Taw Aung San Suu Kyi is either completely out of touch or wilfully blind to the realities of what her army is up to. It is simply not credible to say we don't know why more than 400,000 Rohingya have fled.  The evidence is being gathered every day in the testimony of refugees. There were other moments that raised eyebrows. Like when she presented as good news the fact that more than half the Muslims in Rakhine haven't fled. Or when she said that there had been no clashes in Rakhine for the last two weeks. To say as she did that ""all people in Rakhine state have access to education and healthcare without discrimination"" is simply wrong. The Rohingya, particularly those in camps around Sittwe, have long been denied access to the most basic services, in particular healthcare. While Ms Suu Kyi is the de facto head of the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, it is the military which holds real power in Rakhine state as it is in charge of internal security. The Burmese military says its operations in the northern Rakhine state are aimed at rooting out militants, and has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Ms Suu Kyi has previously said the narrative was being distorted by a""huge iceberg of misinformation""and said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorist.
