"This video can not be played 'Why I quit my dream job as a police detective' The lack of police investigators in the UK is in crisis, according to a new report. Former detectives have told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme why they have quit their jobs. Being a police officer was Angelina Dawson's dream job. It was ""all I ever wanted to do"", she says. A police officer who won commendations, she was ""dead chuffed"" when she finally became a detective helping to solve some of London's most serious crimes. ""I loved the challenge of trying to work out what happened and putting the pieces of the puzzle together and getting the result, getting to court when people are being convicted of terrible things,"" she says. ""You really feel you've made a difference. It was worth all of those long hours."" However, in February - after 10 years as a Metropolitan Police officer and having become a detective - she decided to walk away from the police. ""I decided it's not good for me, it's not good for my health. It is so pressurised now. There just isn't enough of us,"" she says. A shortage of detectives in the force meant some officers were having to investigate up to 20 crimes at once, she says. Angelina at her passing out parade, in 2007 ""That is a massive workload, that's a minimum of 20 victims, a minimum of 20 suspects,"" she says. ""There just isn't enough hours in a day to do everything."" Eventually, she says, the job began to harm her health, at which point she decided to leave it behind, albeit with a heavy heart. ""I would often wake up with headaches because I wasn't having enough sleep,"" she says. ""No matter how much you try to be organised at work and keep on top of everything, there was just more and more and more and there just wasn't enough of us to cope with what was coming in. ""I just ended up thinking I can't do this anymore. It made me feel a bit of a failure to be honest, that I couldn't stick at it. It made me sad."" Simon Davison says he quit the police rather than move to another team for a promotion Simon Davison, another former Met Police detective, says the workload in some CID units in the capital had become ""insurmountable"" before he left. Last month, he resigned as a detective in the Met's ""flying squad"" - a unit that investigates serious organised crime. He says he would have had to move away from his specialist unit in order to win a promotion. However, he took the decision to quit the force altogether rather than transfer to one of London's 32 borough constabularies, where he says numbers have been ""decimated"". ""They've often got one detective sergeant and a trainee detective and that's it for the borough,"" he says. ""It only takes a couple of serious incidents and they are completely stretched. ""So I certainly noticed that going into the CID offices, that they just had very few numbers and you could sense the morale was quite down."" The seemingly glamorous lure of becoming a police detective and catching some of London's most fearsome criminals has also diminished, according to Mr Davison. ""The mystique of the CID has gone,"" he says. ""It used to be something that you aspired to but now I think something where you are either put or it is seen as the easy way out. ""I've seen departments with very few people. ""The experience has gone, and they just have an insurmountable work load."" The Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report on police effectiveness describes the shortage of investigators - including detectives - as a ""national crisis"", calling for a UK-wide response. ""Some crimes are apparently being shelved without proper investigations taking place,"" the report says. Inspectors say the Met Police is currently short of 700 detectives, and they are ""very concerned"" that too often officers without the right skills and experience are investigating crimes. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file police officers, says the overall number of officers in London has not reduced. Instead, the organisation says, cuts to civilian staff numbers have piled more pressure on officers, while there are also fewer people coming forward to join CID. It is urging forces to make the role of a detective constable more appealing. The Met said in a statement that ""detective recruitment and retention is being addressed as a priority"". ""In an organisation as large and complex as ours, ensuring we have the right people in the right roles to deal with an ever changing pattern of demand will always be very challenging, even more so in the current financial climate,"" the force said. It added: ""The Met has more officers than ever before taking the detective exam."" The Home Office said in a statement: ""We have protected police funding through the 2015 Spending Review, and the public should be in no doubt that forces will continue to have the resources they need to cut crime and keep our communities safe.""

"The claim:Failing police forces have ""no excuse"" because their budgets have been protected. Reality Check verdict:Overall the police budget in England and Wales has been protected in real terms, but not every individual force will feel the benefit because the money is being targeted at specialist areas of policing. This relatively small funding boost comes off the back of five years of deep cuts. In 2015, the government announced that overall police budgets would be protected. This meant the amount of money the police receive from the government would increase each year in line with inflation for the following five years. The Minister for Policing, Brandon Lewis, flagged this in response toa report,externalby the independent inspector of police forces, which found a ""worrying"" variation in the quality of policing across England and Wales, despite improvements overall. Police funding in Scotland is devolved and Northern Ireland has different funding arrangements so they were not included in the report. The report  was compiled by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and Mr Lewis said: ""This Government has protected police funding, through the 2015 Spending Review. ""There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations - those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take HMIC's findings very seriously and I expect to see rapid improvements."" The inspectorate had warned that some police forces were ""struggling to respond to shrinking resources"". It is true to say that the overall policing budget was protected in real terms in 2015 but this figure disguises some regional variation. Part of the Â£900m extra funding over the following five years is going on specific areas of policing like cybercrime and tackling child sexual exploitation which are often dealt with regionally, so not every individual force will see the benefit of this uplift. A Home Office statement at the time of the announcement said that it would provide funding to maintain individual police force budgets at current cash levels. Not every police force will necessarily receive enough money to keep up with inflation. Spending on policing had been rising steadily for at least 15 years until austerity cuts began to kick in from 2010. It rose particularly rapidly in the 10 years to this date, going up by more than 30%. Following the 2008 crash and the swathe of cuts to public spending that followed, the part of police forces' budgets that are paid for by central government shrunk by 22% on average. Before the 2015 announcement there was already regional variation. This is in large part because of the two main ways policing is funded: through a grant from central government and council tax. Different areas rely to different extents on the central government grant; for example last year Northumbria and the West Midlands police forces raised 12% of their revenue through council tax while Surrey raised almost half (49%) of its revenue in this way. This often corresponds to how well-off an area is - generally poorer areas have lower tax takes and rely more on government grants. As these grants have reduced, a larger proportion of budgets is coming from council tax. Since the grant was cut by the same percentage around the country, areas that lean most heavily on central government money, and are the least able to raise money through council tax, will have felt those cuts most sharply. You can see this in the real-termreductions to funding,externalin different police forces. Between 2010 and 2016 Northumbria suffered a 23% cut while in Surrey it was only 12%. The areas that raised funding by the smallest amount during the previous good years have also experienced the biggest cuts in the lean years. However, it is also worth noting that the variation in quality raised in the HMIC report does not correspond directly to how much budgets have been cut. Bedfordshire, the only force to be rated inadequate, experienced a cut over the last five years that was about average for the country - a 17% fall compared with a fall of 18% across England and Wales. Durham, the only force to be rated outstanding, suffered an above average 20% cut. Of course, simply comparing budget cuts to performance does not take account of demographic differences and crime levels. So while it is true to say that policing is being protected at least to some extent, this comes off the back of five years of deep cuts - cuts which feel larger relative to large increases in spending in the preceding years.

"Travel experts began warning even before the 2016 election that Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric could cause a decline in tourism. So has the so-called ""Trump slump"" arrived? Stephen Mumford, a professor of metaphysics at Durham University in north-east England, had some money to burn thanks to a large research fellowship grant he was awarded in October 2016. Always eager to travel to other countries and present his research, he began making arrangements for trips to several academic conferences in the United States. Then Donald Trump won the November 2016 election. In his first month in office, the Trump administration imposed a travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries, and empowered US Customs and Border Protection agents to enforce immigration laws more assertively at ports of entry. This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Mumford started to hear stories he didn't like - like the British Muslim school teacher who was separated from his students andremoved from a flightbound for the US, or that incoming travellers were being asked to turn over their mobile phones and social media passwords. Last month, Mumford made what he says was a difficult decision: to cancel all his planned travel to the US. ""I don't want to go to a conference if other people are excluded simply because they belong to a particular group,"" he says. ""I don't feel I can just walk in and think, 'I'm OK', and forget the guy behind me can't come in just because he's a Muslim. That's being a party to the unfairness."" Mumford is not alone. Thousands of professors,externalaround the globe have pledged not to travel to the US. A growing list,externalof Canadian schools who once made regular trips across the border for sports, music and other educational events are cancelling their journeys for fear that foreign-born students could be singled out. In Philadelphia, at least one large conference worth an estimated $7m in revenue to the cityhas been cancelled,external, and the tourism board of New York City recently reversed its pre-election projection that the city would see an increase of 400,000 international travellers in 2017. Theboard now predicts,external300,000 fewer foreign tourists will visit the Big Apple this year than did in 2016. Anecdotes like these are the worst fears of travel industry analysts, who've been warning for weeks that the US could be entering a tourism ""Trump slump"". The online booking site Kayak reported that searches by UK citizens for US destinations had""fallen off a cliff"",external, and that hotel prices in cities like San Francisco, New York and Las Vegas dropped between 32-39%. Hopper, another travel site, released data showing that searches for flights to America had dropped globallyan average of 22%,external. By contrast, the online travel agent site Tripsta reported a spike in one-way flights from the UK to the US in January and February of 2017, but hypothesised the cause could be ""the return of non-US nationals concerned about restrictions to international travel"". The Global Business Travel Association estimated that for the week Trump's travel ban was in effect, the US lost$185m in travel bookings,external(Â£150m). A Syrian refugee family who was previously banned by Trump's executive order celebrate their entry into the US But the president can't shoulder all the blame. Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, characterises the slowing of tourism interest as a ""trifecta of travel hindrances"": a weak global economy, a strong US dollar and the ""falling favourability"" of the US in the eyes of the international community. International travel wasalready down in 2016,externalby about 0.9% compared to 2015. Travel to the US from Canada was down 1.4% in December 2016 compared to the previous month, but overall, 2016 was the third consecutive year thatfewer Canadians went to the States,external. ""We expected 2017 to be a fairly subpar year in any case - very modest growth,"" he says. ""[But] this couldn't come at a worse time. ""The US is an expensive destination, we have a muted global economy and now we pile this on - that's why the impacts are as significant as they are."" His firm projects a loss of 6.3 million visitors by next year, which translates into $10.8bn in lost revenue, including what Sacks calls ""Trump-induced"" losses. Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with the Atmosphere Research Group, says the US tourism industry has probably already bounced back from the immediate impact of the blocked travel ban. However, industry insiders are anxiously awaiting the language of the new executive order to replace it. ""There are a lot of unknowns. The travel industry, which is already a discretionary industry, hates uncertainty,"" he says. This video can not be played Iraqi Fuad Suleman, who was turned back in Cairo, says he and his family had been preparing to emigrate to the US for two years Harteveldt points to a survey his firm conducted weeks before the executive order took place, which showed that in 15 countries around the world about 20% of the respondents reported that as a result of the presidential election they were either somewhat or highly unlikely to travel to the US or had actually cancelled a planned trip. ""The fact that in 15 countries so many people had either cancelled trips or had such an unfavourable view of the United States was really alarming to me as an analyst,"" he says. ""Events that transpired during the presidential election just created a very bad impression of the US in many people's minds."" Trump's travel ban inspired protests around the globe, including this one in London Lori, a mother of two boys in Edmonton, Alberta, says they used to make regular trips to the Twin Cities in Minnesota. After Trump's executive orders on immigration, her sons urged her to cancel a trip in March. ""For our oldest, it was out of outrage: the majority of his friends are either visible minority immigrants/refugees, or the children of immigrants or refugees; some of them are Muslim,"" she wrote in an email. ""For our 11 year old, it was fear: he equates the word 'America' with violence and discrimination against innocent people now."" Although some of the frenzy over President Trump may cool in the coming months, Sacks says that international travellers are booking their spring and summer holidays now. ""This is a massive negative economic impact that's at stake here. It will result in appreciable declines in tax revenues, and will affect household income and also employment and profitability for the industry,"" he says. ""It will hurt."" How much it will hurt will be more apparent later, once the high travel seasons of spring and summer arrive, and after publicly held airlines, hotels and travel agencies file their earnings reports in mid-April. The US government also has not yet released this year's visa-entry figures, which will also reveal more about how travel has been affected. Mumford says that though his decision not to attend a prestigious conference in California could hurt him professionally, he can't put aside his unease over the changes he sees happening in the US. ""I've got the travel money, and if I'm not wanted or regarded suspiciously, then I'll go elsewhere,"" he says. ""I feel I'm showing solidarity with my friends in America by this minor protest.""

"After a week ofelaborate teases, pop star Lorde has finally unveiled her long-awaited new single, Green Light. Inspired by a heartbreak, it juxtaposes downbeat lyrics with a euphoric chorus, over a driving percussion loop. The song received its first play on BBC Radio 1, where Mistajam made it hishottest record in the world. It's Lorde's first new material since the Disclosure collaboration Magnets in 2015 and precedes her second album, which is due later this year. ""Finally! It's only been three years, huh?"" she told Radio 1. Here's all you need to know about the song - and Lorde's new album. Lorde paid tribute to David Bowie at last year's Brits, backed by many of the star's former band David Bowie believed the Lorde was ""the future of music"" - which is why the singer was chosen to pay tribute to him at last year's Brit Awards. Going back to the studio after that performance, she said his spirit informed her writing. ""I feel like the whole time spent writing this record, I've had him in my thoughts, I've had him in my heart,"" she told Mistajam. ""It's hard not to make something and not think, 'What would David think of this? If I could play it to him, what would he say?'"" Fittingly, portions of Lorde's album were recorded in New York's Electric Lady studios, where Bowie wrote Fame and recorded his swansong, Blackstar. ""I am so proud of this song,""wrote Lorde on Twitter,external. ""It's very different, and kinda unexpected. It's complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE."" ""It's the first chapter of a story I'm gonna tell you. The story of the last two wild, fluorescent years of my life. ""This is where we begin."" Lorde's debut album, Pure Heroine, was released in 2013 Lorde told Mistajam that Green Light was ""about me trying to figure out how to put myself back together"" after her first significant heartbreak. It opens on a sombre note, as Lorde recalls the beginning (or end?) of her relationship. ""I do my makeup in somebody else's car,"" she sings over a minor key piano. ""We ordered different drinks at the same bar."" ""Did it frighten you, how we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor?"" But Lorde goes on to call her lover a ""liar"", practically spitting the line: ""Those rumours they have big teeth, they bite you."" As she ramps up towards the hook, she's getting ready to pack her belongings - while admitting she's finding it hard to finally make the break. ""I wish... I could just let go,"" she sings as, in the background, a chorus of cheerleaders chant: ""I'm waiting for it, that green light. I want it."" The green light is a recurring theme in F Scott Firzgerald's The Great Gatsby, signifying the elusive promise of the future. Lorde may be referring to that or, more simply, a green light giving her permission to move on with her life. Structurally and thematically complex, Green Light isn't as immediate as previous Lorde singles like Royals and Yellow Flicker Beat. In particular, there's an awkward gear change from the haunting, dramatic verses into the choppy, beat-driven chorus. But in common with one of the year's other great pop comebacks - Katy Perry's Chained To The Rhythm - the song rewards repeated listens. Thecathartic music video,external, directed by Grant Singer and featuring Lorde dancing in strobing green lights and on car roof-tops, helps give the song some context, too. Lorde's spent last year working on her new album with US musician Jack Antonoff. You might know him as a member of the group .fun,  the band behind the 2011 smashWe Are Young,external. You might also know him as the boyfriend of Girls creator Lena Dunham; as the co-writer of three songs on Taylor Swift's synthpop opus 1989 - or even through his solo project, Bleachers. Either way, Green Light (along with most of Lorde's new material) was recorded in his home studio in Brooklyn, as pictured inthis Instagram shot,external. ""We worked out of the house for the better part of a year, in this tiny little room covered in bizarre animal wall paper,"" she said. From the teenagers who hid in the school toilets to hear the song premiere, to the fan who wrote ""this was worth the million year wait"", it's fair to characterise the reaction as ""broadly positive"". The star was just 16 when her debut album was released Last year, Lordescolded,externalan impatient fan who said he was ""giving up"" on the chances of hearing a follow-up to her debut album, Pure Heroine. Speaking to Mistajam, she explained the extended break had been necessary. ""I needed to just go away, go home to New Zealand, and hang out by myself and figure out what I was going to do next. I knew I couldn't make the same thing again, and I had to figure out what it was that I wanted to say. And I'm so glad I took that time, because this record is the coolest thing I've ever made."" Lorde revealed the cover art on her Twitter feed Earlier this week, eagle-eyed fans spotted the cryptic message ""M*******A"" in the title bar of Lorde's website. They guessed, correctly, that this was a hint about her album title... with possible names including Macadamia (?), Mona Lisa or Musomania (an obsession with music). But she's since revealed the record will be called Melodrama. ""I wrote this album about this crazy year of my life,"" she explained. ""I partied a lot and I felt all the feelings - and it was all so fluorescent. So I decided to call the album Melodrama."" ""This is as pop-dance as it gets,"" she told Mistajam. ""We were just in the studio, mashing around on the piano and... that's what it is."" ""We didn't turn it into the single, it was just born that way."" The 20-year-old added the new album was more varied than her debut. ""There's a lot of beats again but there's also instruments that are going to surprise people."" Fans have been chomping at the bit for Lorde's new album Asked if she'd be visiting Worthy Farm this June, Lorde replied: ""You know, farms are cool. I love farms. I'm a big fan of farms. So who knows?"" Lorde's biggest single to date, Royals, won two Grammy awards in 2014 A week into Donald Trump's presidency, Lorde posted a link to the album Sweet Sexy Savage, by US R&B singer Kehlani. ""After a horrifying, anxiety-inducing week of news, music like this allows much needed catharsis,"" she wrote. ""I truly believe in the necessity of cathartic pop records in times like these. ""I love the big sprawling projects too, but there's something about the falls & lifts of meticulous pop, moments designed for u to feel what u need to, that's more important than ever. ""You're probably guessing what kind of record I've made based on these tweets."" We can't wait.

"Gordon Brown has called for the second part of the Leveson Inquiry to go ahead - and said the majority of press abuses in recent years were from the Murdoch press. Speaking to the former prime minister forThursday's BBC News at Ten,I asked him why we need it, given the criminal trials that followed the first part and high cost to the public. ""There are so many unanswered questions about what the Murdoch News International group didâ¦ blagging, impersonation, email interception, breaches under the law itself... that unless there is a full and proper inquiry we'll never be able to clear the air,"" he said. ""And we'll always have suspicions about how the media was acting for a whole decade at the start of the 21st century."" Leveson Inquiry findings: At-a-glance Q&A: Leveson Inquiry Labour demands Leveson part two goes ahead As things stand, there is a judicial review into the terms of a government consultation into both whether the second part of Leveson should happen and also if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (which imposes costs of legal actions against publishers on to those publishers if they don't sign up to an approved regulator) should be implemented. The second Leveson Inquiry was to look specifically at allegations of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within the media, Most of the people I speak to in Westminster think it is unlikely that a government so focused on leaving the European Union will want the distraction of another inquiry. For Brown, that is not good enough - and the fact that David Cameron promised it would happen counts for plenty. Lord Justice Leveson recommended new press regulation ""Leveson himself said this was only the first part of his inquiry, Mr Cameron when prime minister said there had to be a Leveson Two, the House of Lords has looked at this and agreed there has to be a second inquiry,"" he said. ""Mr Cameron said that was to happen when he was prime minister. It does seem strange that we're now not going to have it unless we keep pushing for it. ""Leveson One could only deal with part of the problem. The whole of the problem has to be dealt with, including the way Murdoch newspapers impersonated people, including the way there were breaches of the law, including also how email interception might have happened, as well as telephone interception. And the media itself should want an inquiry to clear the air."" Brown believes there is fresh evidence that has not been sufficiently raked over. And it was clear in speaking to him how personally he was affected by press intrusion. ""There is fresh evidence. We have theDaniel Morgan murder inquiryand that is revealing fresh evidence almost every month. We have the statements made by people who were in police at the time that have been sent to [Culture Secretary] Karen Bradley as a reason for taking action. ""We have the evidence that people like me have that I was impersonated, that my bank account was broken into, that my lawyer's office was besieged by calls impersonating me from the Murdoch newspapers. ""These are all things that happened and have not been properly accounted for by the Murdoch empire."" I asked Brown whether, as many of his critics contend, this was really the vendetta of a wronged man. His response was: ""I can only explain what happened to me. I know I was impersonated. My lawyer's office received questions by impersonation. My bank accounts and mortgage accounts were broken into. ""I am in a position to defend myself. There are thousands who don't know what happened to them. People who have less power to defend themselves than me deserve this inquiry."" Murdoch, with whom Brown was thought at one point to have developed a trustful relationship, deserted Labour at the 2010 election, endorsing the Conservatives in a manner timed to inflict maximum damage on Brown's ambitions. Thebid by 21st Century Foxfor the 61% of Sky it does not already own is imminent. It is currently being bounced between Fox and the European Commission as part of what are known as ""pre-notification talks"". They are a formality. Very soon, Fox will formally notify Karen Bradley of their bid and she will have 10 days to decide whether to refer the bid to telecoms regulator Ofcom. James Murdoch gave evidence to the first Leveson Inquiry I asked Brown specifically whether he thought that the Murdochs, and James Murdoch, were fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence. ""Before you make a decision about the ownership of a very important media organisation, you should know all the facts.

""Most of them resolve at least in the main around the Murdoch media and that's where the inquiry has got to start."" News UK declined to comment on these assertions.

"Large rallies by security forces have been held in Xinjiang recently China is in the midst of what it calls a ""people's war on terror"" in its far west. What sparked this latest campaign was a knife attack. After five people were killed on 14 February in Xinjiang, home to China's Muslim Uighur minority, Beijing began an ""all out offensive"". It flew in thousands of armed troops to hold mass police rallies and deploy columns of armoured vehicles on city streets. Xinjiang's Communist Party boss Chen Quanguo urged these forces to ""bury the corpses of terrorists in the vast sea of a people's war"". Mass police rallies held in Xinjiang China to track cars in terrorism crackdown Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? More about Xinjiang Judging from the reaction on Chinese social media, at least some people approve. ""Terrorists will never be stamped out unless we weaken Muslim religious forces,"" urged one post on China's Twitter-like Weibo. Then on Monday the so-called Islamic State released a video, which appeared directly to threaten China and which showed Uighur fighters training. But the ethnic Uighur population of Xinjiang has no discernible voice. In the midst of an ""all-out offensive"" it is dangerous for them to speak up, unless to echo the government's message. One contact in Kashgar told the BBC that the situation is ""hypersensitive"", with all business in the city closed down by night. He said members of his family are summoned to weekly meetings to demonstrate political allegiance. ""We are reliving the Cultural Revolution"", he said. Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims They make up about 45% of Xinjiang's population; 40% are Han Chinese China re-established control in 1949 after crushing the short-lived state of East Turkestan Since then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han Chinese Uighurs fear that their traditional culture will be eroded Who are the Uighurs? So what lies behind China's biggest show of force in Xinjiang in nearly a decade? Theincident in Pishanon 14 February is the only deadly attack to be reported this year. Details are still scarce but there is no suggestion of the kind of outside involvement or large scale co-ordination which might explain such an enormous response. Instead, unofficial reports suggest the trigger for the attack may have been something far more personal: the police punishment of a Uighur family who held a Muslim prayer meeting at home. This is surely not the kind of scenario which requires the deployment of thousands of paramilitary reinforcements. But the state controlled Xinjiang Daily newspaper has urged security forces to prepare ""for a battle between good and evil, lightness and dark"" and the region's Communist Party boss warned of ""grim conditions"" in the fight against terrorism. As well as the firm hand of Beijing, Uighurs are involved in the running of their semi-autonomous region So are conditions really grim? Notwithstanding the video threat, outside Xinjiang, there has been no significant terrorist attack in China since 2014 and reported attacks in the region have been sporadic and small-scale. By contrast, France has seen numerous terror attacks in recent years, including several major atrocities. But the French government did not declare a frontline, fly in thousands of troops or mount mass armed rallies on city streets. It's hard to escape the conclusion that China is wielding a hammer to crack a nut. But Xinjiang's security forces are already well armed with every form of ""nutcracker"", including highly trained manpower, rapid response units, mobile police stations, surveillance cameras, helicopters, drones, satellite tracking of vehicles, biometrics and grid style management of every community right down to the individual household. Police control and public surveillance is on the rise across China So what explains the force? It's possible that the current security situation in Xinjiang is worse than appears and that there are many attacks going unreported. Or that China has a very different risk calculus from other countries and feels a hammer is the appropriate response to every nut. A third possibility is that warning of ""grim conditions"" in counter-terrorism serves an unrelated purpose and the nut must be redefined as an existential threat to justify the hammer. My feeling is that all three explanations play a part. The first is the least significant. It's hard to verify occasional unofficial reports of small scale attacks in remote parts of Xinjiang because it's extremely difficult and dangerous for local Uighurs to contact foreign reporters. But it's unlikely that the authorities could cover up a major atrocity even if they wished to. The risk calculus is a much bigger factor. It's a sweeping generalisation unsupported by hard evidence, but in my experience Chinese citizens are risk averse. They have a higher expectation than, for example, British citizens, that their government must keep them safe. China's growing authoritarianism means there is no vocal constituency arguing that civil liberties are worth a certain price in national security. Besides which, low trust in official news sources makes Chinese society susceptible to rumour and panic. So China's leaders have to be risk averse when dealing with a high density population, which is only grudgingly loyal in the first place and unlikely to be resilient to terror or tolerant of failure to prevent it. In Xinjiang, recent attacks may be small, but Beijing needs to show its public that it is doing something about them, even if that something is ineffectual or worse, counter-productive. The region's security forces are already well trained and armed Turning to the third possible motive for an ""all-out offensive"" against scattered enemies armed only with knives, China has powerful vested interests whose objectives are advanced by talking up the security threat. The politicians involved want to strengthen their hand before a crucial Communist Party Congress in the autumn, the security services want to expand their bureaucratic empire, and the businesses producing surveillance equipment and software have money to make. Ethnic riots in 2009 left nearly 200 dead and led to mass arrests, against which these women protested Despite China's best efforts to cut off the routes of escape via Central and South East Asia, more than 100 Uighur fighters have made their way to Iraq and Syria. And now, IS is using footage from Xinjiang in its propaganda videos. It's impossible to judge how far this would have happened without policies of religious and cultural repression in Xinjiang. Banning beards and head scarves in public places, forcing Muslims to break their rules on fasting, demolishing mosques, micromanaging religious education, exacting outward shows of ideological loyalty serves to alienate Uighurs in Xinjiang. Some Uighurs feel their distinct culture is under threat In many countries terror triggers the impulse to repress and punish the community which appears to harbour the ""terrorist"". But other societies debate the dangers of alienation and the risk that those criminalised may become even more vulnerable to exploitation by extremists. In 2014, making the case for an honest appraisal of the dangers of repression earned the Uighur academic Ilham Tohti a life sentence in prison. The risk of demonising such mild dissent is to leave China's Uighurs only the voice of the separatist, the ""terrorist"" or the religious fundamentalist. Despite relatively moderate activism, Uighur academic Ilham Tohti was jailed for life At present, the cost of this silence is experienced only by Uighurs and by Han Chinese who live and work in Xinjiang. But this may change. Already the technologies of an Orwellian police state are advancing across China. Security services have no inhibitions about accessing social media accounts and private financial records to build an increasingly complete picture of the lives of persons of interest. A vaguely worded new anti-terror law and accompanying narrative of foreign threats justify every constriction of civil liberties and detention of human rights lawyers, labour activists, religious believers and feminists. Most of the Uighur ethnic minority, which makes up about 45% of Xinjiang's population, practise the Muslim faith Occasionally the Chinese public pushes back with complaints on social media about aggressive policing or miscarriages of justice. And China does have traditions of soft power as well as hard - strains of Confucian paternalism in which a benign emperor rules through wisdom and natural authority, not through fear. But in 2017, these strains are absent in Xinjiang. There's no significant pushback to the Communist Party message that the security of the state trumps the liberty of the citizen. So China will go on failing to win the battle for hearts and minds in Xinjiang, and failing to convince the outside world that its offensive there is a clear-cut battle between good and evil.

"Water was pumped out from a tanker to simulate wet weather conditions Ferrari set the fastest lap for the second time in four days as the first pre-season test came to an end. Kimi Raikkonen was 0.897 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Lewis Hamilton did not run after Mercedes discovered an electrical problem with the car, while team-mate Valtteri Bottas was eighth-fastest. Williams were unable to test because of damage done to their car in a crash by rookie Lance Stroll on Wednesday. A chassis needed repairing after the 18-year-old Canadian spun into the barriers in his third off-track moment in two days. Williams said they ""aimed to be back on track"" for the start of the second and final test on Tuesday. Mercedes were afflicted by reliability problems for the first time in what has been an otherwise impressive first test, with the team stopping Bottas early when it discovered an anomaly in the computer data. Englishman Jolyon Palmer continued what has been an encouraging first test for Renault with the third fastest time. ""I am driving with such a big smile on my face because the car feels so nice to drive,"" Palmer said. ""Everything at the moment is pointing in a good direction.""

Haas driver Romain Grosjean said there had been ""a lot of progress made from last year"" but said the 'intermediate' tyre ""got destroyed a bit too early, so some work is to be done"". F1's pre-season testing schedule Latest F1 2017 car launch gallery Stroll, who is making his debut in F1 this season, is bringing considerable financial backing to Williams - said to be at least Â£20m this year. That is in addition to a similar amount last year, when the team provided him with an extensive test programme in a two-year-old car at circuits around the world to prepare him for his debut. But he has had a torrid introduction to F1 in Spain this week. Lance Stroll's Williams hit the wall at Turn Six during yesterday's pre-season testing On Tuesday, his first day in the 2017 Williams car, Stroll crashed at the high-speed Turn Nine after just 12 laps and damaged the front wing. Williams had to stop running for the day while the wing was sent back to their base in Oxfordshire for repairs and a new one was flown out for Wednesday. Stroll then completed 100 laps before crashing again at Turn Six. Williams engineering chief Rob Smedley said Stroll had been caught out by the lack of grip on cold tyres. ""Lance was out on cold tyres, on an out-lap with a lot of fuel in the car, and the tyre stepped away from him,"" Smedley said. ""He was an innocent victim of that happening and what should have been an innocuous sideways moment brought him around into the barrier and did some damage. That happens and we expect it to happen, there is no blame on his part."" The second and final pre-season test runs from 7-10 March, with the first race of the season in Australia on 24-26 March.

"When a German Chancellor feels the need to explain the refugee convention to an American president, the speaker of British House of Commons says the leader of its closest ally is not welcome to address parliament, China positions itself as the grown-up in the room by chiding him for his blunt Twitter diplomacy and the botched travel ban is denounced not just by US adversaries, such as Iran, but allies, such as France and Canada, is it not time to sound the death-knell of American exceptionalism? That is, the credo pushed by successive presidents that the United States is a beacon of democracy, an exemplar of human rights, an indispensable country imbued with special values and beliefs that grants it the moral authority and national self-belief to influence and admonish other countries, friend and foe alike. Donald Trump, rather than being heralded as the leader of free world, has been pilloried. By protesters who took to the streets - and snow - from Australia to Antarctica as part of more than 600 protests worldwide on the first weekend of his presidency. By satirists who came up with the ""Netherlands Second"" viral video - and all its other cheeky iterations - in response to Trump's ""America First"" doctrine. By models at Milan Fashion Week who paraded on the catwalk wearing the now iconic pink pussy hats that first appeared on the Washington Mall at the massive women's march. By graphic designers who have created a gallery of scolding magazine covers, including, most shockingly, Der Spiegel's depiction of the US president holding aloft the severed head of the Statue of Liberty. When Jimmy Kimmel joked during his Oscars opening monologue that Donald Trump had made 225 countries hate America, he was exaggerating. As with all well-aimed satire, however, it contained more than a kernel of truth. It is a measure of Trump's unpopularity that George W Bush, the last US president to attract such international ire,is being rehabilitated in the global mind as a cool-headed statesmanand staunch defender of American press freedom. Last year, at the height of the presidential campaign, a Pew Research Center poll suggested that 85% of Europeans have ""no confidence"" in Donald Trump to do the right thing as president. A poll conducted by Gallup International Association suggested that, were the US election to be held in 45 foreign countries, Hillary Clinton would have won a landslide victory in every single one, with the sole exception of Russia. The French President Francois Hollande even said the brash billionaire made people ""want to retch"". Though international leaders are now more respectful, few could be described as being genuinely admiring. It will take more than his speech before the joint session of Congress, in which Trump sought to stabilise his presidency, to assuage global concerns. During his inaugural address, Donald Trump paid lip service to the notion of American exceptionalism, though he did not use the phrase. ""We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example,"" he declared. ""We will shine for everyone to follow."" But rather than painting a picture of sunny American uplands, his inaugural address sketched out something darker and more dystopian: a country marred by poverty-stricken and crime-ridden inner cities and ""rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape"". The speech will be remembered not for his brief invocation of American exceptionalism, but rather his depiction of ""American carnage"" and his pledge to put ""America First."" It was bunker America rather than beacon America. In his speech to the joint session of Congress, there was another perfunctory acknowledgment of exceptionalism thinking when he said the ""torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world."" But although softer in tone than his angry inaugural, Tuesday night's address was stridently nationalistic nonetheless. ""My job is not to represent the world,"" he affirmed. ""My job is to represent the United States of America."" Donald Trump has already signalled he believes that America can be great without it being exceptional. In a jaw-dropping interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News broadcast on Super Bowl Sunday, Trump seemed to reject the central tenet of exceptionalist thinking: that American values are the global gold standard. Asked why he favoured closer ties with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom O'Reilly characterised as ""a killer"", Trump responded: ""There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?"" For critics, it implied a moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, a country that in recent years has annexed Crimea, been accused of murdering internal opponents, allegedly committed war crimes in Syria and severely curtailed LGBT rights. Donald Trump also appears to set more store in hard power, the use and threat of force, than soft power, the use of more subtle forms of suasion such as diplomacy and international aid. This video can not be played Donald Trump addressed Congress for the first time. Just look at this week's budget proposal, which calls for an almost 10% splurge on defence spending to be paid for in part by cuts to State Department funding and international aid. Promoting human rights abroad, a central tenet of the exceptionalist creed, no longer appears to be an urgent priority. The United States is even said to be considering withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council, partly because of what it perceives as UN bias against Israel. Acting on another exceptionalist impulse, America has traditionally championed press freedom around the world. The First Amendment resonates way beyond these shores. But with Donald Trump continuing to rage against the US media in an attempt, seemingly, to delegitimise it, America's clarion voice on press freedom has at best been compromised and at worst been rendered mute. Rather than wanting America to be emulated, it would appear that Trump prefers it to be feared. And although local criticism, from media organisations like the New York Times, lays bare his thin skin, international criticism seems almost to have an emboldening effect. If other countries are railing against him, it is a sign he is doing his job and delivering on his campaign promises. It brings to mind the famed chant heard from the stands of Millwall FC, one of the least fashionable clubs in the English football league: ""No-one likes us, we don't care."" Right now, it's American adulation that he seems to crave more than global admiration. To many international ears, American exceptionalism has long sounded like bogus boosterism, a vain conceit. What right did a country that countenanced slavery and the racial apartheid of Jim Crow have to lecture others? Even in World War Two, when America became the ""arsenal of the democracy"" in the defeat of fascism, it was a segregated US military that took to the battlefield. Vietnam, Watergate, Guantanamo Bay, the Iraq war and electronic eavesdropping. To foreign critics, American exceptionalism doubles as American hypocrisy. Barack Obama sought to revive the concept after the Bush years, when America's global stock was low, and regularly spoke of exceptionalism. Under his presidency, however, it continued to have negative connotations. America was exceptional because of its high rates of gun crime, its multiple killings and its racial flare-ups. Rebels in Syria wondered why the Obama administration wasn't doing more to help it oust a murderous despot like Bashar al-Assad. Moreover, Guantamano Bay, a US landmark that loomed larger in the post-911 era than the Statue of Liberty in many Muslim countries, remained open. This video can not be played Ian Pannell reports from the city of Baltimore: ""Hope has given way to despair"" US democracy was also widely seen as falling into disrepute, because of the dysfunction in Washington, the rise of hyper-partisan oppositional politics and the anger that poisoned the entire polity. The 2016 presidential campaign, pitting two such deeply unpopular candidates against each other in a hugely uninspiring contest, presented an ugly shop window. The Electoral College, for those unversed in its intricacies and anomalies, also seemed demonstrably undemocratic. How could Donald Trump emerge the victor, they asked, when Hillary Clinton received almost three million more votes? American exceptionalism was looking shaky even before Donald Trump took the oath of office. A key difference is that Barack Obama continued until his final days to talk of building a more perfect union, an aspiration that sprung from his exceptionalist ethos, while Donald Trump continues to talk of building that wall along the Mexican border. Over the centuries, what has set US global leadership apart from the European powers that used to dominate the world is a fundamental difference in national mindset: America came to believe it was born to lead rather than born to rule. Having won its independence from an imperial power, it sought to colonise the planet with its values and ideas rather than building a territorial empire. Ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought America into the war, the assertion of global leadership, and the promulgation of its ideas that goes with it, has been deemed central to the national self-interest. But Trumpism, with its narrower homeland focus, looks like making a definitive break from this past. His planned wall could end up serving as the metaphor for his presidency. Trump's America might end up being a forcefully protected citadel, but will it be a city on a hill?

"Emmanuel Macron says left and right in politics are irrelevant Presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron has emerged as a major force in French politics despite never being elected to office. The independent centrist's campaign has been boosted by the setbacks of centre-right rival Francois Fillon, who faces formal investigation over fake job allegations involving his wife. Mr Macron seems likely to face the far-right National Front's Marine le Pen in a second round of voting, and he is seen as a key defender of liberal European values from populist forces on the continent. Amid accusations that he was all image and short on substance, he launched his election campaign on 2 March. Mr Macron has maintained that the left and right in politics are irrelevant and out of fashion. He was economy minister in President Francois Hollande's centre-left Socialist administration until last year, but has played down his links to Mr Hollande. His current movement was a new project and definitely not a continuation of Mr Hollande's, he said at the campaign launch. Instead he has urged France to rediscover its ""spirit of conquest"", and called for a ""transformation"" rather than just reform, in which every French citizen would play a part. As Mr Fillon faces questions over his wife's employment, his rival has proposed eradicating ""nepotism"" and ""conflicts of interest"". ""All elected representatives must respect the law and public morality,"" he said at the launch. Mr Fillon has vowed to continue his campaign despite questions about his wife's employment The measures he is proposing include banning MPs from doing any consulting work and banning all officials from employing family or friends. He is also seeking to cut the size of both chambers of parliament - the National Assembly and the Senate - by a third. Mr Macron has not said whether he would lift France's state of emergency, launched following the Paris attacks in November 2015, but he has promised to ""evaluate"" it. He said no new measures would be taken on terrorism, and ruled out what he described as symbolic policies such as removing French nationality from dual citizens, which would only divide the country. He would not accept stigmatising people for their religion, or religious-based bigotry, he added. Mr Macron (R) has sought to distance himself from former mentor Francois Hollande The key was to make existing security measures work more effectively, he said. He has, however, promised 10,000 more police officers - similar to a pledge made by Marine Le Pen - and the rebuilding of regional intelligence networks. Mr Macron has also emphasised a revival in community policing, and in particular rebuilding relations between police and young people. While Ms Le Pen seeks to take France out of the eurozone and hold a referendum on France's relationship with the European Union, Mr Macron is an ardent supporter of the EU. He has called for efforts to reinvigorate the eurozone and a new impulse for the single market, which he said should be vigorously defended in Brexit talks with the UK. Mr Macron caused some consternation among conservative circles a few weeks ago by describing France's colonialism as a ""crime against humanity"". He has since apologised for ""hurting some people's feelings"" but has not withdrawn the statement. On defence, he has proposed increasing spending to 2% of GDP - a key demand of the US and other Nato allies. He is also calling for an ""international roadmap"" to combat militant Islamism, and described Africa as a region that had ""all the risks and all the opportunities"" for France. Mr Macron has urged French workers to embrace a transformation of the workplace. ""Work is going to change and we will be part of that change. We will go with it and we will transform the balance of forces,"" he said. He has proposed aligning the public sector pension scheme with the private sector. Such measures have been tried in the past and have provoked huge opposition from the left, but he describes the move as an end to inequality between schemes. He has also pledged no change to the retirement age for five years, and to retain the 35-hour working week, both moves seen as directed at left-wing voters. In a budget programme unveiled days before his campaign launch, Mr Macron proposed savings of â¬60bn ($63bn; Â£51bn) over five years, including cuts to the civil service. He also pledged to keep the deficit to below 3% of economic output. Mr Macron has made education one of his main priorities. He has pledged to put the three ""Rs"" at the heart of education policy and reduce class sizes.

"Water was pumped out from a tanker to simulate wet weather conditions Ferrari set the fastest lap for the second time in four days as the first pre-season test came to an end. Kimi Raikkonen was 0.897 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Lewis Hamilton did not run after Mercedes discovered an electrical problem with the car, while team-mate Valtteri Bottas was eighth-fastest. Williams were unable to test because of damage done to their car in a crash by rookie Lance Stroll on Wednesday. A chassis needed repairing after the 18-year-old Canadian spun into the barriers in his third off-track moment in two days. Williams said they ""aimed to be back on track"" for the start of the second and final test on Tuesday. Mercedes were afflicted by reliability problems for the first time in what has been an otherwise impressive first test, with the team stopping Bottas early when it discovered an anomaly in the computer data. Englishman Jolyon Palmer continued what has been an encouraging first test for Renault with the third fastest time. ""I am driving with such a big smile on my face because the car feels so nice to drive,"" Palmer said. ""Everything at the moment is pointing in a good direction.""

Drivers had asked for changes to the 'extreme' tyre, used in the heaviest rain, because it was too prone to aquaplaning. Haas driver Romain Grosjean said there had been ""a lot of progress made from last year"" but said the 'intermediate' tyre ""got destroyed a bit too early, so some work is to be done"". F1's pre-season testing schedule Latest F1 2017 car launch gallery Stroll, who is making his debut in F1 this season, is bringing considerable financial backing to Williams - said to be at least Â£20m this year. That is in addition to a similar amount last year, when the team provided him with an extensive test programme in a two-year-old car at circuits around the world to prepare him for his debut. But he has had a torrid introduction to F1 in Spain this week. Lance Stroll's Williams hit the wall at Turn Six during yesterday's pre-season testing On Tuesday, his first day in the 2017 Williams car, Stroll crashed at the high-speed Turn Nine after just 12 laps and damaged the front wing. Williams had to stop running for the day while the wing was sent back to their base in Oxfordshire for repairs and a new one was flown out for Wednesday. Stroll then completed 100 laps before crashing again at Turn Six. Williams engineering chief Rob Smedley said Stroll had been caught out by the lack of grip on cold tyres. ""Lance was out on cold tyres, on an out-lap with a lot of fuel in the car, and the tyre stepped away from him,"" Smedley said. ""He was an innocent victim of that happening and what should have been an innocuous sideways moment brought him around into the barrier and did some damage. That happens and we expect it to happen, there is no blame on his part."" The second and final pre-season test runs from 7-10 March, with the first race of the season in Australia on 24-26 March.

"Mallie Hsieh (L) and Amy Lin say it's time to stop vilifying people for their weight Taking the metro with Mallie Hsieh, 32, and Amy Lin, 34, it's obvious they're wider than most of the other passengers. Mallie is perched on the edge of a seat trying not to squeeze up against the man next to her. Amy takes up nearly two seats. In Taiwan, a society that thinks one has to be thin to be beautiful, Mallie and Amy -  who both weigh more than 85kg (13 stone) - stand out. But the women are not ashamed of their body size and they don't like anyone trying to make them feel so. ""Many foreigners think Taiwanese people are very friendly, but to me many people here are too friendly,"" says Amy. ""People I don't know would come up and tell me: 'You're too fat. Do you want me to help you lose weight?' But my body is my responsibility! Why do other people feel they can correct me on my body?"" Taiwanese body weight has been rising in the past few decades, a result of people eating more - especially fatty and sugary processed foods - and not getting enough exercise. Now nearly 45% of adults are classed as overweight or obese; so are 29% of children. A government campaign to promote slimming down, entering its seventh year, has barely reduced that percentage. But Mallie and Amy think it's time Taiwan stopped vilifying people for being fat. Both women have been overweight since they were children. Mallie, a social worker who helps people with HIV/Aids, comes from a family in which everyone is large except her mother. ""What annoys me is people thinking there's something wrong with me, including my mom. She tells me: 'You're still so fat. Why don't we work harder at losing weight this year?' But she's not so concerned about my brother even though he weighs more than I do,"" said Mallie. ""I've been trying to lose weight for the past 20 years. It's very tiring."" The duo's Facebook videos poke fun at society's views of overweight people Amy, who works at an NGO that advocates for the LGBT community, is the only overweight person in her family. ""I think I got fat because I think eating and being full are a very important part of being happy,"" she says. ""Many years later, I realised food had that effect on me. I don't want to change this."" Sweet sensation:One mother's battle against sugar Meeting in secret:The outcast wives of India 'The priest refused to marry us':The couple who fought World War Two racism In late 2015, the women launched theirFacebook page Lady Bom Bom Power,external, also called Rou Dan Tian Xin, or Meatball Sweethearts, in Chinese. Every month, they post a video or an essay which, through humour, combats stereotypes and aims to change perceptions. In a video posted just before the recent Lunar New Year holiday,a skit shows an overweight woman at her family gathering,externalbeing told by her brother she's already too fat, so she shouldn't eat so much, otherwise she wouldn't be able to get married. Her mother tells her she's eating her brother's share. Mallie and Amy then offer advice to viewers on how to deal with such unpleasant comments from family and relatives. ""I usually try to change the topic quickly, look that person straight in the eye, smile and say: 'Thank you for your concern auntie' and keep eating,"" Mallie tells viewers. Amy adds: ""I would be a bit more polite and say: 'Being able to eat is happiness,' and walk away with my rice bowl."" The women also share tips on how to handle questions about how they will find a boyfriend or husband. Mallie says: ""I tell them 'Actually even if I become thin, I might not necessarily marry a man!' I believe they won't keep asking after that!"" In another video, theytackle questions people often ask,externalthose who are overweight: ""Where do fat people make friends?"" Amy answers: ""Actually I don't have any friends."" Another person asked: ""Is fat people's poop bigger?"" Humour aside, the women's message is clear: fat people don't like to be treated differently by the rest of society. Mallie and Amy believe there is particular pressure in Taiwan and other parts of Asia to conform to a thin beauty standard. ""I think practically all of Asia thinks being beautiful means being thin,"" Mallie said. ""For example, overseas you can buy clothes that are size 14 or 16. Here in Taiwan, they don't import large sizes. We have to buy them online."" Consumer culture in Taiwan is geared more towards a thin aesthetic The response to their website has been mostly positive. They have nearly 8,000 followers and some videos have enjoyed more than 30,000 views. Local media have also interviewed them. ""Many people say we've spoken what was on their mind,"" said Mallie. One overweight viewer wrote: ""You two are amazing! Usually I lose it when people ask me such questions."" But some viewers express concerns about health: ""Of course you can be fat and confident, fat in a beautiful way, but to throw away health, that's a problem!"" But Mallie and Amy say they're not promoting being fat - they accept there are health risks. They simply want people to accept their own and other people's bodies. Surprisingly, their webpage has also struck a chord with people considered too thin, too tall or too tomboyish and even so-called normal size people. ""What made the strongest impression on me is a woman who recognised me on the street one day, came up and thanked us for what we were doing,"" said Amy. ""I thought she didn't have such problems because she has a standard body size, but she said actually from the time she was young, she has faced pressure to look a certain way, which made her unhappy. ""So it makes me think who has this society spared? Who in this society is really relaxed about the way they look?"" What they want to do is ""teach people to be accepting of different body types so that we can be mentally and physically well"", Mallie says. ""I hope after seeing our videos, people really feel free towards themselves and others,"" Amy said. ""Real happiness to me is accepting who I am and having other people accept who I am.""

"What are the biggest public health challenges in 2017? Chelsea Clinton writes about the issues she believes will matter in the year ahead – and argues for urgent work to tackle America’s disproportionate problem with opioid addiction. Grand Challenges A guide to the issues that define our age We may have things better than ever – but we’ve also never faced such world-changing challenges. That’s whyFuture Now asked 50 experts– scientists, technologists, business leaders and entrepreneurs – to name what they saw as the key challenges in their area. The range of different responses demonstrate the richness and complexity of the modern world. Inspired by these responses, over the next month we will be publishing a series of feature articles and videos that take an in-depth look atthe biggest challenges we face today. Many of the global health challenges I see in 2017 were painfully present and widely acknowledged as challenges in 2016. This is true of specific demographic questions, such as how to help protect public health for refugees and provide refugees health care. It’s also true of methodological questions, such as how to ensure that health is a meaningful part of conversations in other areas, such as climate change, economic development and women’s rights, including the right to a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery. It’s true when we think about the resources available to global health overall, and the resources allocated to address ‘new’ health threats like Zika, and more ‘familiar’ health threats, including polio or malaria. And, finally, it’s true when we think about questions of governance, of determining what’s on the global health agenda, how that agenda will be addressed and financed, who will do the work, how will that work be judged and how will those judgments hold those doing the work and in charge accountable. Questions of resource allocation and governance are even more salient in 2017 given a new Director-General will assume leadership at the World Health Organisation (WHO) later this year and donor governments around the world are questioning the value of development assistance, including in health. There is a challenge that – while acknowledged in 2016 – only began to claw its way up the global and domestic agenda last year and deserves a more prominent place in 2017: opioid addiction and overdose. The US Centers for Disease Control recognises that our country is gripped by an ‘opioid overdose epidemic,’ and various studies estimate that80%of those struggling with opioid use don’t get the help they need. The global gap between need and access to treatment is even greater; the WHO estimates90%of those who need treatment don’t get it. Over the past few years, the Clinton Foundation has worked with researchers at Johns Hopkins University to study the opioid epidemic that has ravaged families and communities across the US. We learned that by decreasing stigma around addiction and increasing access while normalising attitudes to life-saving Naloxone – an antidote for opioid overdose – we can save thousands of lives. We’re working with partners to make Naloxone widely affordable (and at times free) and accessible to EMTs, police officers, educators, and community first responders, so that they know how to use Naloxone and are ready to use it whenever needed to save someone’s life – at a school, in a park, on a street, in a home. No longer is this first a criminal justice issue. Rather, it is a public health and awareness issue and is widely beginning to be acknowledged as such. It is also a moral issue – we know now that Naloxone has the chance to save thousands of lives. The next question is what role can Naloxone play in saving lives around the world? We hope the Clinton Foundation’s early work in changing markets and distribution systems around HIV/AIDS medicines may provide a model and we know we need new partners in the mental health, health systems and education spaces, among others, to help shape any future global opioid addiction work. And, of course, we need research to inform potential global work as it has in the US. There is always more data to be collected, more assumptions to be challenged, more stories to be inspired by. No one should die of an opioid overdose in 2017 in America, or anywhere – as in all areas where we know how to prevent such deaths, we have an obligation to save lives and work toward zero. Chelsea Clinton is Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation --------------------------------------- AMERICA’S OPIOID ADDICTION Analysis by Bryan Lufkin, BBC Future In the United States, opioid addiction has become an epidemic, according to national health organisations. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 91 Americans die a day from opioid dependence, totalling 33,000 deaths in 2015 – more than any year on record. In fact, suchdrugs now kill more Americans than guns or car accidents. Opioids are synthetic drugs that mimic the effects of the opium from poppy plants. Since ancient times, opium has yielded pleasure and deadened pain in humans, interacting with the nervous system and nerve cells in the brain. But that’s also what makes it addictive. Today, opioids take the form of prescription painkillers and illicit substances like heroin. Sales of prescription opioidsquadrupledin the US from 1999 to 2010. According to the World Health Organisation, 15 million people worldwide suffer from addiction to opium-derived drugs, and each year they kill 69,000 people. But why is a huge chunk of that number in the US? Prescriptions of opioid medications have soared in the country since the late 1990s. Some point to doctors over-prescribing powerful opioid painkillers to their patients, and those medications — like OxyContin and Vicodin — often “serve as gateway drugs to heroin, which has a nearly identical chemical makeup and is cheaper and sometimes easier to obtain,”according to the US National Security Council.(Heroin-related deaths have tripled in the US since 2010.) Last year, the BBCinvestigated the phenomenonin the rural American heartland, where the epidemic has hit the country hard. So, what’s being done about it? Last year, a group called the Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose launched in Washington, DC, and other health organisations are pivoting to make finding a solution a priority. They’re pursuing a push to increase the availability of Naloxone, a prescription drug that reverses the effects of an opiate overdose. And last year, the US Food & Drug Administration began requiring opioid painkillers’ boxes to feature labels that warn of abuse and overdose risks. Educating doctors and changing prescribing guidelines will also play a role. The sooner strategies are worked out, the better. Opioid addiction is on the rise worldwide, but it’s significantly more pressing in the US.According to the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, the US makes up less than 5% of the global population – but consumes 80% of the world’s opioids.

"No matter how much you warn visitors to Cuba that they'll be offline during their stay, they often won't believe it until they actually arrive in Havana. On arrival, they find their iPads and smartphones suddenly only serve for taking photos which, to their dismay, can't be immediately posted to their Instagram or Facebook accounts. Whether Snapchat-obsessed millennials or email-addicted workaholics, they stare at their phones in disbelief, waiting in vain for the familiar  ""4G"" symbol to appear, as the realisation dawns that an enforced digital detox is upon them. Conversely, plenty of travellers to Cuba relish the chance to disconnect from the office emails and the constant barrage of WhatsApp alerts and tweets. Yet what for the tourist is either a temporary inconvenience or a welcome offline breather is a very different reality for ordinary Cubans. For years, it felt to many on the island like the internet was something happening elsewhere, to other people. People use public wi-fi to connect their devices in a street in Havana Recently though, it is easier, and cheaper, to get online in Cuba than it used to be. There are now more than 240 public access wi-fi spots dotted around the country and the price for an hour of internet access, while still expensive by international standards, has dropped by more than half, to $1.50 (Â£1.20) for an hour. It is now a common sight to see people sitting with their laptops or phones in parks and public plazas connecting with their families abroad via video-chat technology. Cuba: Airbnb cashes in on surge in tourism Cuba's DIY economy raises hope How times are changing in Havana In the latest development, the state telecommunications company, Etecsa, has installed internet connections in around 2,000 homes in the capital's colonial district, Old Havana, as part of a two-month pilot scheme. Among the lucky few is Jose Antonio Ruiz. His modest apartment in one of the neighbourhood's newer buildings is part of the government's domestic online experiment. As a private business owner who rents rooms to tourists, Mr Ruiz has found the new ""luxury"" helped him in two main ways. First, he says, he can advertise his apartment more easily on popular accommodation websites like Airbnb, and answer his clients' emails much more promptly than before. Guesthouse owner Jose Antonio Ruiz says internet access has benefited his business Secondly, he can offer his guests a unique service giving him a competitive advantage over other guesthouses. ""The guests are really pleased when you tell them we have internet,"" Jose Antonio explains. ""They relax as they know they can check their flights from here, read their emails or contact their families."" During the pilot, the connection is free but once it's over the government is expected to publish prices, so users can choose whether to keep the service or live without it. It hasn't yet been confirmed but it is believed it will cost around $15 (Â£12) for 30 hours at the slowest speed of 128 kilobits per second, and up to $110 (Â£90) for the fastest - two megabits per second. With the average wage in Cuba about $25 (Â£20) a month, those prices would be prohibitively expensive for many Cubans. Jose Antonio's connection is not fast enough to stream video, for example. Still, it is an improvement on the dial-up connections that some state employees have at home and he says he'd pay to keep it as it's enough for what he needs. One day, though, those needs could change, says Cuban youth blogger Ariel Montenegro. ""The digital transformation of a country is not just giving people the internet, but giving them services on the internet, Cuban services,"" he explains at a public access wi-fi point in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana. Increased connectivity provides a boost to businesses like property rental companies ""Like banking or paying your bills or buying tickets for the movie theatre or applying to college. When those kinds of national services start to happen online then people will naturally become more impatient."" Such a move will take time, he thinks. However, much has already happened in a relatively short period. ""If you compare it with the rest of the world, of course we're still behind,"" admits Mr Montenegro. ""But it's progress. When I started college, although we had the internet, it was really, really, really slow. You could barely do anything."" ""In five years' time, I believe that at least every university will have a really fast internet connection as well as in libraries, in schools and more public wi-fi spots."" The Cuban government's position on the internet is twofold. First it blames the US economic embargo for the lack of information technology in Cuba, saying that many of the major IT firms around the world fear running foul of Washington's strict rules on trading with Cuba. Vice-President Miguel Angel Diaz Canel is believed to be open to greater online access Since the bilateral thaw of December 2014, that has been harder to argue, of course. Last year Google reached an agreement with Etecsa on storing its online content, such as YouTube video and Gmail, on servers inside Cuba to improve local access. Google executives are also keen to provide further internet-based solutions to challenges on the island. However, there is also a lingering official distrust of unfettered internet access. Whether stemming from an ill-advised USAid-run programme intended to undermine the Castro government via a text message-based form of ""Cuban Twitter"" called ZunZuneo or a broader suspicion of social media as a tool of dissent, the authorities have traditionally been wary of the net. Following his meeting with Raul Castro last year, the then British Foreign Secretary, Phillip Hammond, told the BBC that the 85-year-old Cuban president ""clearly understands the power of the digital economy to drive growth"" but had also raised his concerns over ""the negative aspects of the internet from online radicalisation to child sexual exploitation"". Mr Castro has a little under a year to go before he steps down from the presidency. His expected successor, Vice-President Miguel Angel Diaz Canel, is thought to be receptive to greater online access after he once publicly defended a group of young bloggers who had posted relatively critical material online. As the home internet pilot scheme draws to an close, the Cuban government must next decide whether to shut it down or roll it out across the island. Depending on the price, many thousands of potential users are ready to connect.

"Ed Sheeran: ""I think this year is going to be the high point of my career"" In the first part of our exclusive interview with Ed Sheeran, the singer talked about writing 10 different versions of his third album, Ã· (Divide), and revealed he had a song ""better than Thinking Out Loud"". Ed Sheeran: 'I've topped Thinking Out Loud' In this, the second part, we delve deeper, using Ã· (Divide)'s song titles as the jumping off point for a series of random, but revealing questions. So, if you want to know how he burned his foot on a volcano, what he bought his girlfriend for Christmas, or when Taylor Swift's new album is coming out, read on. You erased yourself from social media last year. Was that for peace of mind? My mind was definitely more settled. I didn't have as much anxiety, because I didn't have as many people wanting things from me. Or I wasn't aware of the people who wanted things from me. Also, I started having conversations with people, rather than just going into my phone. Is it true you got rid of your phone completely? I don't have one at all. It's amazing. I was at a house party the other day and 50% of the people were either Snapchatting or watching Snapchat. Someone said: ""Why don't you have a phone any more?"" and I was like: ""Look around you. This is exactly why I don't have a phone."" Planet Earth II: Essential viewing at Ed Sheeran's House Now that you can afford to live in a castle, how do you make your songs relatable to fans? It doesn't matter how relevant they are. My song Don't isn't very relevant to my fans. They aren't going to ""four cities on two planes on the same day"". But the truth of the song is the frustration and anger [of being cheated on]. Everyone can relate to that. So the key is truth. Just be honest. On your last album, you sang about watching Blue Planet. Did you catch Planet Earth II? I was a massive fan of Planet Earth II. I was actually saying we should put David Attenborough in bubble wrap for 2017, because we can't lose another legend. Whose death affected you most last year? The George Michael thing really took me by surprise, because he was so young. He's younger than my dad. I had a party for New Year, and people played George Michael tunes the whole night. It was amazing to see how many people were made happy by his music. He really did affect a lot of people in a positive way, and it's just so, so sad for someone like that to go so young. This video can not be played His albums are called +, x and Ã· but how good is Ed Sheeran at maths? You burst your eardrum diving off a yacht two years ago. Were you worried it would affect your career? Well, I was born without an eardrum in that ear. I got it replaced when I was 11, then I burst it when I was 18 and again I was 24. It's actually quite a common thing, so I wasn't worried. I only have about 25% hearing in that ear anyway. What are the best and worst diet tips you've been given? I was hanging out with a model ages ago, and she used to dip cotton wool balls in diet Pepsi and that would be her meal for the day. That's a bad diet tip. The best tip is to eat what you want and exercise every day. It doesn't have to be a lot of exercise. Just keep your metabolism up. What's your poison? Beer is my biggest poison because beer puts on the most weight, and I can really guzzle beer. But now I tend to have one beer then move to spirits, rather than drinking beer all night. Is that better for hangovers? Well, my hangovers are quite bad. I find if you smoke cigarettes, your hangovers are horrendous. A friend of mine swears you can avoid a hangover by drinking two cups of tea before you go to bed. Yeah. I've been told to down a pint of water before you go to bed, and then you'll feel fine. Apparently, flat Sprite in the morning is a good cure too. The star is anxious to tour his new album, and says he's rehearsed all the songs already What is the perfect song? Something that makes you feel - whether it be happy or sad or whatever. I heard George Benson's Give Me The Night the other day, and it just made me smile and want to dance. The best songs of last year are the ones that came on the radio and you're like: ""Yes, yeah."" You never want to hear a song that makes you go: ""Nyeh, that's all right."" Galway's called the ""city of tribes"". What's your tribe? Suffolk folk - we're quite easy going, we all own bicycles  and we like our ale. Is that song a cover of the Steve Earle classic? No, it's an original. I actually tried to find another lyric. I did Wexford Girl and Clonakity Girl and Cork Girl... none of them worked. But the whole point of folk songs is taking inspiration from the past and making something new - so people will just have to deal with it. Ed Sheeran's cats: ""I'll give them medicine, then they'll cough it up in my hand. That's quite cute, actually."" What's currently making you happy? Or sad, for that matter. I'll tell you what's making me happy-sad: my cats. They've got flu, but they're just really cute. When they sneeze, that's a happy-sadness. It's like ""Aah,"" but also ""Ugh."" What's the worst injury you've ever had? I put my foot in a boiling pool of water when I was up a volcano. That was pretty bad... but when you asked that, my hand started twitching - so maybe it's that. What happened? I smashed a bottle of beer into my hand and got 12 stitches before a gig. Then I played the gig and split them open again while playing. It almost hit a tendon and meant I wouldn't be able to use this hand to play guitar. So, yeah, that was the worst injury I've had. I'm actually getting a bit twitchy thinking about it. Ed Sheeran will pose for a selfie - but he's thrown away his own smartphone Have you ever advised a girl to dump her boyfriend because you had a crush on her? Probably, when I was 14. Not since then. Not when it's been a serious relationship. Because I don't really have much else to offer. I can't be like: ""You should leave your boyfriend,"" and then disappear off on tour for four years. Given your lyrics, do people think you're wise romantically? Do they ask for advice? I'm great at advice, yeah. I give the best advice. I just won't always follow it. Do you read your own press? Yeah, all of it. At the beginning I got a bit upset, but you can't sell 22 million albums, then read a review by one person and be like: ""No-one likes me."" But I used to have a hit list. I remembered the people who didn't help, and then if they asked: ""Do you want to go on the cover of our magazine?"" I'd be like: ""Hell, no."" The list doesn't really exist any more. It was just in the very early stage of my career. Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran got together for a jam session last June, according to this photo on her Instagram account What's been the high point of the past five years? I think this year is going to be the high point. I have a feeling about it.  Seventeen is my lucky number, and everyone I was scared of releasing of albums around me released them all last year - people like Beyonce and The Weekend and Bruno Mars. Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year - Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records. So I've got a full year of just all Ed, all the time. What's the least romantic present you've ever bought? I bought my girlfriend a penknife for Christmas. Not romantic, but she wanted one. I got her a penknife, and she got me a Tech Deck - you know, those finger-sized skateboards you used to play with in school? So you listened to what she wanted and bought her it? That's the definition of romantic. OK. Do you know what? I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, and they had that new Dyson hairdryer advert - and all the girls around me, all these mums and daughters, were going, ""Oh, that looks great."" So I was like: ""[clicks fingers] Sorted for Christmas."" So that's probably the least romantic sentiment. Ed Sheeran's new album, Ã· (Divide), is released on Friday, 3 March, by Atlantic Records.

"Seventeen British citizens or residents were detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. But who are they, how did they come to be there and what became of them following their release? Jamal al-Harith Born Ronald Fiddler to a Christian Caribbean family in Manchester, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Jamal al-Harith before eventually dying as a so-called Islamic State suicide bomber in Iraq, under the alias Abu Zakariya al-Britani. He was seized by US forces in Afghanistan, transferred to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002 and released just over two years later. Al-Harith was paid compensation by the government in order to prevent an expensive class action by former detainees. The BBC has seen registration papers signed by al-Harith in April 2014, when he crossed into Syria and joined IS. His wife told Channel 4 News he may have used some of the compensation payout to fund his trip. Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed became known as ""the Tipton three"" - friends from the West Midlands who were among the first detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay, in early 2002, after being handed over to American forces in Afghanistan. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus suit in 2004 that led to a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court allowing detainees the right to legally challenge their detention. The three were released and returned to the UK in March 2004, where they were interviewed by police but never charged. The men regularly spoke out about their alleged mistreatment. Theirs were among the first accounts of alleged mistreatment by their American captors and included claims of collusion by the British state. Rhuhel Ahmed claimed that during MI5 interrogation sessions in Afghanistan, there had been ""a guy standing on the backs of my legs and another holding a gun to my head"". Mr Ahmed, who trained as a plumber when he got back to England, told the BBC: ""I don't really care if people think I'm a terrorist or not. ""The UK government doesn't. ""They've let me go, and that's good enough for me. ""I want to move on in my life."" As with all of those from Britain held in Guantanamo, the men were paid compensation by the British government. Ethiopian national Binyam Mohamed spent six years in US detention after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. He was accused of being a would-be bomber - but, in a series of seminal court hearings, his lawyers alleged he had been tortured in Pakistan, Morocco and Afghanistan. The Court of Appeal ordered the release of documents that confirmed Washington had told London of the ill treatment. Mr Mohamed was released from Guantanamo in 2009 and returned to his family. He works as a property developer. The former bookseller from Birmingham spent almost three years in US detention, in Afghanistan and then Guantanamo, accused of being an al-Qaeda operative. Since returning to the UK in January 2005, he has become the most outspokenopponent of British and US counter-terrorism policiesof those Britons held at Guantanamo. He has always denied the allegations. An attempt to prosecute him in the UK for terrorism dramatically collapsed in October 2014 after police and prosecutors were handed secret intelligence material. Outside prison Mr Begg said: ""Little has changed since the beginning of the early days in the war on terror."" Omar Deghayes came to the UK as a refugee from Col Muammar Gaddafi's Libya. He was held at Guantanamo for five years, accused of training in terror camps, and was mistakenly said to have been photographed on jihad in Chechnya. He has always denied he was a fighter, claiming to have travelled to Afghanistan to see first-hand what the Taliban were doing. He says he lost sight in an eye following mistreatment by a guard in Guantanamo and described the camp as ""a very black page in American history"". Since his return to his home on the south coast of England, Mr Deghayes has campaigned for the release of the remaining detainees in Guantanamo. Three of his nephews left their home in Brighton to fight jihad in Syria. Two of them have been killed. Bisher al-Rawi is an Iraqi refugee who settled in London and was held at Guantanamo for four years. He came to the attention of MI5 because of his friendship with the radical Palestinian-Jordanian cleric Abu Qatada. Having been tipped off by MI5, American intelligence detained Mr al-Rawi and his travelling companion, Jamil al-Banna, on a business trip to Gambia. The pair were put on a rendition flight to Afghanistan before arriving in Guantanamo in 2003. In a rare TV interview, Mr al-Rawi told the BBC he had fought an internal battle to control his anger over how he had been treated. ""I thought if you go down that road, you will destroy yourself,"" he said. Like many of his fellow detainees, Tarek Dergoul has suffered from bouts of depression since his release from Guantanamo, in 2004. Five years later, he told me it had taken until then ""to get back into the groove"". Mr Dergoul lost an arm after being hurt in a US missile strike on Afghanistan after 9/11. Over the years, he has refused media requests to discuss what he was doing there He was accused of having links to al-Qaeda, but he was never charged or put before a military tribunal. He once told me that Guantanamo had tested him. ""I like to think I did OKâ¦ but it's not over until it's over,"" he added. In 2011 Mr Dergoul was convicted of assaulting a traffic warden whom he thought had been spying on him. Mr Dergoul has not replied to the BBC's attempts to contact him. A Jordanian refugee from London, Jamil al-Banna was on the same trip to Gambia as his friend Bisher al-Rawi. Having been tipped off by MI5, American intelligence detained the pair, putting them on a rendition flight to Afghanistan before transferring them to Guantanamo in 2003. Mr al-Banna was released four years later, when he returned to England and a daughter born soon after his detention. Following a Spanish extradition request, he was arrested, but the charge was dropped in 2008. He has stayed out of public life since then. Born in Uganda, Feroz Abbasi moved to Britain with his family when he was eight and settled in Croydon, south London. Following his conversion to Islam, the troubled teenager fell into the orbit of the radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who, it was claimed, dispatched his young charge to the terror training camps of Afghanistan. Mr Abassi was detained by US forces, who accused him of being a member of al-Qaeda who had volunteered to carry out a ""martyrdom mission"". One of the first detainees sent to Guantanamo, he was released without charge in January 2005. He has refused to grant press interviews since then but has done some work for the controversial campaigning group, Cage. Martin Mubanga is a joint Zambian and British national seized by US intelligence in Zambia in 2002. Accused of having received terror training in Afghanistan,he was sent to Guantanamo. There, the Joint Task Force claimed, he had admitted being a member of al-Qaeda and been assessed as ""high risk"". But he was later cleared for release and returned to London in January 2005. He joined other former detainees in successfully seeking compensation from the British authorities. His lawyers argued that papers disclosed during the civil claim showed the British government could have prevented his transfer to Guantanamo. In a newspaper interview soon after his release, he said: ""The authorities wanted to break me, but they strengthened me. ""They've made me what I am - even if I'm not quite sure who that person is."" He writes poetry and rap. Richard Belmar is a west London convert to Islam sent to Guantanamo in October 2002 after allegedly being captured in an al-Qaeda safe house in Pakistan. He was released in January 2005, when he told a newspaper he had been beaten and sexually humiliated in US detention. It's not known where he currently lives. Abdenour Sameur is an Algerian army deserter who came to Britain in 1999 and was later granted refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan, accused of attending terror training camps linked to al-Qaeda, and sent to Guantanamo in June 2002. He was released along with Jamil Al-Banna and Omar Deghayes in December 2007. It isn't known what he did afterwards. Ahmed Errachidi is a Moroccan who came to London in the mid-1980s, where he worked as a chef. He was detained in Pakistan in 2002, for allegedly attending an al-Qaeda training camp, and sent to Guantanamo. He was released in May 2007 after his lawyers proved he had been working in London when he was accused of being at a training camp. He returned to his family in Morocco and has since written a book about his experiences in captivity on the Cuban island. Ahmed Belbacha is a former footballer from Algeria who came to Britain in 1999. He was detained in Pakistan and accused of being sent to Afghanistan by the radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri for terror training. He was transferred to Guantanamo in early 2002 and, despite being cleared for release five years later, freed only in 2014. Mr Belbacha was returned to Algeria after his lawyers received assurances he would be treated fairly and humanely. Originally from Saudi Arabia, Shaker Aamer was the last British resident to leave Guantanamo, having being held there without trial for 13 years. He was accused of being an associate of Osama Bin Laden. His lawyers say the case against him came from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. He was repatriated to the UK in 2015. In an interview with the BBC, he said the the best thing about being free was ""just to wake up and know that nobody's going to tell you what to do"". What does the future hold for Guantanamo?

"Water was pumped out from a tanker to simulate wet weather conditions Ferrari set the fastest lap for the second time in four days as the first pre-season test came to an end. Kimi Raikkonen was 0.897 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Lewis Hamilton did not run after Mercedes discovered an electrical problem with the car, while team-mate Valtteri Bottas was eighth-fastest. Williams were unable to test because of damage done to their car in a crash by rookie Lance Stroll on Wednesday. A chassis needed repairing after the 18-year-old Canadian spun into the barriers in his third off-track moment in two days. Williams said they ""aimed to be back on track"" for the start of the second and final test on Tuesday. Mercedes were afflicted by reliability problems for the first time in what has been an otherwise impressive first test, with the team stopping Bottas early when it discovered an anomaly in the computer data. Englishman Jolyon Palmer continued what has been an encouraging first test for Renault with the third fastest time. ""I am driving with such a big smile on my face because the car feels so nice to drive,"" Palmer said. ""Everything at the moment is pointing in a good direction."" Read more: 'I am like a kid on a rollercoaster ride' - drivers love 'fastest ever' new F1 cars The final day of the first test was intended for teams to try out a new range of wet tyres designed by Pirelli after criticisms last year. Drivers had asked for changes to the 'extreme' tyre, used in the heaviest rain, because it was too prone to aquaplaning. Haas driver Romain Grosjean said there had been ""a lot of progress made from last year"" but said the 'intermediate' tyre ""got destroyed a bit too early, so some work is to be done"". F1's pre-season testing schedule Latest F1 2017 car launch gallery Stroll, who is making his debut in F1 this season, is bringing considerable financial backing to Williams - said to be at least Â£20m this year. That is in addition to a similar amount last year, when the team provided him with an extensive test programme in a two-year-old car at circuits around the world to prepare him for his debut. But he has had a torrid introduction to F1 in Spain this week. Lance Stroll's Williams hit the wall at Turn Six during yesterday's pre-season testing On Tuesday, his first day in the 2017 Williams car, Stroll crashed at the high-speed Turn Nine after just 12 laps and damaged the front wing. Williams had to stop running for the day while the wing was sent back to their base in Oxfordshire for repairs and a new one was flown out for Wednesday. Stroll then completed 100 laps before crashing again at Turn Six. Williams engineering chief Rob Smedley said Stroll had been caught out by the lack of grip on cold tyres. ""Lance was out on cold tyres, on an out-lap with a lot of fuel in the car, and the tyre stepped away from him,"" Smedley said. ""He was an innocent victim of that happening and what should have been an innocuous sideways moment brought him around into the barrier and did some damage. That happens and we expect it to happen, there is no blame on his part."" The second and final pre-season test runs from 7-10 March, with the first race of the season in Australia on 24-26 March.

"This video can not be played 'Why I quit my dream job as a police detective' The lack of police investigators in the UK is in crisis, according to a new report. Former detectives have told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme why they have quit their jobs. Being a police officer was Angelina Dawson's dream job. It was ""all I ever wanted to do"", she says. A police officer who won commendations, she was ""dead chuffed"" when she finally became a detective helping to solve some of London's most serious crimes. ""I loved the challenge of trying to work out what happened and putting the pieces of the puzzle together and getting the result, getting to court when people are being convicted of terrible things,"" she says. ""You really feel you've made a difference. It was worth all of those long hours."" However, in February - after 10 years as a Metropolitan Police officer and having become a detective - she decided to walk away from the police. ""I decided it's not good for me, it's not good for my health. It is so pressurised now. There just isn't enough of us,"" she says. A shortage of detectives in the force meant some officers were having to investigate up to 20 crimes at once, she says. Angelina at her passing out parade, in 2007 ""That is a massive workload, that's a minimum of 20 victims, a minimum of 20 suspects,"" she says. ""There just isn't enough hours in a day to do everything."" Eventually, she says, the job began to harm her health, at which point she decided to leave it behind, albeit with a heavy heart. ""I would often wake up with headaches because I wasn't having enough sleep,"" she says. ""No matter how much you try to be organised at work and keep on top of everything, there was just more and more and more and there just wasn't enough of us to cope with what was coming in. ""I just ended up thinking I can't do this anymore. It made me feel a bit of a failure to be honest, that I couldn't stick at it. It made me sad."" Simon Davison says he quit the police rather than move to another team for a promotion Simon Davison, another former Met Police detective, says the workload in some CID units in the capital had become ""insurmountable"" before he left. Last month, he resigned as a detective in the Met's ""flying squad"" - a unit that investigates serious organised crime. He says he would have had to move away from his specialist unit in order to win a promotion. However, he took the decision to quit the force altogether rather than transfer to one of London's 32 borough constabularies, where he says numbers have been ""decimated"". ""They've often got one detective sergeant and a trainee detective and that's it for the borough,"" he says. ""It only takes a couple of serious incidents and they are completely stretched. ""So I certainly noticed that going into the CID offices, that they just had very few numbers and you could sense the morale was quite down."" The seemingly glamorous lure of becoming a police detective and catching some of London's most fearsome criminals has also diminished, according to Mr Davison. ""The mystique of the CID has gone,"" he says. ""It used to be something that you aspired to but now I think something where you are either put or it is seen as the easy way out. ""I've seen departments with very few people. ""The experience has gone, and they just have an insurmountable work load."" The Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report on police effectiveness describes the shortage of investigators - including detectives - as a ""national crisis"", calling for a UK-wide response. ""Some crimes are apparently being shelved without proper investigations taking place,"" the report says. Inspectors say the Met Police is currently short of 700 detectives, and they are ""very concerned"" that too often officers without the right skills and experience are investigating crimes. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file police officers, says the overall number of officers in London has not reduced. Instead, the organisation says, cuts to civilian staff numbers have piled more pressure on officers, while there are also fewer people coming forward to join CID. It is urging forces to make the role of a detective constable more appealing. The Met said in a statement that ""detective recruitment and retention is being addressed as a priority"". ""In an organisation as large and complex as ours, ensuring we have the right people in the right roles to deal with an ever changing pattern of demand will always be very challenging, even more so in the current financial climate,"" the force said. It added: ""The Met has more officers than ever before taking the detective exam."" The Home Office said in a statement: ""We have protected police funding through the 2015 Spending Review, and the public should be in no doubt that forces will continue to have the resources they need to cut crime and keep our communities safe.""

"Ed Sheeran: ""I think this year is going to be the high point of my career"" In the first part of our exclusive interview with Ed Sheeran, the singer talked about writing 10 different versions of his third album, Ã· (Divide), and revealed he had a song ""better than Thinking Out Loud"". Ed Sheeran: 'I've topped Thinking Out Loud' In this, the second part, we delve deeper, using Ã· (Divide)'s song titles as the jumping off point for a series of random, but revealing questions. So, if you want to know how he burned his foot on a volcano, what he bought his girlfriend for Christmas, or when Taylor Swift's new album is coming out, read on. You erased yourself from social media last year. Was that for peace of mind? My mind was definitely more settled. I didn't have as much anxiety, because I didn't have as many people wanting things from me. Or I wasn't aware of the people who wanted things from me. Also, I started having conversations with people, rather than just going into my phone. Is it true you got rid of your phone completely? I don't have one at all. It's amazing. I was at a house party the other day and 50% of the people were either Snapchatting or watching Snapchat. Someone said: ""Why don't you have a phone any more?"" and I was like: ""Look around you. This is exactly why I don't have a phone."" Planet Earth II: Essential viewing at Ed Sheeran's House Now that you can afford to live in a castle, how do you make your songs relatable to fans? It doesn't matter how relevant they are. My song Don't isn't very relevant to my fans. They aren't going to ""four cities on two planes on the same day"". But the truth of the song is the frustration and anger [of being cheated on]. Everyone can relate to that. So the key is truth. Just be honest. On your last album, you sang about watching Blue Planet. Did you catch Planet Earth II? I was a massive fan of Planet Earth II. I was actually saying we should put David Attenborough in bubble wrap for 2017, because we can't lose another legend. Whose death affected you most last year? The George Michael thing really took me by surprise, because he was so young. He's younger than my dad. I had a party for New Year, and people played George Michael tunes the whole night. It was amazing to see how many people were made happy by his music. He really did affect a lot of people in a positive way, and it's just so, so sad for someone like that to go so young. This video can not be played His albums are called +, x and Ã· but how good is Ed Sheeran at maths? You burst your eardrum diving off a yacht two years ago. Were you worried it would affect your career? Well, I was born without an eardrum in that ear. I got it replaced when I was 11, then I burst it when I was 18 and again I was 24. It's actually quite a common thing, so I wasn't worried. I only have about 25% hearing in that ear anyway. What are the best and worst diet tips you've been given? I was hanging out with a model ages ago, and she used to dip cotton wool balls in diet Pepsi and that would be her meal for the day. That's a bad diet tip. The best tip is to eat what you want and exercise every day. It doesn't have to be a lot of exercise. Just keep your metabolism up. What's your poison? Beer is my biggest poison because beer puts on the most weight, and I can really guzzle beer. But now I tend to have one beer then move to spirits, rather than drinking beer all night. Is that better for hangovers? Well, my hangovers are quite bad. I find if you smoke cigarettes, your hangovers are horrendous. A friend of mine swears you can avoid a hangover by drinking two cups of tea before you go to bed. Yeah. I've been told to down a pint of water before you go to bed, and then you'll feel fine. Apparently, flat Sprite in the morning is a good cure too. The star is anxious to tour his new album, and says he's rehearsed all the songs already What is the perfect song? Something that makes you feel - whether it be happy or sad or whatever. I heard George Benson's Give Me The Night the other day, and it just made me smile and want to dance. The best songs of last year are the ones that came on the radio and you're like: ""Yes, yeah."" You never want to hear a song that makes you go: ""Nyeh, that's all right."" Galway's called the ""city of tribes"". What's your tribe? Suffolk folk - we're quite easy going, we all own bicycles  and we like our ale. Is that song a cover of the Steve Earle classic? No, it's an original. I actually tried to find another lyric. I did Wexford Girl and Clonakity Girl and Cork Girl... none of them worked. But the whole point of folk songs is taking inspiration from the past and making something new - so people will just have to deal with it. Ed Sheeran's cats: ""I'll give them medicine, then they'll cough it up in my hand. That's quite cute, actually."" What's currently making you happy? Or sad, for that matter. I'll tell you what's making me happy-sad: my cats. They've got flu, but they're just really cute. When they sneeze, that's a happy-sadness. It's like ""Aah,"" but also ""Ugh."" What's the worst injury you've ever had? I put my foot in a boiling pool of water when I was up a volcano. That was pretty bad... but when you asked that, my hand started twitching - so maybe it's that. What happened? I smashed a bottle of beer into my hand and got 12 stitches before a gig. Then I played the gig and split them open again while playing. It almost hit a tendon and meant I wouldn't be able to use this hand to play guitar. So, yeah, that was the worst injury I've had. I'm actually getting a bit twitchy thinking about it. Ed Sheeran will pose for a selfie - but he's thrown away his own smartphone Have you ever advised a girl to dump her boyfriend because you had a crush on her? Probably, when I was 14. Not since then. Not when it's been a serious relationship. Because I don't really have much else to offer. I can't be like: ""You should leave your boyfriend,"" and then disappear off on tour for four years. Given your lyrics, do people think you're wise romantically? Do they ask for advice? I'm great at advice, yeah. I give the best advice. I just won't always follow it. Do you read your own press? Yeah, all of it. At the beginning I got a bit upset, but you can't sell 22 million albums, then read a review by one person and be like: ""No-one likes me."" But I used to have a hit list. I remembered the people who didn't help, and then if they asked: ""Do you want to go on the cover of our magazine?"" I'd be like: ""Hell, no."" The list doesn't really exist any more. It was just in the very early stage of my career. Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran got together for a jam session last June, according to this photo on her Instagram account What's been the high point of the past five years? I think this year is going to be the high point. I have a feeling about it.  Seventeen is my lucky number, and everyone I was scared of releasing of albums around me released them all last year - people like Beyonce and The Weekend and Bruno Mars. Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year - Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records. So I've got a full year of just all Ed, all the time. What's the least romantic present you've ever bought? I bought my girlfriend a penknife for Christmas. Not romantic, but she wanted one. I got her a penknife, and she got me a Tech Deck - you know, those finger-sized skateboards you used to play with in school? So you listened to what she wanted and bought her it? That's the definition of romantic. OK. Do you know what? I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, and they had that new Dyson hairdryer advert - and all the girls around me, all these mums and daughters, were going, ""Oh, that looks great."" So I was like: ""[clicks fingers] Sorted for Christmas."" So that's probably the least romantic sentiment. Ed Sheeran's new album, Ã· (Divide), is released on Friday, 3 March, by Atlantic Records.

" The majority of us have exactly the same lunch every day. More than a third of office workers have eaten the same midday meal for the last nine months. Depressing, isn’t it? But how can we break out of our lunchtime automatic pilot and eat something that will taste good, do us good and that we’ll actually remember eating? Sheila Dillon on theFood Programmegives us some facts and tips on eating something that yells “look at my lunch!” The average lunch hour is now 25 minutes and 24 seconds. Not much of an hour, is it? Particularly when the majority of lunches are spent typing one-handed whilst wielding a cheese and pickle sandwich. The average spend per week on lunch is £5.70. If you’re under 35 you are spending £7.20. But it’s on the SAME SORT OF SANDWICH. Every blooming day. Wow, we love our bread in this country. Sandwiches used to be an emergency snack, what you’d eat on a train, when travelling, when you didn’t have time for a proper meal. Now they’ve become a mainstay. We bring food from home on average three times a week. Just don’t be the person that brings in their tuna and egg bake and leaves it sweltering in the open microwave for hours... Breakfast is pretty much the same every day, so why shouldn’t lunch be? Isn’t it simply efficient? Philosopher Julian Baggini says we see lavish lunches as being somewhat decadent. The English see dinner as the one meal in which their routine can be varied. But we’re never going to break out of our midday malaise unless we think outside the (sandwich) box. What does your lunch say about you? Ottolenghi style is going to be on trend for this summer. Fava bean salad wrap, for instance. Just don’t chuck it down your Michael Kors while you’re eating al desko. If we eat together, we achieve more. A study run by Cornell University showed that people who ate together, worked better together. And shared their crisps, which is clearly vital for co-operation. Bee Wilson suggests a bento box (basically Japanese for lunch box). In Japan there’d be a colourful selection of carbohydrate, protein and vegetable. It doesn’t have to be a Heston Blumenthal creation, or something with a jus, just treat yourself as if you’re worth cooking for, and you’ll find your lunch ups its game. You don’t need super-expensive equipment in the office to cook yourself a lunch. How to cook yourself an exciting lunch in the office No need for bread ovens or pasta makers – a microwave and a kettle will allow you to make a huge variety of hot, satisfying midday meals. With no crumbs. So there we are. Time to become a legend in your own lunchtime. Sheila Dillon unpacks the future of lunch. We have gathered together some astonishing citrus facts. Real ale names, or did we invent them? Professor Nicola Humble shares surprising facts about cake.",Negative,6.803766e-16
