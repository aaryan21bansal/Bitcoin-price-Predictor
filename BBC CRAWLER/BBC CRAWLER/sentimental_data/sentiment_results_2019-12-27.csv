"George Michael's sister, Melanie Panayiotou, has died aged 59, exactly three years after her brother. The family confirmed in a statement that Melanie ""passed away suddenly"" over Christmas.

Melanie and George - whose mother Lesley died in 1997 - are survived by their father Kyriacos, known as Jack, and their oldest sister Yioda. In a statement, released through lawyer John Reid, Melanie's family said: ""We would simply ask that the family's privacy be respected at this very sad time. Pop superstar George Michael dies at 53 George Michael post-mortem 'inconclusive' ""There will be no further comment."" George Michael had hits with Wham! and as a solo artist The Metropolitan Police also confirmed the death in a statement, which read: ""Police were called by London Ambulance Service at approximately 1935hrs on Wednesday, 25 December to reports of the sudden death of a woman, aged in her 50s.

"The deadline for negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU may need to be extended, the European Commission president has said. Boris Johnson has said the post-Brexit transition period will not be extended beyond 31 December 2020. But Ursula von der Leyentold French newspaper Les Echos,externalboth sides needed to think seriously about whether this was enough time to reach an agreement. She said she was ""very worried"" about how little time was available. ""It would be reasonable to evaluate the situation mid-year and then, if necessary, agree on extending the transition period,"" she told the paper. Last week MPs backed Mr Johnson's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January, which included a new clause prohibiting the government from extending the transition period beyond the end of 2020. During this 11-month period, the UK will cease to be an EU member but its trading relationship will remain the same and it will continue to follow the EU's rules, such as accepting rulings from the European Court of Justice. It will also continue to contribute to the EU's budget. The UK will use the time to negotiate a free trade deal as well as other aspects of its future relationship with the EU, including law enforcement, security and access to fishing waters. Earlier this month, Ms von der Leyen said the timeframe was ""extremely short"" to discuss not only trade, but also other issues. If negotiators fail to agree a trade deal by the deadline and no extension is agreed, this would leave the UK trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms with the EU, with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports. If other aspects of the future relationship are not ready, they too would have to proceed onno-deal terms. Ms von der Leyen, a former German defence minister and long-time close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, replaced Jean-Claude Juncker as European Commission president earlier this month. The Commission drafts EU laws, enforces EU rules and has the power to impose fines on member states if necessary. What is the transition period? How soon will Brexit happen? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Meanwhile,the Times reports,externalthat the European Commission will warn Britain that access from the City of London to European markets would be jeopardised unless Britain aligns closely with European regulations. According to the paper, EU chiefs will threaten to block access unless both sides agree on two key issues - equivalence in financial services, meaning the UK's rules on financial regulation are deemed in effect as good as those of the EU, and adequacy, which means Britain's level of data protection is comparable to that of EU law. Failure to be granted ""data adequacy"" could inhibit vital EU data being shared with Britain for trade, security and medicine. The Financial Times,externalquotes a senior European official as saying the UK is at ""the end of the queue"" for a deal to allow data to continue to flow freely with the EU after Brexit. Wojciech Wiewiorowski, the EU's new data protection supervisor, told the paper that assessing the UK's data adequacy would be a lengthy process which may fall down the list of priorities in negotiations. MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 January Brexit bill to rule out extension What happens after Brexit? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean?

"The Treasury is reportedly planning to rewrite rules governing public spending in a move that may benefit areas in the Midlands and North of England. The changes,reported by the Times,external, would make it easier for cash to be allocated to projects outside of London and the South East. It could help boost investment in infrastructure, business development projects and schemes like free ports. The Treasury has not denied the reports. Current rules require government to allocate cash to projects that promise the biggest economic benefits. Those projects tend to have most impact in areas with more people and businesses. But under the new plans, reported on Friday, investment decisions would be made with a focus on reducing inequality between northern and southern England, rather than promoting overall economic growth across the country. It will affect decisions made about projects ranging from rail improvements to investment in scientific research. By Colletta Smith, BBC business correspondent After Boris Johnson's electoral wins in northern England, the pressure is on to deliver on promises to spend more money improving road and rail links, and increase productivity beyond the South East. Sources at the Treasury suggest there will some big changes at the next budget this spring. At the moment, projects are given the go-ahead based on how much money they would add per person, which favours heavily populated areas, and tends to attract more funding to London. New rules would allow money to be spent on different criteria - improving wellbeing and productivity imbalances across the country. That includes transport schemes and scientific research and development. ""A big project in the North will often be stimulating growth, which wouldn't otherwise happen,"" said Henri Murison from the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which speaks for business and civic leaders across northern England. But, in the South, that investment will help a regional economy that is already expected to grow significantly, he told the BBC. ""If the UK is going to succeed post-Brexit, we need to get comparable levels of growth in the North and in the Midlands,"" he said. But Tom Forth from the Open Data Institute Leeds said the rules on value for money were not to blame for regional spending disparities. ""For as long as we have records, far more UK government money has been invested in public transport in south-east England than in the cities of north England and the Midlands,"" he said. ""There is no evidence that this was because investing in London offered better value for money. ""The rules say the Treasury should invest with preference to schemes with higher value for money. ""But there is no evidence that it has done that."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We work across government to ensure investment is focused on where it is needed across the UK and delivers value for money for the taxpayer."" After his election victory, Boris Johnsonthanked voters in northern Englandfor ""breaking the voting habits of generations"" and placing their trust in the Conservatives.

"A CCTV image shows Anthony Knott in Market Street walking back towards the pub An image of the last known sighting of missing firefighter Anthony Knott has been released by police. The 33-year-old was last seen at a pub in Lewes, East Sussex, during a work night out on Friday 20 December. He had been with a group of friends at The Lamb pub in Fisher Street, but for unknown reasons he left the premises alone at about 19:16 GMT. The image shows him walking up Market Street - towards the pub - at 19:41, 20 minutes after his phone was turned off. Specialist teams have carried out extensive searches of the area surrounding the pub and the open-air Pells Pool area, which has been severely affected by flood water over the past few days. Ch Insp Sarah Godley said: ""We have reviewed CCTV footage from a number of premises such as homes and businesses, and we are continuing to retrieve and review further footage as we attempt to find out what happened to Anthony. ""Our searches have included local officers, drones and the dog unit, and we have also been assisted by London Fire Brigade, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, the National Police Air Service helicopter, Sussex Search and Rescue and the Coastguard agency in our quest to locate Anthony."" The firefighter was due home in the early hours of 21 December She said: ""The area we have searched includes Pells Pool and Pellbrook Cut, as well as bins, street furniture, alleyways and dark areas. ""In addition to the local area, we have also extended our search of the River Ouse north towards Hamsey."" Ch Insp Godley added that a further search of the Pells Pool area and the river would be carried out over the weekend as the natural water level falls. ""We will continue to search for Anthony until we get the answers his family are so desperately seeking. Seven days on, our priority remains to find him,"" she said. Police have said they are ""growing increasingly concerned"" for Mr Knott's welfare. There have been no signs that the 33-year-old, who had been due to return home to Orpington in the early hours of Saturday, had left the town.

"The retiring president of the Supreme Court says legal aid cuts in England and Wales have caused ""serious difficulty"" to the justice system. Baroness Hale, who was guest editing BBC Radio 4's Today, said it was a particular problem in family courts. In 2013, legal aid was removed from many civil law cases to achieve a saving of Â£350 million a year. The government said it was piloting early legal advice in some welfare cases, plus extra financial support. Baroness Hale of Richmond, who retires next month, is the first female president of the Supreme Court, which is the final court of appeal in the UK. She said: ""I don't think that anybody who has anything to do with the justice system of England and Wales could fail to be concerned about the problems which the reduction in resources in several directions has caused for the system as a whole."" Legal aid network 'decimated' by cuts Five things you might not know about Lady Hale Baroness Hale: The legal trailblazer The outgoing president said the problem was particularly evident in family courts. Lady Hale said: ""It's unreasonable to expect a husband and wife or mother and father who are in crisis in their personal relationship to make their own arrangements without help."" She said in such family dispute cases ""there may be an imbalance in resources because of the lack of access"". Most people require legal help at the beginning of cases, she said. This video can not be played ""There was a gasp in the courtroom"" - retiring Supreme Court President Lady Hale Additional resources would allow many disputes to be resolved at an early stage, without the need to go to court or stretch their finances, she added. ""It is that lack of initial advice and help which is a serious difficulty."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are improving early legal support to reduce the number of people going to court unnecessarily and prevent undue stress and costs. ""We are piloting early legal advice in certain welfare cases, have committed Â£5 million for a Legal Support Innovation Fund to identify and resolve legal problems, and will soon launch an awareness campaign to improve understanding of entitlements. ""This is on top of Â£1.7 billion we spent on legal aid last year and ongoing work to improve the Exceptional Case Funding scheme and legal aid means testing."" The BBC found last year thatabout a million fewer claims for legal aidare being processed each year, with ""deserts"" of provision across England and Wales. Lady Hale turns 75 years old next month, which is the mandatory retirement age for judges appointed before 1995. She made headlines in September when shedelivered the Supreme Court's ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decisionto suspend Parliament was unlawful. Legal aid is the money provided by the government to cover legal costs for those who cannot afford them. Cuts to legal aid came into effect on 1 April, 2013 as part of the government's plan to save Â£350 million a year. The changes meant that some types of cases, such as divorce, welfare benefits, child contact, housing law and employment were no longer eligible for public funds. Such cuts have proved controversial, with the Criminal Bar Association, which represents criminal lawyers in England and Wales,advising its members last year to strike. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the CBA, said that underfunding meant the poor and vulnerable were ""being denied access to justice"".

"The UK's competition watchdog is investigating Amazon's bid to buy a stake in food delivery firm Deliveroo. Earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)gave the two firms a weekto address worries that the deal could affect competition. But, on Friday, the regulator said Amazon had failed to deal with ""initial concerns that their investment in Deliveroo could be bad for customers, restaurants and grocers"". The review could last up to six months. The CMA has been looking at theÂ£440m dealsince it was announced in May. However, the regulator said Amazon and Deliveroo had failed to offer any undertakings to address its concerns by a December 18 deadline. Why is the takeaway war hotting up? The in-depth investigation threatens to jeopardise Amazon's attempt to break into the UK food delivery space. The CMA is worried that Amazon's plans to invest in Deliveroo could stop it from launching a rival company, which would increase competition and potentially lower prices for consumers. Announcing that it was considering a thorough probe into the deal, the CMA's executive director, Andrea Gomes da Silva, said: ""Millions of people in the UK use online food platforms for takeaways, and more than ever are making use of similar services for the same-day delivery of groceries. ""There are relatively few players in these markets, so we're concerned that Amazon having this kind of influence over Deliveroo could dampen the emerging competition between the two businesses."" She said that if the deal were to go ahead in its current form then there was a ""real risk"" that customers, restaurants and grocers would face higher prices and lower quality services. In a statement, Amazon said the deal would lead to more innovation and allow Deliveroo to remain competitive. Meanwhile, Deliveroo said: ""We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers."" It is not the first time Amazon has tried to enter the food delivery market in the UK. The online retailer briefly ran its own delivery venture, Amazon Restaurants UK, which it started in 2016 but closed just two years later. It was previously reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright. Uber alsoreportedly had talkswith Deliveroo regarding an interest in buying it.

"The Treasury is reportedly planning to rewrite rules governing public spending in a move that may benefit areas in the Midlands and North of England. The changes,reported by the Times,external, would make it easier for cash to be allocated to projects outside of London and the South East. It could help boost investment in infrastructure, business development projects and schemes like free ports. The Treasury has not denied the reports. Current rules require government to allocate cash to projects that promise the biggest economic benefits. Those projects tend to have most impact in areas with more people and businesses. But under the new plans, reported on Friday, investment decisions would be made with a focus on reducing inequality between northern and southern England, rather than promoting overall economic growth across the country. It will affect decisions made about projects ranging from rail improvements to investment in scientific research. By Colletta Smith, BBC business correspondent After Boris Johnson's electoral wins in northern England, the pressure is on to deliver on promises to spend more money improving road and rail links, and increase productivity beyond the South East. Sources at the Treasury suggest there will some big changes at the next budget this spring. At the moment, projects are given the go-ahead based on how much money they would add per person, which favours heavily populated areas, and tends to attract more funding to London. New rules would allow money to be spent on different criteria - improving wellbeing and productivity imbalances across the country.

"Kirk Ellis contracted hepatitis C as a child Welsh victims of the contaminated blood scandal are being used as ""political footballs"", a help group has said. Charity Haemophilia Wales said it was concerned victims were dying without getting the financial support they deserved due to differences in how much money is paid out across the UK. Payments to victims in England were increased this year withthe inquiry judge calling for parityelsewhere. Wales's health minister has blamed the hold-up on the UK election. In July, Vaughan Gething said he wanted the issue resolved quickly but no changes have yet been made to the payments in Wales, which are the responsibility of the Welsh Government According to Haemophilia Wales, that leaves Welsh victims about Â£10,000 a year worse off compared with their English counterparts. The Welsh Government said it was working with the other UK nations towards financial parity and support. Up to 30,000 people were infected with contaminated blood and blood products in the 1970s and 80s. More than six months after first speaking to BBC Wales about the issue, Kirk Ellis, 38, from Caerphilly, said he was frustrated he is still thousands of pounds worse off. ""Personally I don't' think they're bothered about us,"" he said. ""To me I feel like they've just shrugged us off. I just feel like we're discriminated against."" Mr Ellis receives Â£18,500 a year after he contracted hepatitis C when he was given infected blood as a child. Engaged to be married and with a three-year-old son, Mr Ellis stressed the importance of including widows in the Welsh scheme - as is the case in Scotland. ""I worry that I might not be here is six months or a year's time. I'm trying to save money so that I know that there's some sort of safety net there for them but, on the payments we're getting, it's just not high enough. ""I just feel I can't give my partner and my son any security. That's what really hurts is I feel like I'm letting them down."" Inquiry in figures 30,000potential number of infected people 2,400estimated deaths 10.2mdocuments being investigated 2,500written statements expected by inquiry 150staff working on inquiry At least 300 victims in Wales Manslaughter claim against consultant Anger after boy, 7, died from Aids What is the contaminated blood scandal? Ministers urged to take the lead Families give testimonies to inquiry Haemophilia Wales says families are being pushed ""from pillar to post"" A public inquiry into the scandal is currently looking at why thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. At least 300 people in Wales are known to have been infected, but this does not include others who have died or may not have known they were infected. Even though Haemophilia Wales chairman Lynne Kelly says ""ultimately the fault is with the UK government"", she believes the Welsh Government should do more to help victims and their families.

"Rail passengers are being warned to expect disruption as major engineering work takes place in Edinburgh. Network Rail is renewing four sets of points and replacing 250m of track at Haymarket East junction, to the west of the station. Many services will be affected as the junction is one Scotland's busiest, used by up to 30 trains an hour. No trains will be able to pass through Haymarket and replacement buses will operate into Waverley from the west. ScotRail service alterations,external Normal services are due to resume on all routes from 10:00 on Sunday. The upgrade is aimed at improving the reliability of the track but requires several days of work. It has been scheduled for the holiday period to minimise disruption, as there were no ScotRail services into Edinburgh on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. ScotRail is urging customers to consider making alternative arrangements as the work continues into Friday and Saturday. Many services will terminate before reaching Edinburgh, with only limited replacement transport available. Details of affected services are available at theScotRail website.,external Network Rail said engineers would be working round the clock on track renewal Liam Sumpter, Network Rail Scotland route director, said: ""Haymarket East junction is a key part of Scotland's Railway and is used by hundreds of trains a day travelling to destinations across Scotland and England. ""We understand the inconvenience this work will cause to some passengers, but renewing such a complex piece of our railway cannot be accomplished without a short-term closure of the line. ""Our engineers have carefully planned this project to be completed as quickly as possible and we are working hard alongside our train operators to keep passengers informed of the changes to services during this important investment in the railway."" Nick King, spokesman for Network Rail, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme: ""So far work is progressing very well so we are expecting the job to be completed as planned as engineers are working around the clock."" Efforts to improve the line in Glasgow took place on Christmas Day and Boxing Day with engineers renewing 300m of track at Shields Road.

"A huge country the size of Western Europe, Kazakhstan has vast mineral resources and enormous economic potential. The varied landscape stretches from the mountainous, heavily populated regions of the east to the sparsely populated, energy-rich lowlands in the west, and from the industrialised north, with its Siberian climate and terrain, through the arid, empty steppes of the centre, to the fertile south. Ethnically the former Soviet republic is as diverse, with a large Russian minority in the north and smaller minorities in the south and east. Suppressed under Soviet rule, the main religion, Islam, is undergoing a revival. Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid economic growth, and eased some of the stark disparities in wealth of the 1990s.

"The retiring president of the Supreme Court says legal aid cuts in England and Wales have caused ""serious difficulty"" to the justice system. Baroness Hale, who was guest editing BBC Radio 4's Today, said it was a particular problem in family courts. In 2013, legal aid was removed from many civil law cases to achieve a saving of Â£350 million a year. The government said it was piloting early legal advice in some welfare cases, plus extra financial support. Baroness Hale of Richmond, who retires next month, is the first female president of the Supreme Court, which is the final court of appeal in the UK. She said: ""I don't think that anybody who has anything to do with the justice system of England and Wales could fail to be concerned about the problems which the reduction in resources in several directions has caused for the system as a whole."" Legal aid network 'decimated' by cuts Five things you might not know about Lady Hale Baroness Hale: The legal trailblazer The outgoing president said the problem was particularly evident in family courts. Lady Hale said: ""It's unreasonable to expect a husband and wife or mother and father who are in crisis in their personal relationship to make their own arrangements without help."" She said in such family dispute cases ""there may be an imbalance in resources because of the lack of access"". Most people require legal help at the beginning of cases, she said. This video can not be played ""There was a gasp in the courtroom"" - retiring Supreme Court President Lady Hale Additional resources would allow many disputes to be resolved at an early stage, without the need to go to court or stretch their finances, she added. ""It is that lack of initial advice and help which is a serious difficulty."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are improving early legal support to reduce the number of people going to court unnecessarily and prevent undue stress and costs. ""We are piloting early legal advice in certain welfare cases, have committed Â£5 million for a Legal Support Innovation Fund to identify and resolve legal problems, and will soon launch an awareness campaign to improve understanding of entitlements. ""This is on top of Â£1.7 billion we spent on legal aid last year and ongoing work to improve the Exceptional Case Funding scheme and legal aid means testing."" The BBC found last year thatabout a million fewer claims for legal aidare being processed each year, with ""deserts"" of provision across England and Wales. Lady Hale turns 75 years old next month, which is the mandatory retirement age for judges appointed before 1995. She made headlines in September when shedelivered the Supreme Court's ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decisionto suspend Parliament was unlawful. Legal aid is the money provided by the government to cover legal costs for those who cannot afford them. Cuts to legal aid came into effect on 1 April, 2013 as part of the government's plan to save Â£350 million a year. The changes meant that some types of cases, such as divorce, welfare benefits, child contact, housing law and employment were no longer eligible for public funds. Such cuts have proved controversial, with the Criminal Bar Association, which represents criminal lawyers in England and Wales,advising its members last year to strike. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the CBA, said that underfunding meant the poor and vulnerable were ""being denied access to justice"".

"Black Friday discounts and bad weather have been blamed for a decline in Boxing Day shoppers, with retail analysts reporting a fall in the number of people heading for the sales. Springboard, which analyses customer activity in stores, said footfall had seen the largest decline since 2011, dropping by 8.6%. It said Boxing Day was becoming less important as a trading day. But there were still queues for some shops from as early as 04:30 GMT. However, the retail data analyst, which examines information from UK High Street and shopping centre cameras, said more people were waiting until later in the day to head to the shops in search of a bargain. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""It is clear that consumers visited high streets more in the early evening than during the day."" By lunchtime on Boxing Day, footfall was 10.6% lower than last year, its biggest annual decline since 2010, when Springboard first published its data. Commenting on the disappointing morning for retailers, Ms Wehrle said many consumers were still celebrating Christmas with their family on Boxing Day, while the rainy weather, online shopping and increased Black Friday spending were also possible factors for the drop in footfall. ""Boxing Day is indisputably a less important trading day than it once was,"" Ms Wehrle said. Customers queue outside Selfridges in London ahead of the Boxing Day sale. Some bargain-hunters did brave the rain, with some shoppers on London's Oxford Street waiting for stores to open at 9am. Others queued outside Selfridges in Greater Manchester's Trafford Centre at 4.30am. As the doors to Next opened in Liverpool at 06:00 GMT, more than 150 people were waiting outside the store. All Zara clothes to be sustainable by 2025 Black Friday 'could break buying record' Loan sharks cash in on Black Friday spending spree A total of Â£3.7 billion was expected to be spent in the Boxing Day sales, according to Barclaycard, with four in 10 UK adults predicted to spend an average of Â£186 each. But environmental concerns were also expected to drive down buying, with shoppers also predicted to spend Â£200 million less in post-Christmas sales this year compared to last year.

The crowd lap it up like a collective communion. They respond with shrill blasts from their whistles. Their ears are ringing, but they can’t get enough of it. Even when the police or fire brigade raid the club. “Old Bill, Old Bill,” raps Hooligan X. It’s a coded warning. The drug dealers peddling ecstasy scurry into the shadows and stash their supplies. The fire exit pops open. There has always been a dark, sinister side to nightlife. “Everybody misses that time,” says one former regular at the club. “It was a feeling of being all loved up. But it became a very intimidating scene.” This was the dangerous world Lee Harrison moved in all his life. But it would catch up with him more than 25 years later. Lee Harrison was a face everyone knew around Middlesbrough. He was often seen bombing around town in his open-top convertible with the music blaring. “Lee would get where the wind doesn’t get but in a lovely cheeky way,” says his childhood friend, Alan Appleton. “He was a good-looking lad and could get any woman he wanted. You would see photographs of him with Mike Tyson and you would just snigger, ‘Yup, that’s the Lee we know’.” But for all Lee’s charm, there was a violent side to him. Someone who knew him said he pulled a gun on him during an argument. A friend recalls Lee spiking his drink with hallucinogenic drugs for a laugh. Lee Harrison and friend Lee Duffy, a former boxer, bouncer and gangster who was known as one of the most feared men on Teesside in the 80s Lee Harrison was born on 8 March 1966. He was of mixed race. His mother was of Burmese-Portuguese origin. His father, Tom Harrison, is by his own admission an “old villain” who has spent much of his life cycling in and out of jail – including, he says, a 30-month sentence for conspiracy to supply drugs from Pakistan in the early 80s. But more about drugs later. Lee grew up in the North Ormesby area of the town, which now has the enviable record of being one of the cheapest places to buy a house in the UK. During Lee’s childhood, it was a solid working-class neighbourhood where everybody knew everyone; where doors were left unlocked and children would play football or ride their bikes in the streets. Lee was an excellent junior boxer. He was known for his looks and didn’t like getting hit in the face. Being handy with his fists came in useful a few years later when he got involved in football hooliganism. The Middlesbrough Frontline followed their beloved team around the country, fighting pitched battles against rival fans. “We would get guys from all the nearby estates,” says Paul Slater, who was a member of the Frontline. “It wasn’t about the violence, it was about gaining respect for our hometown. Lee loved it. He loved the attention.” It was those bloody Saturday afternoons that inspired his MC name: Hooligan X. Lee left school with no qualifications and immediately started helping his dad out in the “copying game”. At one stage it was mainly counterfeit clothing. “We used to get bundles of gear, tracksuits and trainers - that was the fashion then - and sell it all over the north-east,” says Tom.  But they also had a sideline in fake Rolex watches and perfumes. “We’d get the bottles in Romania, the essence from France, and the boxes were made in Birmingham. It was all done professionally. It would cost you about two quid to make a bottle of Coco Chanel.” It was a life of crime that paid for flash clothes, fast cars and fancy foreign trips. But music was always Lee’s passion. “As a six-year-old when we were invited to weddings, he’d be on the dance floor,” says Tom. “He was unbelievable.” Lee’s love of music was inherited from his dad. Tom ran the doors at the Speakeasy, a nightclub that later became the Havana, and had a huge record collection. The pair listened to reggae, particularly Bob Marley. Lee spent summers working in Spanish resorts. He started by handing out flyers for nightclubs but graduated to working as a DJ. “People just wanted to dance their tits off all night,” says Alan, who accompanied Lee on one trip and was later to become a DJ at the Havana. “They were just lost in the music.” It was in places like Ibiza and Tenerife that many British clubbers first experimented with ecstasy – and later started taking it back to the UK. During his time in Spain, Lee mixed with DJs who were later to become some of the biggest names in the British club scene. In Middlesbrough, a local club owner put him in charge of entertainment at the Havana and later the Arena nightclub in the town. The 1990s proved to be boom times. The money was rolling in. But it all came to a shocking end for Lee in 2001. It’s been described as one of Middlesbrough’s most notorious murders. A 41-year-old market trader,Kalvant Singh, was found dead after falling from the window of a house in the town. But it soon became clear that it was no accident and he had been pushed out of the window. A local news website said that Mr Singh had “found himself in the middle of a so-called turf war concerning the supply, distribution and sale of drugs to prostitutes in Teesside and Middlesbrough”. Kalvant Singh Four men were wanted in connection with the murder. One of them was Lee. He went on the run to Scotland, South Africa, Amsterdam, and finally to Jamaica. His family used to take holidays on the island and had friends there. After a year, Lee was arrested and extradited back to the UK. In 2004, he received a nine-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and wounding. His father was also imprisoned for several years for trying to silence witnesses. Lee was freed from jail in 2009 and settled in Portsmouth. He was married to Tamara, whom he had met while on the run in Jamaica. He told friends that he was going to turn over a new leaf. He wanted to go straight. He found work as an electrical cable fitter. But things didn’t work out as he planned. In 2015, Lee’s marriage was falling apart. A few days before Christmas, he boarded a flight to Lebanon. He said he was going to spend the holiday with a Lebanese friend in the Bekaa Valley. It was a journey that ultimately cost him his life. Some 2,300 miles (3,700km) from Middlesbrough lies Lebanon’s magnificent Bekaa Valley. Running for 75 miles (121km), it’s flanked by snow-capped mountains on one side and war-torn Syria in the east. The Bekaa has long been known as the country’s breadbasket, famed for its Roman ruins and world-class wineries. But it’s also a wild frontier, a place where the police often fear to tread – there are thousands of outstanding arrest warrants. The Lebanese call them the Farreen - the fugitives. If you know the right people in the Bekaa you can get away with almost anything. Crime flourishes in this impoverished region. Smuggling over treacherous mountain paths is a rite of passage for many.  One of the valley’s towns is infamous for being a hub for stolen cars. But it’s what you find at the feet of Mount Lebanon’s slopes that brings us here – hectares and hectares of lush, green, cannabis plants, producing some of the finest resin in the world. Lee came to the Bekaa to stay at the home of a man called Adonis Al Masri, an inquest held in the UK after Lee’s death heard. Adonis has a brown, gingery beard. But if you looked closely you’d see it was covering scars. As a teenager in the 1980s, he was caught up in one of the bloody feuds that frequently erupt among the Bekaa’s sprawling families, which control the valley. Adonis was shot in the face. He’s had dozens of skin-graft operations to try to repair the damage done to his jaw. A relative says that the traumatic event warped his life – ever since he’s relied on drink and drugs to numb the pain and combat depression. They say he’s a volatile character prone to mood swings. Adonis and Lee knew each other from the UK. On one occasion, Adonis was introduced by Lee to his father - at a birthday party held at an Italian restaurant in London’s West End. Tom’s first impression was that Adonis “seemed all right”. It was a view shared by others.  But during the UK inquest, Lee’s half-brother, Gerald Copeman, was quoted as saying that Adonis claimed to have killed the man who had shot him in his face. Several friends also recall Adonis bragging of ties to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia organisation whose military wing is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK. Perhaps, most bizarrely of all, he boasted of having helped free the British hostage, Terry Waite, who was held in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s. One of Adonis’s relatives described this claim as complete fantasy. Whatever the truth, Adonis is from one of the most prominent and powerful families in the Bekaa Valley. His great grandfather, Mulhim Qasim Al Masri, was hailed as a courageous freedom fighter against Lebanon’s former Ottoman and French occupiers. Adonis’s grandfather, Nayef Al Masri, was a member of the Lebanese parliament from 1960 to 1972. Remember that name – we’ll be returning to him later. Adonis, himself, has political ties. He organised gatherings at his home for one of the main Lebanese political parties during the recent election. He posted pictures of himself on social media with top politicians. Anybody seeing those pictures would be left with the impression that Adonis is a man with powerful friends. Like almost everyone else in the Bekaa, Adonis had access to guns. It’s a way of life up in the valley.  During the UK inquest, Lee’s half-brother Andrew Harrison recalled a FaceTime call during which Lee showed him around what appeared to be the Al Masri family armoury. There were sub-machine guns and rocket launchers, according to Andrew. But as Lee walked out on to a balcony, Andrew was to get an even bigger surprise from what he saw earlier on the video call. “On the right-hand side there was a pile – I would estimate to be about five high and six feet wide – of brown-coloured powder that I recognised to be cannabis,” he was quoted as saying at the inquest. The court would hear that Lee was not in the Bekaa to celebrate Christmas after all. According to his family, he was in fact in Lebanon to do a drug deal. Four months later it would all go tragically wrong. Of all the illicit activity for which the Bekaa is renowned, nothing surpasses its drug production. The UN ranks Lebanon as the world’s third-largest producer of hashish - a psychoactive substance smoked or ingested, made from cannabis resin - after Morocco and Afghanistan. Lebanon is also a significant producer of fenethylline - an amphetamine-like pill better known as captagon - and a transit hub for cocaine and heroin. It’s hashish above all that’s made Lebanon’s name in the international drug world. In July 2018, the consulting firm McKinsey proposed legalising its cultivation and sale for medicinal use in order to invigorate Lebanon’s stagnant economy. The economy minister said it would amount to a billion-dollar industry, praising the quality of local produce as “one of the best in the world”. In the freewheeling late 60s, at the time of Woodstock, the Summer of Love, and radical counterculture, Lebanese hash was in vogue. “Pilgrims” would travel the “hippie trail” by minibus from Europe to Lebanon seeking enlightenment at the source, before journeying on to Afghanistan, India, and beyond. The Brotherhood of Eternal Love - a zany Californian group of surfers, stoners, and drug dealers dubbed the Hippie Mafia - was said by the US Drug Enforcement Administration to have imported almost two tonnes (or more than 4,000 lbs) of Lebanese hash to the US by the early 70s. Christina von Opel Other notable buyers included the car heiress Christina von Opel, arrested in St Tropez in 1977 with 1.6 tonnes of Lebanese hash, and the former Welsh smuggler and spy turned author Howard Marks, who arranged the transportation of hundreds of kilos of the drug using Lebanese diplomats, according to Jonathan Marshall in his book The Lebanese Connection: Corruption, Civil War, and the International Drug Traffic. Howard Marks The Lebanese civil war (1975-90) was a great boon to the industry, with the collapse of state authority and rise of rapacious militias with few scruples about making money by any means. The area of farmland used for hash cultivation grew to four times its pre-war size; estimated at 10,000 hectares (roughly 10,000 rugby pitches). Not just hash but heroin, too, began to be produced in large quantities, and the warlords who controlled the supply lines and seaports amassed vast fortunes. After the war, the heroin was mostly stamped out, and the hash farmland much reduced, though far from eradicated. The Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, a prominent force in the Bekaa, has been accused of involvement in the drugs trade in Lebanon and overseas. But the organisation has dismissed allegations that it’s involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Recent years have seen the introduction of captagon, a stimulant reportedly consumed by fighters in the Syrian conflict, as well as recreational users in Gulf Arab states. Captagon was originally the name of a pharmaceutical drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. But it was banned in most countries during the 1980s because of its addictive properties. Now captagon is reportedly the most popular drug consumed in the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia.  While these deeply conservative Islamic states take a strict zero-tolerance approach towards all intoxicants, users appear to be drawn to captagon in the belief they're taking “medication”. A decade ago, captagon was produced in Bulgaria and other countries in south-east  Europe, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. But in recent years, production appears to have shifted to Lebanon and Syria. Experts believe the illegal trade to be worth hundreds of million dollars a year. In Lebanon itself, seizures of the drug have soared. In 2012, the authorities seized 79kg of captagon but by 2016 it had rocketed to 2,175kg. Amphetamine and captagon trafficking flows 2014-2015 (Source: UNODC) Throughout these decades, the illegality of the drug trade has been circumvented by official corruption, at times implicating figures in Lebanon’s highest offices. And members of the Al Masri clan have played their own part. Remember Adonis’s grandfather, Nayef Al Masri, the Lebanese MP? Well, in 1970, a plane was seized in Crete carrying more than half a tonne of hashish worth more than $1m at the time. According to the book The Secret War Against Dope by Andrew Tully, the plane had taken off from a freshly-constructed airstrip on Nayef’s estate in the Bekaa. It appears, then, that Adonis was no stranger to the world of drugs. A relative was quoted at Lee’s inquest as saying that the family owns a cannabis farm. As for Lee he was approaching 50 years old and felt he was running out of time to make his mark. He told Gerald that this deal was going to be the “big one”. In his own words, according to the inquest, it was “do or die”. Lee’s plan for Lebanon was straightforward enough. He would fly out there in late 2015 to oversee a drug deal with the help of his host, Adonis Al Masri, the inquest heard. But upon reaching the Bekaa Valley, Lee’s plan began to quickly unravel. The court heard details from friends and family about the strange things that began happening to him. In January 2016, he said he was abducted at gunpoint and interrogated for several hours by people with American accents. He believed they were working for the CIA. The following month, while applying for a routine extension to his tourist visa, he claimed his passport was taken by the Lebanese authorities on the grounds that he was wanted by Interpol. British police later ascertained he was never, in fact, wanted by the organisation. These bizarre developments, coupled with an imploding marriage back home, started taking their psychological toll. At the inquest, a friend who had been in regular contact with Lee, said that he “went downhill massively”. He lost weight, and would appear unkempt on video calls, at odds with his reputation for sharp dressing. A family member was quoted at the inquest as saying that Lee had told him that he’d had “a smoke on a few occasions”, and that he had taken that to be a reference to cannabis. The coroner speculated that if this were the case, it could have further fuelled Lee’s mood swings. “We cannot know,” she said. A member of the Al Masri family claimed that about a month before his death, Lee “had to be dragged down from a ladder after attempting to hang himself”, according to comments read out at the inquest. At other times, friends remember him rambling incoherently about being held by Isis and the Taliban. “He didn't sound like the same Lee I knew,” said one. Towards the end, the court was told, Lee grew convinced his hosts had turned on him, thinking that he was an undercover agent. “They're all whispering and talking about taking me away and having something done,” Andrew recalls him saying. In his final days, things escalated dramatically. Lee told another half-brother by text message on 15 April that his host “has had me done in over here”. “You need to get out ASAP,” his brother replied. The next day, Lee fled the house, stabbing a gardener in the process, only to be knocked down seconds later by a car in the street. Lee told his family that he had briefly gone to hospital. The court heard that after that reported incident, Lee was moved to the home of Shehade Habshi in the nearby village of Deir Al Ahmar. Habshi describes himself as a friend of the Al Masri family. Those back home who spoke to Lee at this time say he grew fixated with death, asking one friend to “look after his kids”, and telling his father Tom to have his body and blood checked in the event of his demise. In contrast, Shehade Habshi told the BBC that Lee was “happy” in his household, eating healthily and bonding with his hosts over food, even teaching them how to make fish soup. On 20 April 2016, Shehade says he went out to buy some honey at Lee’s request. When he came back, he found Lee hanging from his front door. The Lebanese authorities later declared it a suicide, though Lee’s father and half-brother, Gerald, insist to this day that he was murdered. Hundreds of mourners gathered at St John’s church in the heart of Middlesbrough to give Lee Harrison his final send-off on 20 May 2016. Pallbearers carried his coffin into the church to the sound of Natural Mystic by Bob Marley. The mourners heard about Lee’s devotion to his three children. Delivering the eulogy, a friend said Lee lived an “action-packed 50 years”. He added: “He was streetwise and had a special bond with his dad wheeling and dealing – that was the family trade.” Back in Lebanon, the authorities were investigating. A news report in the local Daily Star newspaper on the day Lee died said it was initially believed he had taken his own life. But it quoted doctors as saying that they didn’t believe he had killed himself. The BBC has seen the Lebanese police report into Lee’s death. The first medical examiner was inconclusive – he could not determine whether Lee had taken his own life or had been murdered. He told the BBC that he “was not happy” about the process but would not comment further. Two other medical examiners later concluded that Lee killed himself. A UK pathologist who examined Lee’s body agreed that it was likely he died from hanging. Adonis Al Masri was questioned by Lebanese police and denied having any business ties with Lee. The BBC repeatedly contacted the Lebanese businessman - who has no criminal record - for comment, but he didn't respond to the requests. In the UK, the inquest into Lee’s death returned an open verdict in December 2017. The coroner said: “There is no evidence Lee was unlawfully killed, but I can’t be certain he intended to take his own life.” She also said that it was the opinion of the British police that it was highly likely that Lee was involved in some “organised criminality” while in Lebanon. During the inquest, Gerald said in a statement: “Lee is a like a 10% man. He would introduce people to people, he told me this. I think Adonis did the introduction to the main supplier or cultivator, the main source.” So why did things end so badly? Well, the inquest heard that a relative of Adonis Al Masri had told British police that Adonis had in fact stolen £150,000 from Lee, causing the drug deal to collapse. The inquest also heard that Gerald believed that Lee was the “surety, the living surety, and because it never happened, they made an example of him”. The reality is we will probably never know exactly what happened in these final days. But Lee’s father is in little doubt. “I know my son and there’s no way he would take his own life,” says Tom. “He had too much to live for. He loved his children.” We still do not know for sure whether the drugs deal was for cannabis or captagon, or indeed something else. But in one of our last telephone calls, Tom told the BBC he believed the drug deal was for MDMA, or ecstasy. Lebanon is not known for producing that specific drug – although seizures of ecstasy are on the increase in the country. The shadowy world of illicit drugs is constantly evolving and throwing up surprises. Lee Harrison had travelled a long way from those early, euphoric nights at the Havana club. But in the end, it may have been ecstasy that killed Hooligan X. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9758036
" Mission Jurassic: Searching for dinosaur bones Mission Jurassic: Searching for dinosaur bones By Jonathan Amos The stench was unbearable. The hulking mass of dead dinosaur had lain on the sandbar now for over a week in stifling heat, half-buried among the decaying vegetation and sediment. Some scavengers had tried to rip the putrid flesh from its bones, but the floodwaters kept washing over the site, dumping yet more mud and debris. The open carcass of this 40-tonne giant was filling with all kinds of muck and beginning to disappear from view. The Earth itself was consuming the animal for geologic preservation. Fast-forward 150 million years and the University of Manchester’s Phil Manning is on his knees in a tennis court-sized quarry in the ""Badlands"" of North Wyoming. He's narrating this Jurassic death story as he points to the tangle of fossil bones in front of us. Remnants of leg, shoulder and spine have been worked proud of the sandstone. There's no doubting even to our untrained eyes that this is a sauropod - one of those huge plant-eating dinos that had a long neck and a long tail. Phil scrambles to his right to put his hand on a long stretch of brown-coloured rock. It's the fallen tree trunk that probably corralled the rotting beast and finally pulled it from the torrent, along with who knows how many other creatures now frozen in stone in this quarry. Phil sits back on his heels. He's like the detective who's just walked in on a murder scene, assessed the available evidence and constructed an initial take on the final moments of horror. ""Just imagine: a fetid mess of deadness. Wonderful!"" he grins.  ""It's rare that you get to see so many bones strewn in front of you like this. There are so many on this site it's like 'pick-up sticks',"" the British scientist continues. ""There's probably enough dinosaur material here to keep a thousand palaeontologists happy for a thousand years."" Phil doesn't have quite that long. The Children's Museum of Indianapolis (TCMI), where he's also a scientist in residence, has signed a 20-year exploration lease on a parcel of Wyoming ranch land measuring one sq mile (260 hectares) in area. Phil therefore has just two decades, the remainder of his career, to see what treasures can be unearthed. And he needs every bit of help he can get. That's why, in addition to TCMI staff, he's called in Dutch colleagues from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, and UK associates from the University of Manchester, and London's Natural History Museum (NHM). From the UK's perspective, ""Mission Jurassic"", as it's been dubbed, represents arguably the country's biggest dinosaur hunt in decades. Phil and his co-chief scientist, Victoria Egerton, have organised the partners into work teams to systematically scrape back the layers of two pilot quarries. The participants are down on all fours, edging forwards in CSI formation, gently probing the pliable sediments with bayonets. When you hit dinosaur bone, it sounds different, says NHM PhD student Joe Bonsor as he invites us to get in the dirt and ""have a go"". To illustrate his point, he picks up a piece and taps it with his knife to produce a kind of metallic chinking noise. The porous material also sticks hard to your tongue if you lick it, and again Joe demonstrates. ""Yeah, you have to be careful with that one; prairie dog poo has the same effect,"" quips his NHM supervisor Susie Maidment. The positions of fossils are first marked with flags to show everyone where not to tread. Although, with some bones nearly 2m in length, they’re pretty obvious. Discoveries are then mapped and prepped for removal. Extraction involves digging a pedestal around the specimen before giving it a plaster-of-Paris covering. It’s a messy job, but the hard “jacket”, when it eventually sets, will provide protection for the ride back to the lab. So far, Mission Jurassic has definitively identified at least four of those mighty sauropods. One could be 30m nose-to-tail; another perhaps 24m. There are some meat-eating allosaurs, too, waiting to be transported off-site.These finds barely begin to describe the potential of what's here, however. And it's not just bones: it's also the trackways left by dinosaurs as they sploshed through mud, now turned to stone, and a profusion of fossil plants that record what these giants ate.  Wyoming boasts a breathtaking landscape: mountains and plains and everything in between. We're in hot, arid terrain in the Big Horn basin, close to the border with Montana. Cowboys are mending fences and the prairie dogs are scuttling between the juniper bushes.   Precisely where we are, we're not allowed to say. There are fossil thieves who would almost certainly try to raid the square mile if they knew its location. We're even asked to switch off the geotagging on our phones and to avoid taking photographs that feature the horizon. An overly revealing social media post might give the game away. Not that dinosaurs are hard to find in these parts. Wyoming is the US state where the ""bone rush"" really began back in the 1870s. As the railroad pushed west after the Civil War, reports began to emerge of a fossil bounty, of countless specimens literally falling out of the hillsides. Today, all self-respecting palaeontologists have to make at least one pilgrimage to the state during their lives. From Pangea to the present day From Pangea to the present day Its geology captures a huge segment through the Mesozoic Era, the time when dinosaurs came to prominence.  A particular draw is the Morrison Formation, a roughly 10-million-year sequence of rocks from the Late Jurassic Period. This covers an immense swathe of the US western interior, but Wyoming hosts some of its most spectacular outcrops. ""The Morrison's got all the dinosaurs we knew when we were seven - Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus and Allosaurus. It's incredibly rich,"" says Susie Maidment who's come here in the hope of finding new species, or at least some slightly different versions of her childhood favourites. What makes the Morrison so rich in fossils is the ancient environment it reflects. One hundred and fifty million years ago, Wyoming was anything but arid. It was semi-tropical and featured big rivers that meandered across vast plains. ""There was a lot of rain, a lot of storms - a lot of water being pushed around, and that means a lot of sediment being pushed around as well,"" explains local palaeontologist Jack Turnbull. ""Flash floods, mudslides, landslides - and all that moving sediment, every now and then, would bury animals and plants on a large scale. It's the only way we can explain the productivity of fossils that we find in the Morrison."" But as hazardous as this all sounds, it was also a time when the animals living on these wide river plains found great success. And this is evident in the size of the sauropods. Only whales in Earth history have out-bulked these creatures, and the Late Jurassic is when their gigantism kicks in. That's something of a puzzle, says TCMI and Manchester scientist  Victoria Egerton as she scratches at a crumbling cliff face and pulls out yet more of the Morrison's preserved vegetation. ""The plants are completely different from what we see around us today; flowering plants had yet to evolve,"" she explains, breaking open chunks of mudstone with her fingers to reveal fossil stems and twigs. ""In fact, these dinosaurs were eating things that we would consider to be very nutritionally poor - things like conifers (think 'monkey puzzle' trees), ferns, ginkgos, cycads and large horsetails. And we would love to be able to understand how they ate this food and still got to be the enormous sizes they evidently did."" In a circular way, part of the answer lies in the fact that they were so big. If you want to derive as much calorific value as possible from so impoverished a feedstock, you employ a giant fermentation tank. That's essentially what sauropods were: colossal fermentation tanks on legs. And with their long necks they would rake vegetation from their surroundings for perhaps 16-20 hours a day. They can't have had much time for sleep. ""They were extraordinary animals,"" says NHM palaeobiologist Paul Barrett. ""Colleagues have called them 'ecosystem engineers' because their behaviour would have had a major effect on the physical appearance of an environment, not just in eating the vegetation but in clearing it out. ""Think also about the effects they would have had in terms of the geochemistry from their defecation as they moved through the landscape. ""The runoff would be influencing the amount of nutrients entering rivers. The seeds they dispersed were potentially controlling the distribution and germination of a number of different types of plants."" The history of science is littered with rivalries but the animosity that drove Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope was something else. These two individuals went to war in the 1870s to prove their paleontological prowess and intellectual superiority. The collectors turned Wyoming and adjoining states into a fossil battlefield as they raced to unearth and describe new dinosaurs. To try to out-do each other, they employed the most underhand of tactics, including bribery and sabotage. Every scientific publication by one was immediately trashed by the other. Marsh's and Cope's obsession nearly bankrupted them both. But in this manic pursuit of one-upmanship, they pushed the science forward, introducing to the world more than 130 new species of dinosaur. One of their big reveals was Stegosaurus, the rhino-sized animal that's instantly recognisable to all thanks to the row of sharp bony plates along its spine. Visitors to London'sNatural History Museumcan see a particularly fine example. This specimen, nicknamed ""Sophie"", is the most complete in the world. It was discovered in the Morrison Formation in 2003, just down the road from the Mission Jurassic dig site. Sophie's story is a good illustration of what will happen next to the creatures currently being pulled from the Badlands rock. Their bones will go to the TCMI lab where they'll be relieved of their plaster jackets, cleaned of any extraneous sediment and then subjected to a battery of tests. Whereas early palaeontologists might have done little more than describe the beasts and try to reassemble their bones in a best-fit posture, today's researchers use an ever-more sophisticated set of tools to bring the animals back to life - in the digital sense. Bones loaded on to the back of a truck Bones loaded on to the back of a truck The fossils are examined to see where ligaments and tendons attached. Computer models will then add muscle and skin; feathers even, if there's evidence they were present. Bob Nicholls / Paleocreations 2014 Bob Nicholls / Paleocreations 2014 This is where those preserved trackways are insightful because all this information can be used to reconstruct a dinosaur's movement, and that will help with the broader picture of how the animal negotiated its environment: what kind of distances could it cover? How much energy would that mobility expend? One of the newer techniques involves fine X-ray investigation of the fossils to look at their chemical make-up. ""This can tell you how fast the animal was growing and whether it experienced some hard periods in its life because that growth was stunted,"" says TCMI's Jennifer Anné. ""If you're really, really fortunate, you might find something we call medullary bone, which we think means the dinosaur was getting ready to lay eggs. You can also see if they had an injury and how well it healed; and sometimes you can see evidence of disease, maybe an infection or arthritis.""  Sophie displayed no obvious defects on her bones, nothing that points to disease or predation. The suspicion is she may simply have been unlucky and died from starvation during one bad season. Today, the technology that's having a major impact on palaeontology is 3D printing. This is revolutionising scientists' ability to study and share specimens. ""It's so easy to do scaling,"" says Anne Schulp, another vertebrate palaeontologist from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. ""If you have a younger, smaller Triceratops with some bones missing, you simply go to a larger animal, dial down the size of its bones and click print. And it's great for education. We now have a T. rex that you can download and build yourself."" The bones of the Mission Jurassic sauropods are somewhat jumbled up; quite a few are missing. It's going to require therefore a bit of interpretation and printing to reconstruct the animals. The Indianapolis Children’s Museumhas first claim to keep and display the giants, but both Naturalis and the Natural History Museum could easily mount their own 3D copies back in Europe. ""Do you want to see the Sundance? It's pretty special,"" says Mark Graham, an NHM fossil preparator. ""If you do, we've really got to go now before it gets too hot."" The Sundance is the ""big bonus"" in the Mission Jurassic square mile.  It's an older sequence of rocks that sits below the Morrison and records a time when Wyoming was covered by a shallow inland sea. Thus its fossils are likely to be of marine creatures. We head off in the SUV along a rutted track to a nearby ridge. To go back in time in the Jurassic we must descend, and that means clambering down the steepest of inclines. Almost immediately the heat hits us. The south-facing slope has been soaking up the Sun and even though it's only 11 in the morning, we feel now as though we're being roasted from below and above. After a few minutes, we break our downward slide and catch breath on a level platform of rock. Tim Ewin, an invertebrate specialist with the NHM, walks up and drops something shocking into our hands. A pile of bullets. It can't be! And fortunately that instant fear quickly gives way to relief. The dark ""ammunition"" we're holding is actually belemnites - the fossil remains of squid-like creatures that swam in great abundance in the Sundance Sea 160-170 million years ago. How abundant? We look around and realise the ground is littered with them. They're everywhere. And it's not just belemnites. We're directed also to the distinctive shape of ""devil's toenails"", or Gryphaea to use their scientific name. These were ancient oysters whose fossilised shells resemble satanic nail clippings. We carry on down the slope to where Mark has removed a tarpaulin from a tangled mass of fossil bones. It's a ""sea dragon"", also referred to as an ichthyosaur, a hugely successful marine reptile that looked a bit like a large dolphin. It would have dined on the aforementioned belemnites. The NHM man can't hide his irritation, though. This specimen has been badly damaged at some point by fossil thieves who clearly tried to remove the bones in a hurry and made a dreadful hash of it. ""It's one of the worst examples of privateering you'll see,"" he says. Nonetheless, this incomplete specimen may yet hold valuable science. It will be extracted (properly) and examined for clues as to how it lived and died. Ichthyosaurs gave birth to live young. If this was a pregnant female, her progeny may have been fossilised with her. But as fascinating as the sea dragon is, it's not the reason we've suffered the drop into this oppressive heat trap. That's another 20-30m further on, and when we arrive at the next ledge we find Richard Herrington, the NHM's head of Earth sciences, already gently prising apart delicate sheets of rock with a bayonet. Mark puts a grey slab at our feet and opens his palms. As he does so, the slab splays, its individual layers separating like the paper pages in a book.   These lithographic limestone and mudstone layers represent the sediments that settled at the bottom of an ancient, hyper-saline lagoon. Any animals that swam into, or fell into, this shallow pool probably suffocated in its quiet, super-salty, oxygen-poor waters. It's a setting however that makes for truly remarkable preservation and the entire Mission Jurassic consortium is especially excited about the potential of these particular fossil beds. Already insects and plants are turning up in these paper-thin layers. Fish too. ""It's amazing. You can see every small bone in life position; their scales and fins as well,"" enthuses Tim Ewin. The scientists say the deposits remind them of the famous Solnhofen limestones from southern Germany which have yielded some of the most spectacular of all Late Jurassic fossils, including one of palaeontology's true ""rock stars"" - Archaeopteryx, the winged creature that essentially proved the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds. Could these Wyoming sediments hold something similar? For the NHM and Naturalis, there is now great desire to join the Children's Museum in making a long-term commitment to this square mile of Badlands. The possibilities seem overwhelming. The London institution is talking of opening its own dedicated quarry where students could be brought over for training, even museum donors to see where their money is going. ""It would be an important statement from us that we still do expeditions; we still do 'live' science,"" says Richard Herrington. ""We want to say loudly that we're collecting new stuff, not just working on old material. We're modern and we're addressing the latest research questions."" Back up at one of the quarries, Phil Manning is turning a large crystal lump in his hands. When bone has been in the ground for a long time, its calcium is liberated into the surrounding sediments to form gypsum. Finding chunks of the mineral is a sign that more dinosaur remains are close.But at this precise moment, the Manchester man is very excited because his team has just had a eureka moment. Looking at the melange of sauropod fossils in front of them, it’s clear now how the different pieces fit together to make a massive pelvis. “Do you know, fear was what I felt when I first walked on to this site because I realised we were getting into something really huge. But it's something we just have to do because the material is so wonderful. ""Every single palaeontologist from every museum and every university who comes to work here will dream about this place at night.” Publication date: 15 August 2019 ",Negative,0.014204407
" By Paul Rincon   A 12-wheeled vehicle kicks up a haze of gunpowder-grey dust as it makes tracks across undulating terrain. The “space truck” has a pressurised cabin, allowing the two astronauts inside to breathe without their spacesuits. They’re tired after a day spent investigating water-ice deposits a few kilometres from their base. This is the Moon in 2050.   As the rover rounds the imposing sides of a large crater, the astronauts catch the glint of mirrors mounted on its rim. The mirrors beam sunlight into the crater, powering a mining operation to extract water-ice within. On the left, the truck passes a landing pad - flattened out by microwaving the lunar soil - where an ascent vehicle sits waiting to blast into orbit. The vehicle pulls up by the domes of a base, here at the Moon’s South Pole. The astronauts enter their habitat through an airlock and remove their dusty spacesuits. Inside, a greenhouse that’s growing kale and potatoes emits an unearthly glow under LED lights. The crew members climb the steps to an upper level, where the base commander awaits them for a debrief. Scenarios like this are fantasy, for now. But it’s one possible way humans could live and work on the Moon. If we want to establish a long-term base, we’ll have to take what we need from lunar resources.  Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through"" Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through""  In her lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, PhD student Hannah Sargeant is working on a way to do just this, using a mineral called ilmenite that’s abundant on the Moon. Inside a bench-top oven, the ilmenite is heated to extract oxygen, which is combined with hydrogen to get water. “There are 20-plus ways of getting water from rocks on the Moon. Ilmenite was of interest because it’s quite common there and the reaction that you need uses relatively little energy,” she explains. And she says she’s excited at the prospect of humans returning to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. “I feel like my generation are definitely going to see this through. I’m confident that it will happen in my lifetime, that we will have – at least – permanent habitation in orbit around the Moon, and then you have a continued back-and-forth to the surface.”  Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972 Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972  In 2017, Donald Trump signed a space policy directive to return American astronauts to the Moon, and on to “other destinations”. Nasa said it would aim to do this by 2028. But recently the administration directed the space agency to bring that forward to 2024, citing Chinese lunar ambitions. It hasn't gone unnoticed, however, that the date would coincide with the end of Trump's second term, should he be re-elected. This time round, Nasa wants to do things differently. The Moon is part of a bigger ambition to explore deep space, including Mars, so part of the plan is to establish a lunar outpost. “We're not going back to the Moon to leave flags and footprints and then not go back for another 50 years,” Nasa’s administrator Jim Bridenstine said earlier this year. “We're going to go sustainably - to stay - with landers and robots and rovers and humans."" But can Nasa safely mount a return mission by the deadline, given that critical hardware has neither been built nor flight-tested? “It’s going to be risky,” says John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in DC. But he adds: “If we’re not willing to accept a certain level of risk, then we should stay on the ground. The issue is balancing risk with activity.” Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin  Previous Nasa lunar missions have been named after the Greek god Apollo. The next will be named Artemis after his mythical twin sister, and there is already speculation about the identity of the agency's first female Moonwalker. Nasa has 38 active astronauts, 12 of whom are women. They include Kate Rubins, a microbiologist who has studied some of Earth’s deadliest diseases; Jeanette Epps, a former CIA technical officer; Serena Aunon-Chancellor, a doctor; and Christina Koch, an electrical engineer. Jim Bridenstine recently told CNN: “It will be somebody who has been proven, somebody who has flown, somebody who has been on the International Space Station already.”  Stephanie Wilson has the most flight experience, having been on three shuttle missions. Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Sunita Williams, have each logged two flights. “As it is now, we demand more when you're looking at functional performance of an astronaut, than we ever have in history,” says Michael Barratt, a Nasa astronaut and honorary professor at the University of Exeter Medical School, UK. “The astronaut of today flies a multi-national vehicle for six months and has to be uber-trained, basically, in spacewalking, robotic arm operation, all sorts of systems, has to be functionally bilingual in English and Russian, and cope with isolation and confinement for six months at a time.”     But what additional challenges will they face beyond Earth’s orbit? We already have a good understanding of the changes that occur to the human body in space. “I like to say that we literally become extra-terrestrials,” says Barratt, who is also a medical doctor. “Your anatomy changes, your physiology changes, your biochemistry changes. And we still function right along, it really is quite remarkable.” Astronauts will face hazards working on the lunar surface. “Though it's only one-sixth of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, you're going to be wearing a very heavy suit, carrying tools and implements and excavating, climbing, digging, and exploring. That's what really adds its own set of risks,” Barratt says. Astronauts could break bones in a fall, or put a pick through their spacesuit. Then there’s the issue of dust from the lunar surface. The Apollo astronauts experienced episodes of coughing and, in some cases, breathing problems when dust became airborne inside their spacecraft. A way to control that will need to be found. Radiation poses one of the biggest challenges. Outside the protective magnetic bubble surrounding Earth, astronauts are exposed to roughly three times the radiation dose per day they receive in low-Earth orbit. It contributes to an increased risk of long-term problems such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.   The radiation comes from several sources. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have lots of energy, but there are few of them. The Van Allen Belts around Earth contain trapped sub-atomic particles, but exposure to these is temporary. However, ways need to be found to protect against solar particle events (SPEs) - where the Sun periodically hurls electrically charged particles into space. Nasa’s next-generation ship, Orion, uses materials within its structure to shield the occupants from radiation.  The cornerstone of America’s plan to return to the Moon is the Orion crew module. Its conical contours recall the Apollo command modules, rather than the spaceplane stylings of its immediate predecessor, the space shuttle. To many people, the spacecraft evokes a golden age of space exploration, when anything seemed possible. But the 10-tonne spacecraft makes use of technology unimaginable back in the 1960s, and even the methods being used to build it are innovative. At Lockheed Martin, which is building Orion for Nasa, engineers have been equipped with augmented reality (AR) headsets. “You’re looking through a lens that’s a see-through visor, but then you have these digital objects that are overlaid in the environment,” explains Shelley Peterson, emerging technologies lead at Lockheed. By using instructions superimposed over a view of the real world, technicians can easily determine where to drill a hole, or mark the location of a cable fastener.  This also means that they don't have to refer to a manual that might run to thousands of pages, enabling them to work quicker and more efficiently. “We had a person on Orion who was near retirement,” says Peterson. “He was expressing that he might push out his retirement so he could experience it on the shop floor.” Compared with Apollo, “Orion is much more dense in terms of its capabilities per cubic foot,” says Rob Chambers, senior manager systems engineering at Lockheed Martin. “That’s one of the reasons it was complex to design and build.” Orion was originally part of President George W Bush’s plan to return to the Moon, which was announced in 2004. When that programme was cancelled in 2010 under the Obama administration, it was the only element to survive. Orion’s four flight computers can run pretty much everything on the spacecraft without intervention from humans, making the spacecraft very self-sufficient. In this respect, says Chambers, Orion is a “real generational step-up”.  Shelley Peterson Shelley Peterson  The computers are of a type built for Boeing’s 787 commercial airliner. But they have been toughened up for the rigours of space travel, where G-forces, vibration and radiation can damage delicate hardware. “That’s why we have four sets of flight computers, it’s not because we expect them to burn out through electrical failure. It’s to handle that deep space environment,” Chambers adds. The computers aren’t the most up-to-date ones available. With space travel, tried-and-tested hardware is preferable to something that’s more innovative but less well-understood. The outside of the spacecraft also needs to be tough. Orion is designed to take hits from small space rocks, or particles of human-made debris in orbit around Earth.  If a breach were to cause Orion to lose its air, the spacecraft has to be able to get back home. Astronauts will be supplied with pressure suits to keep them alive in a vacuum. But the electronic systems (avionics) have been specially designed to lose heat without fans blowing air over them. When Orion returns to Earth, the largest heat shield ever built will protect the crew inside from the temperatures of 2,760C (5,000F) it could experience during re-entry to the atmosphere. The heat shield will use elements of thermal protection systems used on the space shuttle and robotic missions to Mars. As it falls towards the ground, Orion will deploy a total of 11 different parachutes – most of which are made from a hybrid of Kevlar and Nylon - to slow the vehicle down to the speed of 27 km/h (17mph) required to safely splash down in the Pacific Ocean. An amphibious transport ship will be waiting nearby to retrieve the astronauts. The ship then tows Orion onto a flooded well deck and lifts it into a recovery cradle for the journey home.  Orion is one big part of the Moon return plan. Another is the rocket that will carry it into space. The Space Launch System (SLS) is taller than a 30-storey building and will be able to launch payloads of up to 130 metric tonnes – the equivalent of 10 of London's New Routemaster buses. “It is truly an immense rocket. It is just jaw-droppingly big,” says John Shannon, vice president and programme manager for the SLS at Boeing, which is building the rocket for Nasa. The SLS re-uses technology developed for the space shuttle. But the new rocket is a completely different beast. The huge core stage is based on the external tanks that fed propellant to the shuttle’s main engines. Its two solid rocket boosters are also modified shuttle elements. But this created challenges, because the SLS exerts very different levels of stress on components. “We took some of the hardware from the space shuttle and put it in that environment and it did not survive,” Shannon explains. “We had to go back and do significant re-designs in a number of instances.” One of the big challenges was ensuring the rocket’s engine section could cope with shaking from the powerful solid rocket boosters. Engineers had to take individual components and “qualify” them, proving they could survive the vibration. The engine section gets very hot during flight, so engineers are insulating it with sheets of cork - the very same stuff you’d find in the neck of a wine bottle. Cork is full of air spaces, making it one of the best thermal insulating materials available. Developing it has cost about $12.5bn (£10bn), and a government oversight report released in June detailed cost overruns totalling $1.8bn. John Shannon believes things are now looking up. “We’ve been through the hard part: the qualification and design of the hardware,” he says. “We’re at a great point right now, the factory is humming, we’ve got our first vehicle, it will roll out of the door by the end of this year.” Its maiden flight is expected to take place no earlier than June 2020. But not everyone thinks this is the best way to go. There are those who think it would be best to launch on commercial rockets like those being developed separately by billionaire entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Robert Zubrin, from Colorado-based company Pioneer Astronautics, has come up with a plan called Moon Direct which would use less powerful commercial rockets to launch a versatile spacecraft to the Moon. Zubrin believes that with two launches a year at a cost of $1bn (£800m) each, the SLS could be put to much better use, such as pushing on to Mars. John Shannon says his team “knows what they’re doing, how unique it is - and how difficult it is,” adding: “I suspect that once SLS is in the national capability, there won’t be a need for another heavy-lift vehicle like it for many years. So this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”  Why is the US building a space station in lunar orbit? It seems like a legitimate question, given that astronauts got along just fine without one 50 years ago. “The purpose of the Gateway is really as a waystation to get to the surface of the Moon and push on to Mars,” says Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. The company’s John Shannon could be described as the architect of Gateway. While working at Nasa around 2011, he was tasked with figuring out what was next in human exploration. “I sat down and went through every single design reference mission Nasa had produced for the last 20 years. It was a stack four feet tall,” he says. A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024 A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024  Shannon started to focus on ideas that were viable. “What made a lot of sense was the ability to build a very small crew-tended space station around the Moon,” he says. “Gateway gives you a place for crews to get set up before they go down to the surface. It gives you an opportunity to control remote vehicles on the surface.” It would also act as a safe haven were anything to go wrong during a mission. The Apollo missions took all the hardware necessary for completing the mission with them to the Moon. Nasa put them on a path around the Moon called a free return trajectory, which would get them safely back to Earth if, for example, an engine didn’t fire to send them into lunar orbit. But this limited them to landing in a narrow band around the equator. Gateway will be higher up, in an oval-shaped path around the Moon called a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), giving Nasa the ability to land wherever it wants. “That means you have to stage further away from the Moon, so you can make your decision there as to: ‘Do I want to go to the poles or do I want to go to the equator?’” says Chambers.   The station won’t be complete in time for the 2024 mission. But Orion could dock with a stripped-down version, consisting of a power and propulsion module and a small habitat for crew. Eventually, says John Shannon, Gateway “could be a place where you aggregate all the logistics you needed for a Mars transfer vehicle”. The outpost remains controversial. Dr Robert Zubrin, author of the book The Case for Space, sees it as an unnecessary stop on the way to the Moon, and refers to it as a lunar orbit tollbooth. But John Logsdon of George Washington University says: “If all you wanted to do was land at the South Pole of the Moon, I’m not sure Gateway is essential. But the plan calls for an initial landing in 2024 and a sustainable programme by 2028 – first to the Moon and then to Mars. If you’re going to do that programme, then Gateway is an important element.”  It was arguably the defining event of the century. On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin were fast approaching the Moon’s surface in their lunar module (LM) spacecraft. For reasons unknown, the LM was veering off course, four miles downrange of the intended landing site. During the final 2,000 feet (610m) of the automatic descent, Armstrong looked out the window and saw the LM was heading for a large crater surrounded by boulders as big as cars. Landing here would have been catastrophic. As the LM approached the 500-foot (152m) mark, Armstrong assumed manual control of the spindly craft and flew it like a helicopter. He piloted the LM over the crater and the boulders, landing safely on a flat plain. Future landings will need to be safer and more precise. “You’re going to need much more capable autonomous landing systems,” says Ken Gabriel, chief executive of Draper in Boston. “That means the ability to do things like terrain feature navigation, where the way you know where you are on the Moon is to look at, in real-time, and process the scenery that you’re seeing through the camera systems of the landers.   “You need to not only recognise where you are but, with sub-metre accuracy, figure out where you’re going to be and how to avoid obstacles as you get close. All the things that Neil Armstrong did with his eyes and his brain and his hands when he was landing on the Moon, we’re going to have to invest that capability into autonomous landers.” Landing at the South Pole of the Moon will be a thrilling spectacle. When astronauts venture outside, they might be wearing spacesuits like the Z-2 prototype. It’s designed to give the wearer greater mobility than previous suits, allowing explorers to go uphill and downhill, and bend over to pick up rocks. Lifting off from the Moon could be challenging. “When you're launching from the Earth, you're launching from a fixed and known launch site,” says Dr Seamus Tuohy, from Draper Lab. On the Moon, he explains, everything depends on where you’ve landed and how the vehicle is sitting. The lander, which for 2024 hasn't been built, perhaps sums up better than any element the anxiety felt around the accelerated timeline. There’s no hardware to speak of yet, and it remains unclear how it will be tested before 2024. But Robert Zubrin argues that five-and-a-half years is enough time to build and test the lander. “Gateway itself is sapping funds from the development of a lander, which you actually do need if you want to land on the Moon,” he says. Robot 3D printing on the Moon Robot 3D printing on the Moon  It's not all about landing on the Moon, some people are already getting ready for a lunar economy. Space company Astrobotic says it's building a ""railroad"" to the Moon. It's one of a number of companies that want to transport items to the lunar surface. The railroad metaphor seems particularly apt for a company with its headquarters in the former heart of American steel manufacturing, Pittsburgh. For a price, starting at $450 (£358) for small items such as keepsakes and rising to $1.2m per kg for heavier items such as robot rovers, Astrobotic will deliver the payload of your choice to the Moon, using its four-legged Peregrine robot lander.  Astrobotic’s customer manifest includes time capsules, science instruments, a rock from Mount Everest and a token from Kennywood, a well-known Pittsburgh amusement park. Astrobotic lander Astrobotic lander  By providing end-to-end delivery services for private customers and Nasa, companies like Astrobotic could make the first steps towards building a sustainable lunar economy. “We can have providers in space making rocket fuel, making other materials, providing services. Then Nasa’s investment, or Esa’s investment doesn’t need to cover the entire cost of that infrastructure,” says Dr Philip Metzger, a planetary scientist from the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Tourism is likely to be another early lunar revenue source. In 2018, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon in 2023. That date will probably slip, but a Japanese billionaire has paid an undisclosed amount to go there on Musk’s cheekily-titled Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) vehicle. Further into the future, tourists could land on the lunar surface and stay in habitats. UBS estimates that space tourism will be a $3bn (£2.3bn) market by 2030. But mining water-ice for rocket fuel is likely to be the foundation of a lunar economy. These deposits are concentrated at the North and South Poles, where the interiors of some craters never see sunlight. Never exposed to enough heating to boil them away, deposits of water-ice – perhaps billions of tonnes – persist in these shadowed craters. Re-fuelling vehicles at the Moon could bring down the cost of space travel and make a lunar outpost more affordable. A 2018 report suggests rocket propellant could be produced at a cost of $500 per kg on the lunar surface. That’s 20-times cheaper than the $10,000 per kg projected cost of transporting it from Earth to lunar orbit. Lunar propellant could also be used to boost satellites from low-Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher, geostationary orbit. A spacecraft carrying fuel from the Moon could rendezvous with a satellite in LEO and use the propellant to push it to its final orbit. This could save around $100m (£79m) per spacecraft. However, Dr Paul K Byrne, from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says a lunar economy will take time to develop. “We can see where we want to go. But it's got to be decades before this is even remotely commercially viable,” he says. “Until then, it's going to be something that governments have to bankroll.” A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners  The Artemis plan culminates with the deployment in 2028 of a Lunar Surface Asset - in other words, a base. In the early stages of settling the Moon, inflatable modules made from multiple layers of fabric might be the best option. They can be collapsed, taking up less space in a rocket than rigid modules, and provide more living space when expanded. The European Space Agency, along with UK architects Foster + Partners, have come up with a hybrid design. Their habitat consists of an inflatable, two-storey living space and a rigid module acting as an airlock. Paul K Byrne Paul K Byrne  To protect these habitats against micrometeoroid strikes and radiation, robots could 3D-print hard outer shells that could sit over the habitats. Lunar “soil”, or regolith, could even be used as the building material. “It’s an easy construction method, and can be done rapidly,” says Philip Metzger. Longer-term, lunar settlers might move underground, setting up  home inside natural tunnels in the rock called lava tubes. This would give them a ready-made shelter from radiation. A prototype lunar greenhouse has already been developed at a University of Arizona facility in Tucson. Vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes and sweet potato are grown under LED lights. It’s more or less a closed loop, where water is recycled. The plants contribute to life support systems because they scrub carbon dioxide from the air and produce oxygen. A 12-wheeled prototype “truck” - the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) - has been designed by Nasa to help the astronauts get out to explore. Before water can be extracted, there will be some prospecting to do. Once promising deposits have been identified, robots could be used to dig them up. Philip Metzger thinks you could just heat the lunar soil so that the water is released as a vapour, so it can then be collected. Philip Metzger Philip Metzger  Power will be an issue in permanently shadowed craters. One way to get it in is by concentrating sunlight using mirrors mounted on a crater rim. “You take one of those mirrors and actively point it down at your rover,” says John Thornton, chief executive of Astrobotic. Most of the water from mining would then be turned into rocket fuel using an electric current to split the water molecules into their constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. Hannah Sargeant from the Open University is working on an instrument called ProSPA that aims to demonstrate water extraction from rocks on the lunar surface. ProSPA will launch in 2024 on a Russian robotic lander called Luna-27. Sargeant’s ilmenite experiment is a “breadboard model” that paves the way for a water extraction test on the Moon using ProSPA. This kind of demonstration is vital. Paul K Byrne explains: “People are building all these projects that will figure out how you might do it. But deploying it and testing, I think, is the next critical step for this to happen.”   Fifty years on, the Moon landings remain a powerful symbol of what can be achieved when we mobilise our talents and resources to inspire. Rivalry with the Soviet Union gave the US a compelling reason to go, but it was fleeting. Once the space race had been won, Project Apollo continued for just six more missions before it was cancelled. Time will tell whether 21st Century rationales for lunar exploration are more robust. “The single best reason to go back to the Moon, is to use it as a staging post to go beyond,” says Paul K Byrne, who cites Mars and asteroids as worthy targets for exploration. In the past 15 years, Nasa’s destination has changed from the Moon, to Mars, then back to the Moon. “The road has been winding, but it’s aimed outward,” says John Logsdon. “I think it has been since January 2004, when Bush announced what became Constellation. It has been aimed at re-starting US human travel beyond Earth orbit.” If Donald Trump were to lose the 2020 election, a new Democrat administration could cancel the Moon plan. But Logsdon considers this unlikely. “I think it’s much harder to think that a new government would cancel the return to the Moon programme, given how much momentum it’s building,” he explains. However, the Moon programme will need more money. For 2020, the Trump administration has asked for $1.6bn in additional funding. But Nasa needs $6bn to $8bn per year on top of its existing budget to carry out Artemis. Congress will need to authorise those funds. A return to the Moon has support from both sides of the aisle, but many legislators are sceptical of the 2024 deadline. The administration cited Chinese lunar ambitions while justifying the return date of 2024. Some observers think space-faring nations like the US, China and Russia will need to coordinate lunar exploration to navigate murky legal waters over who owns lunar resources. “I think there’s a very large risk of geopolitical conflict,” says Phil Metzger. “If a single nation decides to go it alone on creating industry in space, then eventually that single nation would have a tremendous political, economic and military advantage.” Ignoring the potential of space resources just creates a power vacuum, he says: “The ethical way to fill it would be to do it cooperatively, internationally, trying to make sure that all humanity benefits.” Author: Paul Rincon Graphics: Gerry Fletcher, Lilly Huynh, Salim Qurashi Images: NASA, Lockheed Martin, Phil Coomes, Foster + Partners Producers: Tom Housden, James Percy Editor: Kathryn Westcott",Negative,5.2872267e-09
